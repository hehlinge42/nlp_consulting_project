cd nlp_consulting_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Architecture

### Session 1: TripAdvisor scraper

* ``` cd cleaner ```

### Session 3: Feature Embedder

* Tool to embed tokenized reviews into numerical vector.
* ``` cd embedder ```

## Run from Command Line

```
python3 run_all.py --embedding_technique all --wordcloud_per_restaurant --tfidf_per_restaurant
```

Usage:
* --embedding_technique [str]: define embedding technique (lsi, word2vec, fasttext) supported.
* --wordcloud_per_restaurant [bool]: option to create wordclouds per restaurants.
* --tfidf_per_restaurant [bool]: option to create TFIDF embedding per restaurants.
