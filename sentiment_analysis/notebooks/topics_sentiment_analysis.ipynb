',\n"," 'This restaurant didn’t actually do anything wrong; the service was good, friendly and helpful; but the food doesn’t get anywhere near a quality to match what the restaurant is charging :( The whole place - both the hotel (reviewed elsewhere) and this restaurant - seem stuck in a time warp. The design would have been very suited to 15 years ago. However nothing has changed. I don’t think that people want to eat from a very limited (they only offer a choice of three puddings) menu in a drafty restaurant that’s filled with loud, electronic, music. The meal itself whilst it would have been acceptable was vastly overpriced. All the sauces were gelatinous and very heavily seasoned. The red wine sauce my husband had with his steak had an “almost burnt” flavour. Not enough to complain about but not good. The charge for the steak was #29. For this you got a steak, some rather gelatinous sauce and six (6!) chips.  As I’ve said we’re staying here and haven’t experienced the same problems with breakfast so I suspect that it’s a problem with dinner rather than the actual restaurant. I don’t have a problem taking breakfast here again as the main restaurant’s not open but we won’t be eating an evening meal here nor will we be recommending it.',\n"," 'On my second visit I was greeted by Salah ( not sure on the spelling) and she was extremely rude and impatient. Not a very good look. Amazing bartenders and waiters though!',\n"," 'This has been our favourite restaurant during the pandemic. They are always accommodating and make us feel special. For a couple of hours, it makes you feel there is no change in the world. Staff wear masks. Menu is on QR code. Service is always great and the food and drinks are delicious. Tables are spaced well apart and there is a one way system through the restaurant.',\n"," 'What a place michael and salla on front desk were amazing drinks were brilliant best place in London for views and people watching ',\n"," 'Great costumer service, Jessy took care of us and made it a holiday to remember, would definitely come back!',\n"," 'Don’t even know from where to start because everything was just a big misunderstanding. So we call before booking on the day to see if it’s worth to even try to book. I call the hostess and she is in a place where the music is so loud I can’t even hear her. She said yes they have tables. I come in, I’m fine with the table inside since they said there’s no available tables outside. They sat us right next to the door that everyone kept forgetting to close even after asked several times to either transfer us or jus CLOSE THE DOOR. The hostess is rude, waiters are rude. We are customers and you have to respect us, not have attitude. Simple questions piss them off. I’ve been here once before and the waiter was so rude we had to ask him to ask someone else to serve us. We thought we’ll give them another chance. But What is wrong with all the staff? Even bar staff just looks at everyone as if they don’t want people to be there. There’s so many beautiful rooftops in London and this is definitely not the one to go to have fun. ',\n"," \"Places like this, with no respect for Covid guidelines, are the reason restaurants are all being forced to close once again. They made a big show of asking us questions & taking our temperatures before we went inside, but once you're in there it's a complete free for all.  There was a table of 6 men next to us (who blatantly did not live together, because we heard them talking about it, very loudly) and a table of 2 women next to them. They joined their tables together, and staff were quite content to let them so long as they kept buying drinks - and not even a lot of drinks, the women have 4 cocktails between them, and the 6 men only ordered 2 bottles of champagne over the two hours we were there.  All 8 of them kept shouting and yelling all evening, spitting their germs across the place, getting up from their tables, moving chairs around, and behaving like unruly children at a 5-year-olds birthday party.  Completely ruined our evening, and to be honest, wouldn't be surprised if we end up with covid after being stuck sat next to them. Told the front of house about it and all they could do was say sorry, but didn't really seem bothered.\",\n"," 'Great service and lovely drinks. Thank you so much Otto, you are the best barman, so helpful and friendly - he deserves a pay rise! Thank you ',\n"," 'The perfect setting for this special meal.  All I can say is that the staff , the food, the service, the atmosphere was 100%. we could not find fault or criticise in any way, just a totally enjoyable evening,  Would highly recommend to anyone thinking of going  But very good idea to book in advance.',\n"," 'This is the usual for such a bar/restaurant unfortunately. Pumped up prices for the view. £7 for a bottle of beer, £17 for a cocktail. Surly waitress made no effort to accommodate our requests.',\n"," 'A friend of mine recommended it.  It’s lovely. Nice waitresses and waiters are very friendly and making you to feel great!  Prices are normal. What do you expect? A McDonald’s as a roof top bar? Drinks were fine and the food as well!  Definitely recommend it!',\n"," 'My friend and I went for breakfast, we wanted seating with a view and they gave us an option to sit outside or inside. We sat outside, it’s stunning. Service was v attentive by all staff. Mercedes was v friendly and looked after us very well, she made the experience even better. The views are incredible, you can see all the main London sites here. We had a fabulous time, would love to come back again in the evening. ',\n"," 'We only stopped in for a few sundowners so can’t comment on the food. Gorgeous bar with great views, delicious signature cocktails and great service. Good social distancing plan, however the man that greats you at the lift maybe takes it a step too far. Made us scan in four times which made no sense. Maybe a lack of understanding how the scanning app works.',\n"," 'Views may be good in the right seat but most seats are inside, when you’re sat at your table not allowed to move to an outdoor table for the views even if one come available. Although several other people did move to join other tables and this was just overlooked by staff even with covid restrictions in place. Cocktails were good but very overpriced especially when you don’t get the view that the overpriced cocktail pays for.',\n"," 'Was sat inside despite booking a month in advance. Asked 3 different members of staff if we could move outside as there was empty tables. This was denied by staff as government guidelines don’t allow table moving (news to me?!) and also watched them let two different tables who were talking across the room join in to one. Will never be back. One rule for one and one rule for another.',\n"," 'Came to this restaurant with a few of my friends during the Eat out to help out scheme. We did not get 50% off even though they advertised it and informed us that they offer it as we walked in, but our bill was full price. We were treated disrespectfully and the waiter was rude, food was cold and the view from our seats was terrible. We were sat on a sofa with a table as low as our knees so had to pickup our plates and eat off our knees. The food was cold and extremely overpriced. We asked for one selection of toast and got served and charged for two which is not what we asked for. Terrible, terrible place.',\n"," 'Staff where welcoming and, we had an outside table, which was still nice and warm as the covers where over and the heating on, on a good day the view will be amazing, sadly weather was awful today, but this didn’t spoil anything. Service was excellent and staff where attentive, you can scan a QR code with the menu on, it only shows their signature cocktails but they will make whatever you like. We had a couple of snacks and starters which where lovely, couldn’t fault. Yes it’s expensive, but it’s a rooftop bar in the middle of London!! Would definitely return, perhaps we will have a better view!! ',\n"," 'Absolutely shocking! A friend of ours, staying at the hotel, booked a table for ten of us When we got there (not at any point before) we were told that: _ because of COVID, they had a 6 people max policy per table _ they didn’t have any table outdoors with heaters or blankets If you know anybody that ever came here to sit indoors and have his group split on two tables... then I am really sirrry for you!! Avoid! The picture was taken during our stay, “no tables available outside, sorry!”',\n"," 'Why would you own a great venue like this only to employ staff that are so bloody rude and stuck up! Even if they owned it you would/should have more respect for your customers, we were staying at the hotel it was a Saturday afternoon we decided to go for a quick cocktail on the roof before we got ready for the evening, we were wearing jeans and trainers, very clean white trainers I might add, we asked for a table for 3 the two girls on the reception literally looked at us like we were trash, then told us no they had no tables, sorry, I said I can see loads of empty tables she said yes but they are reserved for hotel guest, I said great we are guests after taking our room number she gave us a table in the corner, I politely asked if we could have a table outside she said no as there were no tables for 3 outside!! She was completely now above her station at this point and then three over the top dressed women got taken to a table outside I then just insisted that I was going to sit outside, how dare anyone treat a customer like that I wasn’t going to get my drinks any cheaper, I believe my bill for 2 cocktails and a glass of prosecco was just over £60, overpriced yes but I knew that it would be but don’t treat me or any customer like crap because you don’t like how they are dressed on a Saturday afternoon, not that it matters but I am a director of my own company and I treat all of my staff how I wish to be treated! Change your staff or change their training',\n"," 'Absolutely awful, we booked a table online for 9:45. This would have been fine, however we were not informed the bar shut in a hour, this meant we had 30 minutes before the bar shut! We had a £100 voucher we were gifted for our friends birthday, and had to spend this in 30 minutes. The staff were so rude, and sat us inside, even though we wanted to sit outside on the FREE tables. We had to beg to move, and by that time we had 20 minutes to try and spend £100. The staff came around and said last orders were ready to be made, and that the kitchen had shut, which we were not informed of. To make matters worse, the staff allowed a different table to order and bought them out some fresh desert. This made us feel inferior.  Ruined my friends birthday night, would not recommend and wish we had been treated better. The only good thing was the view.',\n"," 'This is one of our favourite spots to have a few cocktails in London. The drinks are quirky and taste great! Y. Terrel made sure our visit was extra special as it was my birthday. She was really friendly and her service was impeccable. Would 100% recommend this bar.',\n"," 'My friend and I went to Radio Rooftop for the first time last night and had the most fantastic time, I am baffled by all these moany negative reviews!  The doormen, front of house and waiters couldn’t be friendlier. We were lucky to have great weather and an outside table with fantastic views. The food was delicious - we had chicken satay, patatas bravas, cheese ravioli and churros all of which we’d recommend. The cocktails were lovely. There was a minimum spend of £50 each as it was a Saturday. It’s pricey but it’s a fancy bar in London, if you don’t want to pay don’t go!  My only negative would be the womens toilets were an absolute state, felt like I was in a club at the end of the night! None of the locks worked, smelt bad, messy cubicles, glasses on the sink. This was disappointing as it didn’t fit the place plus was a shock when cleanliness is such a big thing in the current climate! ',\n"," 'I came here on Saturday (5th) and it was lovely! The staff were really friendly and the drinks were really good. I was a bit unsure when I came after some of the reviews but can honestly say I really enjoyed it. The only bad thing is not being able to see the views due to the weather but other than that was a really nice visit and excited to visit again. ',\n"," 'Cannot fault Radio Rooftop.  Allowed me to use a gift voucher which had recently expired and I was unable to use during lockdown. Fantastic staff, attentive and polite. The food was excellent. Would definitely go again.',\n"," 'Absolute quality breakfast in an amazing setting! Great food, great setting and great service! Great vegan choice. Breakfast tea was a bit slow to start but made up by the aforementioned.',\n"," \"Talk about over priced and very pretencious! Staff very friendly and tables were clean but I could not believe the prices.  £13 for a very small and average rose wine Lager was bottled which was then poured into a crystal glass, maybe that's why they charged so much. View lovely especially as the sun came down and south bank lit up. But the end bill that arrived put a downer on the evening really..... Very much a special occaision venue\",\n"," 'Never have I been to a place with such rude, obnoxious and care free staff. Such a massive shame as the bar is in a lovely setting with an amazing view, however the cocktails are overpriced and taste of either pure alcohol (not drinkable at all) or weak squash and the staff simply do not care about your service.  Had a voucher to use for my 21st birthday celebrations to which they were extremely reluctant to take and we received a blunt “my manager will accept your voucher” when there was nothing wrong with it... however this wasted 20 minutes of our expected 1 hr 45 at the bar. We eventually received our drinks 30 mins into our stay, revolting cocktails, definitely not worth the £18 per one. 5 mins later we got asked for last orders (waitress was so rude and just shrugged her shoulders not giving the slightest care), however we were not told this upon arrival so we were not impressed to have 30 mins to use the full voucher value when you could book a table up to 1.5hrs later than our arrival time. We then thought to use the voucher for some food instead of overpriced drinks, but her Care free response Again was “kitchen closed an hour ago” which again we were not told. I then stood up to take a photo and got shouted at by the rude waitress again.  10 minutes before close we were finally brought our drinks that were just shoved on our table without letting us know what was what and then the manager and 2 waitresses proceeded to present a plate of fresh desserts and cake to a table nearby giggling, yet we were told the kitchen had closed an hour ago but it was obviously open for staff to feed their friends.... Absolutely appalling customer service and quite frankly embarrassing on their behalf. Expected to have a 1hr 45 time slot as advertised when booking, however the bar closed within 40 minutes of arrival. Certainly will not be returning and would only recommend this bar for the view and if one wishes to pay £18 for a dribble of squash in a mug !',\n"," 'What a waste of money! I’m making the booking I explained that I suffered from a disability and that I would like sitting outside if the weather was fine if not could I be seated in doors. I found the hostesses to be nonchalant and not very welcoming. We were seated outside it was extremely windy and cold. We asked to be re-seated in doors as the cold was beginning to cause me extreme pain. It took over 20 minutes before we were offered sitting indoors at which point we were leaving. On the positive the cocktails whilst pricey were very good, Our server was very professional and approachable however too busy to be able to give the level of service we had expected. Not my first visit there but probably my last whilst it has impressive views for me that’s all it had going for it last night. There are several of the better venues in London where you can get just as good view with better service.',\n"," 'Painfully slow service (I think we waited 30 minutes for our second drink order) and had to asked to move seats after being stuck out in the cold! The hostess told us we couldn’t move once seated but the waiter kindly moved us. Over priced for what it is - won’t be in a hurry to return. ',\n"," 'Wow blown away by this place. delicious food, amazing cocktails and fabulous service. Very impressed that our waitress picked up on the fact it was my birthday and brought out a delicious desert with a candle. Great atmosphere, spectacular views, thoroughly recommended!

The food was really lovely and drinks delicious.',\n"," 'Me and my boyfriend booked a table for a dinner, special occasion was my birthday.  Have to admit- whoever there a reception manager have to train they staff how to treat guests and make they evening special. Rude,unpolite and so cold . I am a reception manager in one of fine dinning restaurant in Mayfair. If my staff would treat this way guests- fired same minute. Upon arrival straight away no at least hello- you got table for 1.5 hours. OK...then hostess took us right in the middle of the restaurant where all people passing by. I saw many empty tables- I did ask if we can be moved,she answered no this tables all for bigger groups despite that there where 3 empty tables for 2. Ok... after 20 min someone came to take an order... while we were waiting for a drinks (£18 for a double gin and lemonade) she filled all tables even this table as she claimed for bigger group with 2 people. Ok... finally our starters arrived,in the middle of having snacks, we decide to order 1 more drink and left both plates with half of food, lady approached our table and collected both plates with food in there. We were shocked.. anyways we left after 1 hour being there with no good bye and without Birthday wishes as we do. I am so disappointed, Birthday happens ones a year. Will never go back !!! ',\n"," 'We came all the way from Leeds after seeing this place on social media and it did not disappoint. We came for breakfast and ordered a selection of things. Avocado on toast, Omelettes and Pancakes. The food was amazing and did not take long to arrive. To top it off the views from this place are insane and the atmosphere is excellent. The staff were very accommodating and the women at the reception area were lovely and made us feel very comfortable and were very welcoming. I will defo be coming next time I am in London. Great place for a special occasion.',\n"," 'We have just returned from a fabulous weekend stay at ME London and one of the main reasons we chose this hotel was because of the wonderful Radio Rooftop Bar. We are frequent visitors to the bar and have always found the staff to be extremely courteous and friendly. This weekend was no exception, the service was great. The manager, Emmeric, is always a welcoming face and he goes the extra mile to make the experience a memorable one. We have always been given the choice on whether we would like to be seated inside or out and the staff have never grumbled when we change our minds with the weather conditions! The views are truly spectacular and when we are meeting up with friends from overseas we always take them to Radio as there is no better way of seeing the iconic sights of London (whilst sipping on a cocktail and eating the awesome triple cooked Parmesan chips!) It has got a really cool vibe and at night the atmosphere is buzzing. Winter and summer this continues to be one of our favourite places in London. ',\n"," 'It’s a shame as despite of the great cocktails with one of the best views bar In London has disappointed us on our date with a very unfriendly service. The lady who served us outside gave us the “look” everytime we asked for a new order and ended our night snapping to us to pay the bill and leave. Not recommending to return if you won’t want to ruin your date!',\n"," 'Very rude staff and makes you question what the £20 service charge was actually for and what you pay a premium.  Would not go back.',\n"," 'Won’t not come back here at all. Really rude staff spoils the whole experience also ridiculously overpriced!  Nice views but honestly not worth it.',\n"," 'Stunning views but the cocktails are a bit hit and miss and somewhat overpriced, the food is fine. It is worth a visit for the view but don’t expect to be too impressed by the food or cocktails. ',\n"," 'Very slow service today, we booked 2 tables of six. Our final round took so long to come that the bar staff cancelled it and told us they didn’t have enough time to serve. Needless to say we weren’t spending light',\n"," 'Decided to take my boyfriend here last weekend for a special occasion date night because it seemed to be one of London’s seriously hyped cocktail bars and we wanted a ‘rooftop’ experience. I was mainly interested in coming for cocktails but since they do food I thought I’d book a table for 7:30pm so that we could eat first and then stay on for some drinks after. I did not read the small print in my booking confirmation that tables are only reserved for one and a half hours. I do accept my fault in overlooking this. However I have never experienced a restaurant/bar venue that does not allow customers to stay on for drinks after dining there. It did not occur to me that I’d need to make two separate reservations in order to prevent being kicked out so I didn’t think to do this. So we turned up at 7:30 with just the one reservation. When they reminded us on our arrival that we only had the table for 90 mins I started to worry that we would indeed be kicked out after the meal and not able to stay on for drinks. So once we were seated I went back to the hostess’ desk and asked her if we could stay for drinks since we were already dining. She rudely and brusquely responded ‘We are fully booked’. No apology, no nothing. Now, I’m not expecting them to conjure a table for us out of thin air if they really are fully booked BUT I was shocked at her rudeness and she could have been a great deal more sympathetic and hospitable about it. Also, since we noticed tables were often empty for periods of time between bookings, I really think she could have tried to have been more accommodating if she wanted to, eg. seeing if there was a table we could have for just 45 mins. This is the sort of hospitality that I always would expect to experience at any ‘high end’ establishments like this. The hostess’ rudeness shocked me so much that I returned to my table in tears and proceeded to cry silently for the next few minutes. Our food was really bad. The calamari appetiser was very good but the steak which I ordered was one of the worst I’ve ever eaten: chewy with revolting chips. And very expensive too. When the waiter asked why I hadn’t really eaten it and I told him I found it too chewy he didn’t apologise. Once we finished dinner we were then asked to leave before the next booking arrived. All in all this place is overhyped, overpriced and rude, completely capitalising on their rooftop view (which by the way, wasn’t even as advertised. They covered our section of the restaurant with a dingy grey roof cover, with just a small window left to even see the view. Not at all like the ‘open air’ PR photos). I wish that all the bad reviews on sites like Tripadvisor would actually have some effect and force this place to improve on how they run things. But sadly there will always be a steady stream of tourists and influencers queuing up to get their Instagram photos there, and so Radio Rooftop has little incentive to even care about their miserable ripped off customers. ',\n"," 'Before you decide not to go ask yourself what you are going for. We went for a couples meal. Wrong. The rooftop terrace is stunning and the clientele was decidedly younger. The first thing you meet on arrival (its a hotel) is a bouncer - not a good start. The music is loud so be warned. The menu is limited - sea bass, steak, macaroni cheese and a salad - 4 items. That’s it!  And the food is overcooked. Rubber calamari. The sea bass actually burnt my mouth! I think it’s 3 minutes skin side down and 1 minute flipped over. How do you get it that hot? Finally, the wine is exorbitant. Pinot, Sauvignon and Albariño £56/bottle for tame wine. Certainly not the finest. And finally, finally (honest) they “forgot” to take off the Government discount. Not going back.  But, if you are a young gun who wants expensive cocktails and music maybe it’s for you. ',\n"," 'Group of 12 for celebrations, due to COVID we required 2 tables of 6 to abide by social distancing guidelines but when we booked we asked for them to be close by, that was completely ignored and they placed us two different ends of the roof. On arrival we asked if we could be moved nearer as we couldn’t even see the others and this was completely ignored. The service was awful, at one point it took 45 minutes for the drinks to come and on another occasion we had to go and track our waiter down as we were sitting there with no drinks. We were told no shorts earlier in the week when we enquired about dress code via email, the email response we received was rude and snobbish reminding us it’s a 5 star luxury hotel. We got there in the 34 degree heat in jeans only to find 70% of male guests had shorts on. I have been to much better venues and roof gardens, great views. Terrible service, and poor attitudes!  Not a 5 star experience at all!',\n"," 'Worst food and service I have ever experienced! cocktails were hit and miss and over priced. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. There are plenty of good cocktails bars in London with a good view, good food and friendly staff. This is NOT one of them. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.',\n"," 'Hotel is lovely, staff were very friendly, the view is nice but you can get a better view elsewhere. Although I know its an expensive area and the view is lovely, the cost of the drinks simply isnt worth it for what you get. £20 gets you a small cocktail, whilst it was presented very nicely and tasted great, for £20 I would want it to be a little bit bigger.  We had the calamari and chicken satay just as a little snack, again expensive but tasted nice. Would I come back here? No, Ive seen it and done it now and believe there are better places to go. Would I recommend this place? No, again I think there are better places to go in London.  Social Distancing measures were very good, all staff wore masks and it is expected that you wear a mask when walking through the hotel and lift up to the bar.',\n"," 'Choose the Radio Rooftop bar as part of our first day outing after 4 months of staying home due to London lockdown. We planned a day in London seeing some sights and was really looking forward to a lovely meal on the rooftop over looking London to finish our day before heading home. We had made telephone booking for 5 people at 4pm a few weeks back as I know this place is popular. We had our 15 and 18 year old sons with us. We arrived at 4pm only to be told they have a over 21 only policy after 5pm. We stayed for a drink and snack before heading back out to North London to support a local restaurant instead. Very disappointed this was not explained on the phone. I would assume if we make a booking for 4pm for dinner the person making the booking should check the age or explain their policy just incase. Even the person on entry to the venue was a bit rude and just said \"well thats our policy\" when I ask for an explanation. I have looked at their website and it is stated on the bottom of their home page in small print. But I never looked there so overall only a 3 and that\\'s for the waiter and the view. Everything else was a litte over priced and average. Ended up we had a lovely meal for half the price in our local area.',\n"," 'Avoid, avoid, avoid. Made a booking online and when we arrived we were told that we had to sit inside. Who goes to a rooftop bar to sit inside? When asked if we could sit outside staff were rude and obnoxious even though there were free tables which they said were first come first serve. Also their website implies if you make a booking you’ll be seated outside, which is misleading and not the case if you’re a party of 4 or less. There’s so many great places to go in London, and this isn’t one of them. ',\n"," 'Richard; my guy, best waiter about; anything you need, sorted. Top night. Great service. Great views',\n"," 'Booked a table three days in advance to sit outside. They made me and my husband sit inside with a lame excuse.

The drinks are amazing, the food? Have to say: it is nice, but if you very hungry it is not a place to go. But for chill out and have some drinks do not think twice. ',\n"," 'Visited Radio on an evening during a city break and can honestly say one of the most expensive places I have ever visited (having travelled and lived in several countries).

My cocktail cost £18 and it was served in basically a mug and tasted like squash, we were then charged nearly £5 on top for poor service, the bar server was unfriendly.

One thing to note though is that looking out to the views won't be as good as in the summer given the plastic style windows. This is a contained space so dont expect blankets and cold air in your face.  Overall, good service and cocktails but it didn`t feel particularly special despite the views. One for summertime. \",\n"," \"I was greeted by a lovely man at the main entrance who was so kind .I wish he was my waiter .He was so welcoming. I was so convinced that my experience will be amazing. However upon reaching upstairs to the restaurant itself, I was so disappointed. I wanted to actually leave but we travelled far so we were obligated to stay. I was sat by a lady who handed me two menus (brunch menu and a la carte menu)...  Next thing I know another waiter came and demanded for my bank card. I asked him why as i already gave my bank details upon booking over the phone. He was so rude and told me its the policy and that I should know this. No one told me this when i booked it but i still gave him my card . He came again to take our drink order and i told him im not feeling well as i have flu, and if he could tell the bartender to put less ice in my drink. Again he was rude and said it always comes with ice . I've been to several rooftops in London and never experience such lack of hospitality . Upon having received our drinks we ordered our food with him and he said we could only order from the brunch menu .I asked him why as the lady who sat me down gave me two menus. I then asked him if the steak is beef or pork as i dont eat pork. He looked at me like I know nothing and said of course it's beef. After that another waiter took over as i think the other one had finished his shift. However even if it was towards the end of his shift, he shouldn't be this rude.\",\n"," 'Visited Radio bar for a cocktail, on reaching the 10th floor the staff member waiting was so cold and miserable with no eye contact that I wanted to turn round and leave. Cocktails were ok , but wouldn’t return as bar was soulless with staff obviously not happy to be working there. It’s a real shame as this venue could be amazing if it had the correct management.',\n"," 'Popped in for a quick drink after dinner nearby. Lovely space with very attentive staff. Would be cheaper to go to the local pub BUT definitely not the same views!  Would love to come back for food.',\n"," 'Went for dinner , food was ok ... very limited menu and prob wouldn’t go back . Great views of the River but not sure it’s worth the price ',\n"," 'We had reserved in advance - and given credit card details in case of no show. Initial impressions not good as we were shown to the ‘outdoor’ bar to a coffee table / sofa which didn’t look ideal for dinner - then we were shown to an equivalent inside and then in a light bulb moment we were offered a table in the main dining area! Menu is limited but quality was good. Alpine sharing board followed a generous portion of salmon. Food good. Also cocktails but £17 is expensive. Enjoyed the view (Shard to London Eye) and the food but unlikely to rush back',\n"," 'Interesting choice and getting in is fun as clearly it is the place to be --not! Ok inside but views in the evening are poor as the plastic outer balcony window covers severely impact the clarity. Was kept inside even though clearly there was room outside on the terrace. House red (OK) , cocktail (v good) and house champagne with 12.5% so called discretionary came to c £50--hmmmm. Probably great for summer. Waiting staff and bouncers downstairs were fine -- felt honoured we were not asked for our credit card upfront which seems to be a sort of policy--makes you wonder why.... ',\n"," 'Nice staff, working hard, but this place is for tourists. The view South and East across to the city is great but the other compass points are pretty ordinary.  Two cocktails, £17 quid each on the menu, with service charge the bill was £36. Food on menu looked ordinary but expensive. There are better places to eat, drink and see London',\n"," 'we went for a drink with my friends and we found the place incredible with good views and good service, especially samantha was really frienly  Thanks',\n"," 'My sister and I recently visited this bar. We quite enjoyed it, our servers name was Zsolt (hope I spelt that correctly) He was excellent, extremely polite and his customer service was outstanding.  However we did make a reservation and they put us to share a couch with another table which I found to be very uncomfortable. I asked the lady who seated us if there was anything else available and she said no but I felt an attitude with her answer which made me feel very uncomfortable. Later on in the night we were finishing our bottle of red wine when another waitress came up to us and said our time is up and we have to leave soon because someone else needed our seat. (How rude and unprofessional) She then realized that the couple that was sharing the couch/table with us was in fact not with us and they were here much longer than we were and I’m assuming that message was for them and not for my sister and I.

We did not have a reservation, however the hostess at the entrance (could not get her name unfortunately) was quite accommodating and quicky found a table for us. We had a lovely glass of champagne each and delicious cocktails. One of the managers: German, offered us some great bites which were perfectly matching the cocktails which we choose beforehand.  Overall great experience. Looking forward to come back. ',\n"," 'Had a great time, Samantha Buisson was a lovely host - Made us feel like home. Wonderful rooftop view overseeing London.',\n"," 'As this is one of our favourite places in London, we do frequent Radio often enough, although this evening merits a special mention.  Firstly, the lovely Finnish lady (Sala?) by the lifts always greets us with a the most warm welcome that it already makes you feel like you’re coming “home”. It was just the third time that I met her but she already remembered and greeted me by name before I even mention my booking - this is hospitality in its perfection.  When we arrived at Radio, we didn’t even say who we are, we simply were shown to our table-with-a-view. Nothing better than a seamless entry!  As a creature of habit, we ended up ordering the same food: the edamame was more tasty though and so were the deliciously creamy croquets! And there’s nothing better than to finish with the divinely addictive churros.  Our waiters, Zsolt and Richardo, could not have looked after us any better: Zsolt always served us with a bright smile and recommended us a few other dishes. Richardo, is always as warm and friendly as ever.  But it’s not only the waiters that looked after us all night - the management team also cared for us to no end. Fabio always comes over to greet us and have a chat with us even in the busiest period. Gleb always insist that he is at our disposal should we wish to request anything.  It is truly the people that make a place worth coming back again and again for. Ever since my friends and I came here for the first time at the end of March and certainly since the summer party, we’ve been coming at least every month! I sincerely want to thank the entire team (Fabio, German, Gleb, Antoine, Angelo, Richardo, Samantha, Sala) for always being so welcoming and for your generosity and hospitality - and for making Radio feel like a second home. Wishing you a most wonderful Christmas and a prosperous New Year 2020! x',\n"," 'I came last Monday night to enjoy my free time in Radio and I’ve been satisfied as usual inasmuch the location is amazing (one of my favorite in London) and service was amazing too. My friend and I had a bottle of Rioja Sierra Cantabria (well recommended) and on top of this Lorena’s service was brilliant! She has been very helpful and friendly with us through the night and when we’ve got the second bottle, this one was tasting different comparing with the first one(it can happen anywhere with any type of wine),so she took care of us and this gesture made us happier even more than we already were! I’ll definitely be back as soon as I can!',\n"," \"We didn't eat here but we did stay at the Me hotel so we used this bar twice for drinks with friends, its fantastic really modern staff are friendly and they have a great range of drinks, The balcony is also lovely you can sit outside as they cover the area so its not cold.

When we arrived the waiter asked us for one of our visa card so that we wouldn’t leave without paying?! I felt extremely uncomfortable, as I’ve never had to give my card to secure a payment! For their peace of mind I asked them for my card back and pre paid for my food that I ordered. When I asked to pay for my order (so I could have my card back), the waiter was very passive aggressive, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed which stopped me from enjoying myself!  She then offered me a drink to compensate the embarrassment that I had to go through (to me this act showed that she agreed that she was in the wrong). Also to ensure that I was being discriminated, I asked the table next to us if they had a hotel booked with them and if not did they had to give their card in. Their response was that they didn’t give any visa cards and they did not have a hotel booked with them either. This was the first time I’ve been discriminated, and it completely ruin my evening! I’m writing this review to prevent this happening to someone else, as it was a very upsetting experience have been apart of.',\n"," 'First time to the Radio rooftop bar, nice setting, good drinks selection although pricey and what out for the peanuts as they are extremely expensive at £5 and we were not advised when asking for complimentary nuts!

Allergies not catered for even though we requested no Egg or alcohol as my daughter is pregnant. Served us egg sandwiches and desserts with gin and tequila in them. Cheese and Ham sandwiches contained no cheese. Stale scones, stale rubbery bread.Hairs found in sandwiches, cups and tea pot was rusty. Served us hot frothy milk with tea?, no spoons to eat creme brûlée or truffle. Visited the bathroom which had vomit over the loo seats. 5 of us in total and I refused to pay for all of us as it was inedible. Manager said he’d take off the discretionary service charge so informed him it was discretionary and having waited 45 minutes for hairy sandwiches, weak tea with frothy milk I wasn’t paying that either. He then asked what would I like to pay for out if the £210 bill I said no more than £100 he said fine if that’s ok so I knocked off more money and decided I was only paying for our drinks, watch out if you go here and have allergies, pregnancy or intolerances they may just kill you.

During clear weather conditions, it's a lovely backdrop (which pushed my rating to very good) especially for those not based in the UK or London. Later in the afternoon, it will be too loud for this but nice for after-work drinks and letting your hair down. Customer service can fluctuate and while the staff is polite for the most part, the balance of being attentive without being overbearing vs lacking attentiveness isn't always present. Some employees are pushy about leaving credit cards behind which didn't use to be the case and others seem fine with taking cash payment when leaving. I have experienced this more so over the last 2 years.\",\n"," 'Amazing place with amazing view ! One of the best rooftop in London !  Samantha was really nice and smiling !

This time we were very well looked after by the lovely Roberto: not long after we sat at the sofas he came to take our drinks order; we were never with an empty glass - it was always promptly topped up. The noticeable difference this time though was the taste of the food - every dish we ordered was a lot tastier: shrimps were crispy, edamame was very well seasoned, beef sliders were juicy, cheese platter was simply divine and the chips were oh so delicious (we tend to order the same favourite dishes!).  Fabio, who managed my entire party with perfection the last time, also came over to say hello to us. It is the hospitality and the warm service that makes us come back again and again - Now that the food has much improved we will surely not stay away for too long.

See you soon Radio!!',\n"," \"We had a very lovely first experience on a Friday night at Radio Rooftop. This was largely thanks to the wonderful hospitality of firstly Theodore, who took time to talk to us about the venue, and take us out to the balcony for better photos at his kind suggestion. Secondly but not least importantly, the waiters in our area, especially Roberto and the lovely lady who was with him (small with short brown hair- apologies, I didn't get her name). These 3 people were very very lovely, had great people skills, and made the night for us! We very much enjoyed the food which was served promptly (steak and the cod for mains) and the young male waiters who brought it out were very sweet. The place smells amazing, has an aura of a club initially, but the restaurant area is lovely. I would recommend asking to be sat overlooking Somerset House which is the nicer side. Thank you to the above mentioned who made this a beautiful evening- we will be back!\",\n"," 'Great environment, fun place to hangout after work or weekends. Bar service can be a bit slow when busy.

Greated with a frown on entry as we wanted food with drinks we sat next to a table high in life, or something similar and introduced to our waiter. Don\\'t expect the usual greeting, no no no, this place is special first words are \"Can I take your credit card\" (yes take it away until you leave). Don\\'t worry this is standard practice in any high end establishment, it promotes trust with the customer. We did have to wait longer than expected for the food but that was fine as they gave us a bowl of nuts to keep us going.

Unlikely I was going to do a runner as I was sat for dinner for goodness sake. Waiter was embarrassed to ask for this I think. Food was very average and presented in a manner that you would expect in your local cafe, not in a London restaurant that thinks it's providing exclusivity. You pay for the view, nothing else. Also was told I couldn't have coffee as they needed the table back (I had been sitting for 2 hours). I laughed and told them I would have my coffee at the end of my meal right where I was sitting.

This place is great. The view is really nice and the food is great. Nice selections for dinner and tons of drink and wine options. You should definitely make reservations because this place is very popular in the evenings and gets crowded. There are tables both inside and out. Tip: Check out the amazing hotel reception area downstairs when you leave. The lobby is a huge pyramid shaped atrium reaching all the way up to the restaurant. They have an incredible music and graphic light show that is projected onto the walls of the lobby. I've never seen a cooler hotel reception area anywhere in the world!

It was late morning, food wouldn't be available until noon, which didn't worry us, and we were shown to a table with relacing sofas and great views out across the Strand and this part of London. We had a very enjoyable coffee and wine, relaxing in the sunshine and, while the bill was a little expensive it was less than you might expect from such a splendid location. \",\n"," 'So we booked at the last minute and got a table for brunch. The setting is spectacular we could see the London Eye and the Shard without having to leave our table. The staff were lovely and very accommodating. We went for brunch I ordered Eggs Benedict but there Eggs Benedict is actually Eggs Royals also I asked for my eggs soft and they were hard. The eggs were corrected in minutes but unfortunately I still had to have Royale and not Benedict. The rest of the tablet had steaks, burgers and avocado toast and all was good. Desserts we should have skipped they were. Little heavy for brunch.

We had one drink and had to go and track someone down to order another. Then we had bouncers arrive while we were finishing our drinks to chuck everyone out despite being residents. It was only 11pm.

Eventually got outside and nobody bothered to take our food or drinks order just kept walking past as if we weren’t there I had to ask 3 times and then someone finally took our order. THEN they took another 20 minutes to try and find the wine we ordered, our food arrived before our drinks!!!!

After waiting an unusually long time to be served, the food arrived a short while later, with half of it wrong, and some of it never arriving at all despite us prompting the waiter several times. Coffees were served with no sugar or milk, we asked for this but by the time it was brought the drinks had either already been drunk or were cold. The staff included charges on the bill for items that were supposed to already be included, and didn't offer any apology whatsoever for the poor level of service (in fact they seemed quite oblivious). The food was average, and based on the service levels we received I'd say quite overpriced.

He was dismissive when I asked for a jug of water with our drinks and looked at me as though I was thick, no- one checked on us, did we want anything else, we did but after half hour decided to leave, as no-one interested. On paying the bill we were charged for good service which we were not willing to pay given our unfriendly, uncaring, holier than thou waiter service and we were again challenged, we explained and told that's ok, but the mannerisms displayed verged on agressive.

A friend and I wanted some food, the waiter told us that he would be back... another 25 minutes later after asking a variety of staff we were then able to order. At 22:50 when we were mid eating (because it took so long to order) we were told that outside was closing. I explained that that was fine, however it would be nice if we could finish our food first. The waitress appeared quite arrogant and just walked away.  We were then moved to another area, which was fine but we were sat there for 2 1/2 hours we did not receive any table service and even though I requested to order drinks from waitresses they were very rude, unhelpful and not interested in assisting us. Therefore I had to walk and order at the bar... luckily the bar men and kitchen staff were great.  On paying nearly £250, I asked if it would be ok if the waiter could possibly take a photo of us with the comment of ‘sorry I have too much to do’ on this we just got up and left. He then commented that it would be fine but the approach and hospitality of this bar is appalling. All 5 of us will not be visiting again... the view is lovely but there was also no vibe and with such horrible staff there are a million better bars to enjoy such as Aqua bar.',\n"," 'My husband and I were staying in the hotel to celebrate our 20th Wedding Anniversary and spent the evening in the bar drinking cocktails and enjoying the view. It was lovely to sit outside on the comfortable sofas, drink delicious cocktails and take in the sights and sounds of London We had breakfast here the following morning too and it was the best breakfast I’ve had in a long time.  Thank you for making our anniversary so special. We will be back. ',\n"," \"I met my friend for drinks. We chose this place because it looked fantastic online. And it does not disappoint. From the walk through the lobby, to the lift going up and then the bar itself. It's all very stylish and very cool. We were shown to a lovely seating area on the roof top with a great view of the City. I was really pleased that we were able to take my son with us (until 5pm). We had a bottle of wine and some fries.  We did wait a fair while to order but the weather and atmosphere helped with the wait. My only critisism is that they added a service charge on to our bill. I expect that for large groups but not 3 adults and a child. That said - the staff were very friendly and helpful. We would have left a tip anyway - I just don't like the assumption of it being added to the bill.\",\n"," \"A group of us decided to go here for some after-work drinks on a Thursday evening. Only 2-3 people in the queue upon arrival, however we were immediately told on the door they were 'fully booked'. There was no offer of a wait time, and my friend even asked if there was space to sit/stand the bar, to which there apparently was not.  A kind group of people who were waiting next to us in the queue offered us space at their (pre-booked) table, to which we accepted. When we got up there it was practically empty, and didn't exactly fill up throughout the evening, so the door staff had clearly lied.  All I have to say is by the looks of these reviews this kind of appalling service isn't a one-off, so this place seriously needs to consider their staff's treatment of customers in order to up their game. This place already seems to have a reputation for being pretentious, don't add to it by driving everyone away who is willing to come here and spend money.\",\n"," 'I was pleased with the lay out of the bar and the general design, the views weren’t the best London has to offer but rooftop bars are a rarity and makes this place a little unique. But the staff...it was like walking into a KFC, no smiles, no greeting, clueless and bored looking staff. The waiter we had looked particularly bored and emotionless, the drinks took a while and the requested water took a few reminders and about 30 mins before arriving. No napkin with the drinks either. With high-end prices they really need to improve their service and get staff that don’t come across like they have been recruited from a greasy spoon.',\n"," 'Received snacks same time as main course only to be lied to and told it was a side dish. Couscous with the sea bass was cold, broccoli lifeless and the portion so miserly and miserably presented it makes you feel sad.',\n"," 'I had the pleasure of being taken to lunch here for my Grandsons 21st Birthday Celebration. I wasn’t very happy that I had to travel to London but it was well worth the journey. The setting is absolutely gorgeous I loved the fact that you could sit having lunch and look out all over London it was amazing. I chose the Chicken Club Sandwich it was tasty and well presented. My Grandson chose a steak and he said it was really nice and cooked well. I don’t know if I will get the chance again but if I have to go up to London in the future I will definitely pay this place another visit.',\n"," 'Reserved a table for a works leaving drink, as wanted somewhere to remember, but unfortunately our table was inside...

Arrived at the entry desk, enquired if we could just have drinks and told yes, but for an hour only !  At the prices, half an hour was enough.  A gin with mixer and vodka with mixer was £32, and the bill had the “discretionary” 12.5% service charge. If they were doubles the volume of ice meant there was little taste of alcohol.  View ! See below not very scenic ',\n"," 'My friend had reserved a table for 10:30 last night. The meal at stk ran later but the lady at the lifts was rude about how we can now not go to radio roof top. No compassion for 10 mins late due to meal or the fact that we came for a special milestone birthday. She even suggested whether or not we still would want to go up given it’s only a room behind the booth as if she just didn’t want to let us in. Fortunately the manager was much more understanding. We were then given a table behind the d j booth and service was slow. Positive would be the managers understanding and the churros off the dessert menu. Could have been a very good experience. Service is key.',\n"," 'Booked the venue months in advance. The reservation team could not have been more helpful. I had phoned to ask whether I could sample/taste the canapés first before doing the preorder and Francesca booked it without hassle. Me and my two friends (who both stayed with me at the Suite ME on the party night itself) went for a tasting session two weeks before the party!  I big thank you to the Manager: Fabio Dal Bosco who looked after us from the moment we did the tasting. When a dish was not quite to our liking, he listened to what we would have liked instead and came up with another dish that was just perfect. Then, me being fussy, asked for a special welcoming cocktail to be made, one that combines two of my favourite drinks: gin and champagne. Fabio came up with 3 different cocktails that were all to die for. We chose 2 and on the night, 160 of these delicious cocktails were consumed, even by guests who normally do not drink cocktails - testimony of how good they were!  We got our own special staff Angelo for the night who no doubt looked after us throughout the evening. Everything and I mean everything went smoothly. Fabio stayed above and beyond his hours, made sure the handover was smooth and even helped to ensure the living room was cleared and cleaned before he left. It transpires he even helped me friends with the whole surprise birthday cake. No guest was running out of drinks and yet no one was excessively drinking either - the team controlled the pace in such a beautiful way that I have never experienced. The food was divine. The venue is simply stunning. The compliments from my guests were endless and still came in a week after the party ended - such was the unforgettable night.  As a host I was able to spend my time with my honourable guests and this was only possible because Fabio and his team made sure the rest was taken care of.  Thank you so much for such a perfect and memorable birthday Radio team - it could not have been any better! ',\n"," 'Abysmal service. After three attempts at asking for a second round of drinks we gave up and got the bit after waiting 30 minutes. Food distinctly average or below.  Hard to believe reading the reviews that no one can turn the service around, there’s clearly a problem. Sack the manager and get in someone with at least half a clue how to manage a ‘restaurant’. Oh, and don’t worry about the ‘dress code’. Trainers and ripped jeans a plenty. Better food and service in a local Wetherspoons.',\n"," 'After checking in at the hotel downstairs we popped up to the rooftop bar for some apps and drinks, expecting a sophisticated evening with great views; instead finding we’d inadvertently stumbled into some ghastly nightclub. Thumping techno music made it impossible to think. Staff - clad in bizarre ugly jumpsuits - were inattentive and rude. Service was slow. Food was greasy and unseasoned. Two gin and tonics set us back more than £30. Patrons were pushy, loud and drunk. The worst of it was that we couldn’t get the hell out of there - despite using our keycard, the elevators (packed with screaming drunk 20-somethings) ran express to the ground and back up to the bar again with no opportunity for us to get off at our floor and retreat to our room. Although I’m sure breakfast up there in the morning would have been beautiful, we weren’t prepared to risk getting stuck up there again. We won’t be coming back - to the bar or the hotel. ',\n"," 'Visited with my friend for a drink to catch up, the service as soon as we arrived was terrible. Staff didn’t acknowledge we were there, ignored us at the bar and stated that we couldn’t sit outside on the outdoor seating of the roof bar, even though there were many tables empty and clearly not occupied.  Further to this, we asked for a drink and had to repeat it to the bartender several times as he didn’t know what it was (the only white wine served by the glass). We finally received our drinks after we had being stood waiting for a while, many bartenders were stood chatting and not acknowledging the two of us here. We received our bill with a discretionary service charge which we made sure we would not be paying an extra pence!  They’re should be measures put into for the retraining of staff, as we will not be back and we will be sure to make those that are close to us to avoid wasting their time and spending money here, there are much nicer places to go for a drink where they treat their guest and customers with respect and poiliteness.',\n"," 'Invited there for lunch by a client. How embarrassing, for both of us. Dreadful service and food which was significantly overpriced, even if it had been ok. I had the Katsu chicken ceasar salad. The best use of the chicken would have been to resole my shoes; the salad was small, with almost no dresssing. A request for some bread to add a bit of bulk to lunch resulted in an attempt to charge £4.50 for two bits of dry toast, without butter. My client had a steak, which was far below the standard you would expect. Absolutely dreadful, so keep away. Including two soft drinks, £92. I very rarely post critical reviews, but this lot need to sit up, get their act in gear and stop fleecing those who make the mistake to come.',\n"," 'Visited last Saturday - found the front of house staff extremely rude, we were given a rubbish table inside when we’d been told in advance we’d be able to sit outside, poor food, poor and very slow service (took over an hour to get our food and only offered 1 drink) and finally only just after we’d finished our food were we confronted by another rude staff member who pretty much asked us to leave as they needed our table for another group. Can honestly say it’s the worst restaurant Experience i’ve had in London! Will not be returning nor recommending to anyone else!',\n"," \"I had the pleasure to visit the Radio Rooftop on Saturday for afternoon tea. I ordered the afternoon team with bottomless. 2 days prior to the reservation, i received an email stating there will be no longer serving bottomless.  Upon arrival, staff were tentative and showed us to our table. Had to wait 10 minutes for a a waitress to come and give us a menu. Despite the fact we had an 1.5 hour limit.  The Scones and cakes were delightful but there was no tea. Conscious of time as we had other engagements and the tea had still not arrived after an hour. How are you advertising afternoon tea without tea? then have the audacity to add service charge. Have contacted them twice and no response! Overpriced with girls taking pictures for their Instagram. Wouldn't recommened\",\n"," \"We were thoroughly disappointed with our trip to the radio rooftop. The email said dress was smart, which we did - but others were in ripped jeans, trainers and t-shirt. What is the point of having a dress-code then not applying it? We were sat at a table with no view - the whole point of going to the rooftop bar for us was to have a nice (birthday) meal with a good view over London. We didn't get that at all. We were sat on a deep sofa with a low (knee high) table. This made it hard to eat comfortably. We were overlooked by the waiters. Other couples/groups were asked several times throughout our short time how they were but the waiters seemed to ignore us unless we managed to catch their eye. We ordered the Mexican sharing platter which was very expensive (as were all the meals). Due to the expense we were expecting more than a bag of cheap brand Doritos that had not been heated nor had any cheese as the nachos, but that is what we got (we asked for no jalapenos). The dips were nothing special, nor the quesadillas. The platter also had 4 chicken skewers (2 of good size, the other two very small pieces of chicken) and then tons of pepper things (I am assuming these are very cheap). All in all, I would expect to pay no more than £5 for something of this size and quality at a restaurant (especially as I could probably 'make' the nachos from a 50 p bag of crisps) - not the £27 that it unfathomably cost. We were still hungry after this plate but decided to cut our losses and find somewhere else to finish our meal. We asked for the bill and to add insult to injury a service tip had been applied. Summary: Well over-priced, poor quality food and service (though others may have gotten better service), poor seating arrangements. Very disappointing.\",\n"," \"Lovely views, nice drinks (when you eventually get them) but rude staff and no atmosphere.  Ordered a G&T and had to chase it up 3 times.... 25 mins later it arrived!  Ordered two cheeseburgers (as we were told we couldn't order from the normal menu... after handing us the normal menu on arrival) they took an HOUR to come ... an hour for two cheeseburgers ....!  Also ordered nuts and olives to have with our drinks while we were waiting for our food and they came AFTER our main food had came out. When I chased up our drinks/food with staff all I got was eye rolls and 'ok i'll see where it is' no apology or urgency - the staff clearly didn't want to be there!  No atmosphere just dull, overpriced and rude!\",\n"," 'We visited rooftop last night ,  Absolutely amazing from beginning to end !!  I want to specifically think Michael barbota our waiter he could not have been any better  We loved the food ordered we had the Shariing platters highly recommended  Will definitely come back  Very very soon',\n"," \"Let's start with the negative because there are big positives to end on ... 1) You may struggle to get in! There's a lift and when there is security on the door you may not be lucky enough to get through lol! They appear very discerning as to their clientele ... but maybe that's a good thing. 2) It is pricey. But then it's London, it's a great bar & restaurant and the view ... well, we'll come back to that later. 3) Service isn't great. But then we weren't spending big like some of the other parties there - and that's just how these expensive bars work I guess - and we did get served ok in the end. We were rather bluntly told a couple of times by a hostess to move as the area we were in was reserved, but the final time it happened the hostess was charming and we forgave them! Now the positives: 1)Wow! What a view! You get a 290 degree view across one of the most impressive cities in the world, and if you stay long enough for this to turn from day to night you will never forget it! 2) Although pricey, the food was great. We had a sharing platter and it was really tasty. 3) You do get the feeling you are mixing with rather wealthy people (not least because some of the groups there did appear to be a little pretentious) and that makes you feel a bit more up market, a bit more special. Overall my assessment is this: the view is worth it, it is expensive but exclusive, it is pretentious but classy and you will seriously impress the pants off any date you take there!\",\n"," 'Whilst at a great location with cool views, service and attitude is terrible.

When we arrived at the ME London Hotel there was a queue to get up to the rooftop but once we told them we had a reservation we were straight up. Managed to get a table on the terrace - initial table was wedged in between two other tables so we moved to a comfy sofa which was great.  There is a minimum spend of £50/head but with a bottle of wine plus cocktails you will be through this. Staff were attentive and polite and we had a nice chilling time having something to eat, drink, listening to the music and enjoying the view. If you enjoy people watching there are also some sights to behold! We had lobster sandwich (£25) and flat iron steak (£19) both tasty but small portions for price - see photos. Got caught out by leaving a tip on bill but realising (after the event) that service is already added - makes for a good tip!!

The host led us to the table and advised she would send the waiter with the menu that arrived 15 minutes later wondering if we would seat down by ourselves or someone from the staff would escort us. Clearly he had no idea we were there! Finally we ordered drinks and when our friends turned up it took another 15 minutes for them to order and get their drinks.  We ordered two sharing boards - the mexican and indian - for 4 of us, but some of the dishes were only suitable for 3.  The mexican sharing board came with nachos easily purchasable in Tesco! Very poor food quality.  Finally we asked for the bill which we receive it quite soon.  We asked some time to arrange the payment and waiter never came back to collect it. We actually had to stand up and walk through the till in order to pay. Or we could have just left without paying literally!

Who is running this place? Shame on you. Whilst the rooftop views are stunning, that it is not enough.... your staff are rude, your tables are dirty, including (on our reserved table) a miserable filthy ashtray. I would definitley not eat here. Your DJ blasts lunchtime music at levels to ensure that all possibility of easy conversation is destroyed. Your customer terms and conditions are laughable when you offer such a poor service at all levels.Thankfully we knew within minutes to leave (not that any of your staff showed any interest). There are alternative fantastic roof top bars in London. Lunchtime @Radio is disgraceful, unless you are wanting to be clubbing at lunchtime. Interestingly, having now read other similar reviews, even the management @Radio show no courtesy to acknowedge that they are miserably failing. London is fantastic, has great roof top venues for a celebratory lunch. Radio is absolutely not one of them. In my experience Avoid.

You have to book a few weeks in advance but once your here although the table stay are meant to be an hour and a half at the weekend we stayed for seven hours yesterday and managed to move on three different tables ...  Our first table was a small cosy bistro table overlooking theatre-land and beyond . Our beautiful waitress was a student from Peru We ordered two Long Island Teas but too be honest they where a bit weak so I wouldn’t bother , I did mention it to our waitress but she just said sorry . However her recommendation for a Rose wine was perfect yes it was £40 a bottle and we had a couple but what the heck , think it was called Ultimate Provence 2018 .  Food wise at the weekend there is only the brunch menu plenty of choice for everyone , we had the Radio Bar Burger with fries and the lobster sandwich on a brioche bun so very light served with sweet potato fries . Each dish around £20 so not overpriced especially when you take in the surroundings .  So it’s a very smart but casual setting with a mixture of outside and inside seating areas I don’t believe you can reserve tables but just ask when booking . Everything is centred around the huge bar area Where if you just wanted to sit at the bar you can ....  whilst roasting for a few hours we decided to move inside to cool down for a while and found ourselves next to the dj stand .. good music although a bit trancee for me I’m a Luther girl myself ... I then asked another waiter to find us a table on the other side of venue , which he did so now we are outside overlooking the Shard , St Paul’s and the Thames . This is where we hit the Gins and Vodkas and the Olives ... again price wise is always gonna be a bit over the top but worth every penny . Fab venue , excellent location , great food and a great vibe . The staff are extremely helpful .

The third time another member of staff came to our table and was told that the lemon pie did have lemon in it, and the orange cake and biscuit did in fact have orange in them.

Service is terrible and we still paid for the service charge. Once is enough. I would rather go to gong at the shangrila Hotel which is almost similar price point but way better.

Terrible experience and I will definitely not recommend it.',\n"," 'We went early eve for food on the Sunday of the bank holiday weekend at the beginning of the month. Had a great table outside over looking the views ( which are ok). Service was good food average pricey for what we had £170 for cocktails a small plate to share and two mains. What did really spoil the experience was loud v drunk rude customers surrounding us and no attempt by any staff to ask them to be considerate of others. Not a place we would return too- but without the atmosphere being so horrid it was ok.',\n"," 'Really great experience and not as expensive as some other highrise locations in London. Would go back again. ',\n"," 'We booked for a special occasion and I wouldn’t recommend it. The booking process was stressful, we were told we had the table for 2 hours and £75 min spend per person, even if you’re ordering the bottomless brunch. Friends who made group bookings recently were told £50 min, I’m not sure why we were told more.  The food was average and overpriced. Avocado toast was awful. Cocktails were nice but small and nothing special for £15/16 each. On the plus side, our waiter was really attentive.  There’s to rush back for in my opinion, there are roof terraces with nicer views and much better food elsewhere. ',\n"," 'Staff is rude, spoils the views. Food and drinks are average!!!

Duty manager come over... he offered a free glass of wine and fixed the heater also gave a little birthday treat for my friend.Good end result!\",\n"," \"Visited as a party of four to celebrate my Daughter's birthday. Situated on the tenth floor with great views over the embankment and the river. Very well appointed bar area with a spacious and heated roof terrace that we sat on.  The staff were all excellent. They were all friendly attentive and efficient. The cocktails were very good and varied. We all had a main course from the menu. All were OK but not special, however you do not visit this bar for the food.  We visited at lunch time and consequently everyone was relaxed. I'm sure it is a different place at sunset and after dark when the views must be be even better! Will definitely return for a drink, if not the food.\",\n"," '1. Don’t arrive more than 10 minutes late or they will give your table away! We were 10 mins late and our table for 8 was given away and we had to sit outside in the wind and rain until an inside table became available ..approx 45 mins later.  2. Be sure to know the job description of each & every employee ..I was told off (actually shouted at!) for giving my drinks order to a ‘server’ and not the correct person (even though the server was quite happy to take my order).  3. Have a bucket load of patience ..drinks took forever (or never!) to appear ! But when I chased that was my fault as I had asked the server not the drinks waiter ...seriously ?!! ..customer service at its finest !!? 4. Please do enjoy the continuous monotonous beats from the DJ (whilst waiting for your drinks ..that will never appear!). This beat will be the same for your entire evening and will not change (we were there from 6:30-10:30pm). Shoot me now !!!  In a nutshell ..it was such HUGE disappointment !!! It could be soooo good under better management...but it’s such a missed opportunity. The service was chaotic and disorganised. The seating areas were disappointing. The DJ was terrible ..They should be cranking it up and having more tunes people could dance too later on in the evening !!?? Such such a shame as it’s a great spot with fabulous views...but they’ve got it wrong wrong wrong !!  Won’t be coming back !',\n"," '3rd visit to Radio, was pleased that they seem to have new door staff from my last visit , much more approachable and friendly.  I love radio great views cocktails are lovely, and will return but can’t quite understand why after so many reviews pointing out how bad the service is they still haven’t done anything about this?? If you want to charge the prices you need to have a service which matches.  When having a table, your waiting staff should be keeping a eye when drinks are low etc and asking if you would like another.',\n"," 'Decided to try this venue it was really nice, however, it was a little to busy and we where told we have to each spend £50 to be in the venue, so it was a little pricey for what I thought the cocktails to taste like juice, the views where amazing from the outside!',\n"," 'Very good breakfast we had today 2 servers served us they were very friendly and helped me with my needs. One server called Elfe she was very talkative and suggested some attractions to visit in London.

The location is good with plenty of transport options nearby. The views are great across London.  Sadly, there are no other positives. The service was shocking. The staff looked like they were on work experience from school & none of them had a clue about service. We were seated on sofas until our table was ready & when we finally move inside, we had to ask them to bring the champagne & ice buckets over to our table.  The food orders were taken & despite providing details of 10 main courses & starters, only 9 were brought out. No real apology.  The food was at best mediocre. They looked like they’d popped to the nearest McDonald’s for the chips they served. Woeful.  Despite all this, they still charged us a 12.5% service charge!  I’d go there for a drink but wouldn’t consider it for any food or special gatherings. ',\n"," 'Fine for a few drinks, if you don’t mind waiting for service, paying £15 a drink and it being very noisy.  Tables on the outside but are moved very close together so you can hear every conversation. Had to ask waiters 3 times for service rather than them coming up to you. Food was ok. Think small plates rather than big meals. Good for work drinks if work picking up the bill. Terrible for a couples date night ',\n"," \"My boyfriend had booked the table and already mentioned it was my birthday. Arrival was a bit hard to find. The first guy took an order for water and we never saw him again, he looked like a manager - poor form. We waited so long for him to come back but had to ask a server/runner (he was lovely) who looked like the only person working to order everything else. The service was non-existence maybe not enough waiters I'm not sure. Apparently I was supposed to get a birthday plate and a different guy when we were paying asked us to wait but already the service was so slow we had further plans. We didn't pay the 12.5% service charge because there was no consistent service, food was average and it was slow. Generally I don't usually have an issue with service charge either.  Go here if you want basic drinks, and just a normal hangout nothing special and maybe a few people so you don't notice the wait. But if you're celebrating something look elsewhere luckily I had extra plans that made my birthday special.\",\n"," 'The Restaurant is very nice but the best thing was that we got served by a very friendly and professional italian waiter named Michele (Mike) he really made a difference excellent suggestion for our wine and food definitely will recommend the place thanks',\n"," 'I visited with my husband for birthday drinks . We had quite a nice evening until a group of about 10 people were put sitting beside us . There was a reality tv star among them. They were all very drunk and talking openly about what drugs they had taken and were ordering more . One of them grabbed the blanket I was using . I was insulted and called the most appalling names In what became an onslaught of abuse. It was very intimidating to be attacked like this . We asked to move . We were put inside so we didn’t have nice seats anymore or the view which we wanted . I asked for the manager to see what if was going to do about it . Other members of staff had witnessed the attack . He said he could do nothing as they were residents . He did not even speak to the people .We insisted that our bill was discounted but were very disappointed at the uncaring attitude of the manager . I would not recommend anyone go here . It was very intimidating and concerning that they allow people like this into the establishment. I would consider it unsafe .  Very upsetting.  There are much nicer bars in the vicinity. We had been in the American bar at the savoy before this . Was a great spot .',\n"," 'Very nice place for a friends nightout with views of London. I would highly recommend it if you like rooftop bars!!',\n"," 'This place has a nice vibe, very relaxed and super friendly staff. The views are okay but not the best, we sat outside on the roof terrace which was lovely but you can’t see much more than the BT Tower from there. Food is reasonable however a side dish had to be chased and arrived at the end of the meal and drinks took over 15 minutes to come which let the overall experience down. The staff were always hugely apologetic but it would have been a nicer experience if nobody had to apologise in the first place...it wasn’t super busy either so not sure what was going on there?',\n"," 'First time we dined with at Radio Rooftop, in January was amazing with no complaints. Our return today (April) wasn’t as good which was a shame. The service was poor and we almost felt forgotten about.

It was a lovely sunny day and we sat by a great window table with a beautiful view of London. We had the unlimited Bellini’s for an hour and a half which were lovely.

They bought out a complimentary birthday dessert for our friend which was a nice touch. We had a great day and night at Radio Rooftop and would highly recommend this place to others. We loved it!',\n"," 'We gave this place a shot, but it fell short of expectations. The hostess was very accommodating when we asked to sit outside for drinks.(they sat us inside first bit, it was a warm night they finally sat us outside) then they told us that I had to order drinks at the bar while other folks were getting served outside next to us. Food was great, service is sub par and the noise level is too loud to carry any type of conversation. Bar staff was very generous and polite but it took too long for the food to arrive. Would recommend to go someplace else.',\n"," 'Never come across such rude, ill-mannered staff before! It doesn’t matter if you are a popular ‘iconic’ venue when your staff have zero customer service, talk in a patronising manner and speak down their nose at people. Not impressed! Walked in and straight back out again!',\n"," 'This is one of our regular places. Love the ambiance outside with good seating and views (if you can get a seat). The car staff are excellent and can make great cocktails and vary them as per your taste. The wait staff is what usually let this place down as the service you get depends on the person/day/mood/rush.... We still keep going back due to location and bar staff.',\n"," 'Came here to eat breakfast, but was really dissapointed. We waited for a long time for someone to take our orders and when the food finally came after a long period, we got served the wrong food. We told them and they went to fix it. When they came back, we still got the wrong order. We ordered bread, but didn’t get it until 15 minutes later than the rest of the food. If you compare the food and service with the prices, I don’t recommend this place at all. Not worth it.',\n"," \"First impression was not good when they informed us that they could not find our reservation even though I called to confirm the day before. Not an issue since the Maître was really nice and find a sit for us quickly. I wanted to treat my mum to a typical afternoon tea since she was visiting from abroad and I could not have chosen a worse place.  The service was beyond bad, we ordered afternoon tea not only they did not bring sugar for the coffee, no cutlery ,no water.. but the waitress did a pretty ugly gesture when I asked her for plates. When she came back , she was only bringing one. The staff in general did not know the number of the tables so they approached us 9 times to ask if that was the food we ordered, 9 times !! I spent 60 pounds which is more that 70 euros to eat ham and cheese sandwiches (2) stale scones and rancid biscuits. It totally ruined the whole experienced for me and my mum. I honestly just wanted to leave as soon as possible. We were uncomfortable from the beginning. I spoke to the manager to share my experience and I honestly felt he was not even listening. I have gone for afternoon tea before and never had such an awful experience. This is not way I had expected from a ''5 star'' hotel. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Too disappointing overall.\",\n"," \"We reserved a table for dinner at 5.00 pm before the theatre. We were warmly welcomed and shown to our table where we were quickly offered drinks whilst perusing the menu. Lovely views over London and really close to the theatres.

Service was Ok but the place looked a little unloved and the drinks eye wateringly expensive. Better views and service elsewhere.',\n"," 'Called in just for a lunchtime drink. The hostess at the reception was quite rude & got quite snotty when a lady behind us saw her friend she was meeting & told her to get back in line & wait her turn. We sat at the bar as obviously the tables were reserved for diners. Ordered a cocktail & a beer. Extremely over priced with an additional £3 service charge which I was totally shocked about. (We would have left a tip)  Won’t be back sorry NOT sorry. ',\n"," 'We googled after noon tea in London and the first place to pop up was Radio Rooftop in London. We reserved an outside table to have tea several weeks in advanced. We were in town to attend my Wife’s Uncles funeral and wanted to spend some time in London and enjoy tea and a view. This was our first dining experience in London. When we arrived to the restaurant we were told there were no seats available outside for the view. Instead sitting us near the bar but close to the front entry. We were disappointed but didn’t complain. The hostess said as soon as a spot was open outside she would move us. She proceeded walking by us 20 times. How do We know? Well we know as 20 of those times it was to take others outside to tables after we were told there was nothing available. We listened in on many asking to be moved outside and some didn’t even have reservations. Several times she made eye contact with us when she walked by and could tell she knew what we were thinking. Then it took over 1.5 hours to get our tea and food, which consisted of a tray of simple foods. Nothing cooked just some little sandwich cut outs, rolls with butter and jelly and some small deserts. At the end of the terrible experience we spent 85 pounds. 9 pounds for a bottle of water. 85! For tea and a tray of crap snacks to be honest.  Best part was when the waiter first came to our table we were asked to put a credit card down before we ordered. They gave us a key to retrieve our cc when we left. We didn’t understand why but obliged thinking it was the norm. Again, literally the first place we had chosen to sit down and eat at in London. After our terrible service, slow attention, and on our way out we asked why we had to put down a cc. We were told that some don’t pay their bills and sometimes they ask in advanced when there is concern.  So, we didn’t get put outside because we looked like we were going to dine and dash? Is that why we were put in area where they could watch us? Do we look that shady? Married couple with English accents in their 40’s? We didn’t argue, didn’t complain, just paid and left.  It was our worst experience we have ever had traveling. We weren’t dressed like slobs just casual and others came and went in various outfits. Only thing we could think of us we weren’t local? They should be ashamed of themselves! Have never written a review that is how disgusted we were. ',\n"," 'Great place to get poor service and rude waitstaff. Drink service is sloooow. Food service is even slower. Not worth the effort. Great bait and switch venue.

Went to the bar to wait for our table that we’d been told would be 10 mins, ordered 2 aperol sprtiz and was charged £38!!!! A 12% service charge for ordering and paying for a drink at the bar. I expect to pay high prices in such a central location but that was ridiculous.  At 5:30pm we asked if they’d forgotten about us - to be fair the hostess actually said yes then took us to our table. After waiting forever someone grumpily took our order. Food was ok, nothing special.  This was by far the worst service I’ve received for a very long time. It was busy but not packed. Simply no excuse. ',\n"," \"Amazing view. Came here for my birthday treat with the gf. Highly recommend for a drink with a great food but they're hopeless with food. Ordered the steak medium rare and came out dry and well done, no pink whatsoever. Waiter took back, no apology or offer of any compensation.

Again view is amazing but just come for a drink\",\n"," 'Amazing views (will be even better when they take the side awning down in the warmer weather). Utterly shambolic poor service - waited 40 minutes for a drink, no apology. Food average and the presentation (especially given the cost) is abysmal. Will I come again?

Booked. After entering building the wow effect of cleanliness and black marble done its job and during trip in elevator we expected more and more wows. And we recieved them. Beautiful bar, beautiful decor, beautiful views and very polite host took us to our table and we start enjoying beautiful views and enjoyed bit of spring sun. Than, our waiter appeared. Hi how are you...  So far everything went well. We ordered couple of drinks and olives. Drinks arrived..wine perfectly chilled, cocktail perfectly refreshing. Ohhh thats great that\\'s exactly what we were looking forward.  We already looked into the menu and we have choosen our starter, mains, sides. Olives nowhere to be seen. Well, I have to grab the waiter and ask about our olives. \"Ohhh we don\\'t have\": was his answer. Fantastic. What else you don\\'t have. Waiter just say three items, I hardly understand what is he saying. At least he brought some puffed corns. Little effort, just throw it on table without word. Than my glass was empty... And was still empty... 10 Ten us number of minutes while I was sitting there with empty glass. Not that I was hungry, i am thirsty again.

We called the bar 4 times and got cut off each time, this was for a birthday celebration so at this stage we were freezing cold stood outside and irritated especially as people that passed the lock door didn’t come over to help, etc. Eventually we went into a nearby bar and they directed us through a separate hotel (which had no sign saying it was a way through to the bar...) and went up a back way. We said to the staff that the back door was locked and they responded saying it is very confusing...so change the sign/ put on there where to go? Whilst we were waiting groups of others tried to enter and went elsewhere as it was “shut”. Once we were in the bar it was lovely, views outside especially great.

Nice welcome and table on the terrace with heaters as a bit cool. Not rushed and good level of service. Food was good. Best steak I have had for sometime. Good desert and nice surroundings.

On one of the cocktails we were told that they didn’t have the ingredients for which was disappointing considering the price that we were paying for them! Also the beer mat that we were given were dirty which was below expectations of a bar which prides itself in its high standards.

I ordered a Ruby Spark Cocktail which which arrived in a glass half the size of a Babycham glass and was truly the most horrible thing I've ever tasted, my friend has a Radio Garden which i tried and was equally as horrible, both £15.00 each. We decided to move on the gin menu. I asked if they had any flavored gin, they said no, how surprising!? I spotted a pink gin on the menu so ordered that, but they'd ran out of that so i opted for a Sipsmith gin, I assumed the price of £13.00 would include a tonic, but no there was a charge for that on the bill along with a service charge too. The said tonic was warm, seriously this is the sort of thing that should never happen in a well run bar. The service and staff were very polite and fairly attentive but the mediocre drinks were a real downer for me, I wouldn't have minded the price tag if the drinks had been worth it, but sadly with a bill of just under £65.00 i felt a bit short changed, so I wouldn't return and wouldn't recommend.\",\n"," 'Great open-air bar with a view to see London.

At this time of the evening it was less than a quarter full and I asked politely why we couldn't sit at one of the other tables, her response was no issues. We were sat at the table & given menus, then less than a few minutes later she came back and said we could order but we would need to move back to the high table in 30 minutes time as all the tables were booked. When I questioned this because there were so many tables empty and none had reserved signs on them she said they are just fully booked. I challenged her and said that if she expected us to order food and drink and then move in less than 30 minutes time that wasn't acceptable. After a debate on the poor service and they way we were expected to order but be moved around she said we could stay there and she would move the table bookings around to accommodate us. So either she wasn't telling the truth in the first place or some poor guest who had booked the table wouldn't get what they booked. I decided after such poor service we would leave as they didn't deserve the custom, especially at the prices they charge. When leaving I informed the woman at the main entrance that we were not staying due to the way we were treated, she shrugged her shoulders and said ok. Instead we went to STK underneath, it was like day and night, so accommodating and very polite. Radio needs to put staff on the same training that STK does. Pretentious staff who have no customer care or service.  I just hope the person in charge takes note and removes these staff and hire staff who care as I wont be coming back.\",\n"," 'Delicious cocktails. Awesome views over London. Attentive staff.

The only minor thing, is the drink prices were very high for what you receive. I guess that’s a London thing these days.

Nevertheless, a lovely spot in London for a few drinks with stunning views.',\n"," 'Lovely cocktails with views of London. Usually a nice atmosphere but door staff completely let it down.

This place looks really good. They were busy and we ordered our food and drinks. They had a reduced Brunch menu for Sunday lunch and could not order off the full menu. Despite the reduced menu they had already run out of 2 of the main courses. We ordered 2 x steak and chips. 1st arrived after a while. The waitress expressed surprise when I asked if it was the medium or medium rare steak. Obviously only one steak order had made it to the kitchen. After about 5 minutes I signalled for the waitress who had taken our order to come over. I told her the delay was not acceptable. I told her that my girlfriends steak would be cold by the time mine arrived and that I did not want to pay for my late steak. She responded with “oh, so you don’t want the steak then!” I told her I wanted it but did not want to pay. She then came back after about 5 minutes and said that my steak would be another few minutes and that I would not need to pay for it. Another 10 mins and my steak eventually arrived. I asked for the manager to come and see us. My chips were very under cooked as if they had been rushed. When the manager arrived she gave the excuses of she was trying to manage 2 sections on top few staff. I told her that should not be my problem and maybe if they could not cope they should not accept bookings from customers. She was hardly apologetic, so I told her I did not want to pay for either meal and asked for my credit card back. This place is probably worth trying again at a less busy time, but our Sunday lunch experience was not good.',\n"," 'Best spot in London for brunch and looked after amazingly by Fabio (he takes fab pics too )   The views are amazing and the staff can’t do enough to make you happy',\n"," 'They treated me like I was in primary school.

Just a shame about service & food. The waitress was rude, no other way of describing her! Our food then came out, all at different times (why would you serve a side portion of fries 15 minutes before the main course?) and one dish didn’t have the right ingredients so it was sent back. The rest of the food was luke warm. When we mentioned this, the waitress simply shrugged her shoulders! They advertised a festive cream tea but when one of us went to order it, we were told the kitchen was too busy to prepare it and that we should have preordered!

Felt like a place ‘to be seen’ more than anything else.',\n"," 'Visited this restaurant for a light lunch pre-theatre. Staff were friendly and welcoming and tapas-style food was very nice. Interesting cocktail menu - sadly not sampled on this occasion! Decor is very chic, but not at all intimidating. There is a great view as it is on the 10th floor. I think prices were average for London: £11 for a glass of wine! My only criticism would be that it was hard to find the entrance! The daytime entrance is through the (also very chic) ME Hotel on The Strand but there is nothing at street level to indicate this. There is another entrance at the back of the building which does say “Radio”, but it is only open after 6pm and there is nothing apart from the name plate. I feel it would be useful to put a sign on that entrance directing customers to the daytime entrance. I would have given 5 stars had we not had this difficulty as we had a very enjoyable lunch and the atmosphere was great too.',\n"," 'Don’t waste your money.

We took our drinks outside to see the view and this threw the staff into a tailspin as they seemed incapable to calculating our bill once we had left the table. We sat at a table for 40 minutes which was strewn with the detritus of the previous customer.

We also got given the wrong bill too, not sure how that happened as they took our card and we got given a number at the beginning.

The atmosphere is fairly laid back and the venue has some decent views over London. Construction work was going on throughout our visit, with one side closed off and workers wandering through with materials. It appeared as though awnings were being installed. I would have expected that a timing for this could have been found that wouldn't interrupt lunch.  We ordered a selection of starters to share between the four of us. One of which was bread, which consisted of three slices. I would have expected that having explained that this was for four that an additional slice would have been included or advice provided that we might want to order more. The plates that we used for starters were left on the table after they were finished with and remained there whilst we were eating our main course. The waiter recommended the Sea Bass for the main course, which one of our party ordered. It arrived overdone and was returned. The other food was fine, but nothing special and not worth a premium. Tap water was provided for the table in individual glasses and these were not refilled throughout the meal. The drinks that we ordered were all good, but when one item wasn't available, an alternative was brought instead of checking with the guest first. All in all, I wouldn't go back to Radio for food. The bar service looked OK and so I would consider this a decent place to go for a drink and experience the views. The outside areas were slightly chilly, but if the awnings are a success (with the existing halogen heaters), this could be a roof top bar that is good for drinks on a clear winter day.\",\n"," 'nice place withe tasty drinks and fancy design.

We’ve been here multiple times as a walk in or with a booking as a couple and with large groups and todays experience 13/10/18 with the women and doorman was pathetic. First we are looked up and down and when they spot my Rolex and trainers they look for an alternative excuse to dress code as a way to turn us away. So then we are told they are too busy upstairs. I prove this BS when I call the booking line in front if the door staff who immediately offer us a table or say we can stand at the bar for a drink.  So the third attempt to turn us away was the trash girl telling us “the people in the booking office don’t know how busy we are. We make the booking here” .

Location views, dri is etc great, staff: unless you are young and well healed expect second or third class welcome and I use the word welcome reluctantly as that is not what I would describe our experience\",\n"," 'I’d been going to Radio Bar on and off for the last 4 years and had always found it to be a nice rooftop retreat with good food, service and music. Early evening on weekends was my favourite, still not too busy and the sun setting over London. It’s a pretty special place to have coffee cocktails at that time of day. Unfortunately, in 2017 I noticed the crowd and music changing - for the worse. It started to get real tacky with cheap house music and percussionists, themed nights such as ‘red’ and ‘white’ parties and a more trashy crowd. I haven’t really been back since autumn of last year. The food is always good and the cocktails are still great as are the bar tenders. Prices reflect the location as with most central London venues.  Hopefully this was just a phase as it was a really classy place before then.....',\n"," 'A friend took me and I was singularly unimpressed. Our view was of the tops of dirty London buildings, which I can see from the train. My cocktail, the chips and Parmesan chips were good, but it took us twice asking and waiting about 10 minutes to get some tomato sauce. Terrible service and the people around us were complaining too. Won’t be back. ',\n"," \"After a lovely previous visit, what a difference this 1 was, lady on arrival very rude, we said just wanted 1 drink before our pre theatre lunch, she said all reserved, it had just opened at 12, she sent a waitress with us to a table just outside in a corner facing a workstation, so no views of London, & in the shade, we asked if we could move as would only be there a short while, she went back & checked with lady at the entrance, a firm 'no came back! After getting our cocktails, 1 arrived with a chip out, & a crack running down the glass, which we sent back, we left after our 1 drink, with almost all the rooftop bar still empty, customer service could have easily made our visit much better but chose not to, very rude on arrival, & interesting to see other reviews stating abt customer service, I won't be rushing back, interesting if we get any response back from Radio bar??\",\n"," 'If you like terrible customer service, rude bar staff, zero atmosphere no access to the outside (at a rooftop bar) and watching 20 something’s playing on their phones - this is definitely the place for you! Would never normally review',\n"," 'Lady at the door was so rude & unhelpful. Fair enough you were apparently “full” (letting other people in after us), she expected us to wait in street for her to command if & when she’d allow us to have 1 drink. We’d come directly from my friends birthday dinner and were so disappointed by her obnoxious behaviour. My friends & I didn’t waste our time and moved on but a smile and an adult approach would’ve been sufficient, as there are plenty of similar bars with a friendly approach towards guests/customers. ',\n"," 'Overrated, overpriced bar. Staff need to go on customer service training rather rude. Food reasonable but a long wait- would not rush back, can imagine rather tacky on a weekend',\n"," \"My previous review on this place back in April was glowing - what a difference a few months makes! Appalling customer service, quite rude in fact! Chipped & cracked glass, got there at opening time for a short visit to be told tables with the view were reserved but they were still empty when we left and we did tell them upon arrival we only were on a quick visit. We were so disappointed and we will now source a new rooftop bar, it's such a shame it's gone downhill which is clearly evident on numerous recent reviews!\",\n"," 'We started our short break in the capital with drinks at Radio. Been a lot at night but never through the day and have to say I enjoyed it more! Views were great / drinks as well were quick and excellent. We each received a glass of champagne as we were hotel guests which was a nice touch! The best bit of a place like this is people watching and we were not disappointed with a real mix of all nationalities present! Or really the best thing is the view. Great place for celeb spotting on a Saturday night!',\n"," \"I am wheat intolerant and love scones. I was so impressed by the amazing afternoon tea that I had here last Tuesday. The chef made me my own scones and they were delicious! The top tier was so beautiful and very tasty - the nicest creme brûlée every. The chef also made an amazing middle tier, my favourite was the hash brown with Asparagus. I will remember the food for a long time! I'm definitely going back. The view is amazing and the staff were good fun. I really enjoyed the afternoon. One little annoyance was there were a few wasps after the jam that we had to dodge.\",\n"," \"First Night in London so we didn't want to venture far, Radio rooftop was the obvious choice for us all. It is a great place to hangout for drinks in the evening. Dinner was very good, however the service was slow. If you just want to chill and have a good time. This is the place to be.\",\n"," \"Essentially, there wasn't any service. Initially we ordered tap water for the table whilst we chose cocktails. We sat down for the first half an hour, sitting looking at the menu, trying to catch someone's eye. It took the first quarter of our 2 hour sitting to even order our drinks, at which point I'd had to chase the waiting staff to ask them to take our order. This continued for the entire evening. On every occasion we ordered, we had to physically stand and find a member of staff, then waited about 20 minutes until they actually came. On one occasion we even ordered at the bar because we got so fed up of waiting. The tap water took 2 hours to eventually come, after about 4 reminders. On another note, I asked whether the espresso martinis were vegan. The waitress returned to say that they weren’t. I asked if the cocktail could be made vegan, given that a couple of us are vegan guests and the answer was a straight no. On the basis that a classic espresso martini contains coffee liqueur, espresso and vodka, this really didn't seem unreasonable. When you are paying almost £20 for a single drink, you would expect excellent service and exemplary quality. The service was entirely non-existent and the overall quality of the experience was just not there. Needless to say, we asked for service to be removed from the bill. The waitress seemed utterly shocked by this which was both rude and ridiculous, given that service should definitely not be expected. When the bill eventually came, it was over £40 too much, which quite frankly, was the final straw. It was totally laughable that when I originally booked, there was a minimum spend of £40 per head. How on earth can guests be expected to spend this much when orders aren’t even taken!! It is such a shame because this bar has such great potential in both location, views, drinks and quality. If Radio Bar lost the pretence and gained some humility, the experience would have felt genuine and overall more enjoyable. If you decide to visit for the wonderful views and lovely outdoor seating area, be careful not to be conned into paying 12.5% for non-existent service.\",\n"," 'Cocktails are was a maizing but the staff member are useless. Place is so nice and enjoyable, but the waiting time is such a long to get the outside table. I had to wait our and 15min but nobody is looking after what is gonna happening, so Iam really disappointed,I have been many placese but I never had to wait more the one hour to get outside table. Me and my friend we working for a 5 star hotel in Luton (Luton Hoo Golf and Spa) so I was expecting to get something more. ',\n"," 'I booked a table for 8 people at STK three weeks in advance to ensure there was availability, this is something I would advise on if you are a larger party looking to ensure you get a booking. I had booked this for my friends birthday, as part of the celebration I also booked a table at Radio, this is the bar that is next to STK and part of the same group.  I made the STK booking through Opentable which was painless, but booked Radio over the phone. I booked Radio over the phone because our group was all blokes and I wanted to ensure that we would get in as it was my friends birthday. I know what most clubs policies are around all male groups and wanted to avoid any issues. On the Friday before our booking, I was called to confirm my booking for STK and then for Radio, when this call came through I once again reiterated the fact that we were an all male group. I was assured that this would not be a problem as we had booked a table and as long as we were in before 11 this would not be an issue. By the time Saturday came around, our party had reduced from 8 to 6 people. Upon arrival at STK we were running around 10 minutes late, we walked past Radio and I mentioned to the lady on the door that we may, therefore, be 10 minutes later for our reservation at Radio. She asked me, “Are you a mixed group of 8?” I explained that we were now down to 6 and that we were an all male group. At which point she shook her head and said that we probably wouldn’t be allowed in without a mixed group. I proceeded to explain about our booking and that it was my friends birthday etc. She said that as long as we were all smartly dressed and gave the door staff no reason to not less us in, we would be fine. However, alarm bells had started ringing for me due to her attitude, so I contacted a group of friends to see if they would come along so that we would have a mixed group.  When we arrived at STK, no one greeted us or made an effort to seat us, we had to ask several waiters before one of them pointed out the front desk. Once we spoke to the desk we were seated quickly. The food was good, but if you are going for food there is a lot of places in London that offer better food at a significantly lower price. The atmosphere was great and the DJ was brilliant. The real issue is that there seemed to be a significant lack of staff, both waiters and bar staff. This meant that ordered any food or drinks was painfully slow. When the final bill came, this was £140 per person, without starters or deserts.  After dinner we headed to Radio, once the hostess saw myself and our group, she immediately asked me to come for a chat, surrounded by 4 members of security who were all staring me down. She advised that despite us now having a mixed group we would not be allowed into the venue for security reasons. When I asked why, she said she was not willing to disclose that information. Effectively, she did not like the look of our group, despite us all being smartly dressed and having a table reservation we were turned away for no reason. I would go so far as to say that this was blatant discrimination due to the appearance of our group and some of our backgrounds. I think it is fair to say that this is completely unacceptable from any establishment to discriminate like this.  I understand that clubs reserve the right to refuse entry to individuals / groups especially when they are intoxicated etc however, none of us were, we were all smartly dressed and we had a table reserved. It is extremely disappointing to have our night and my friends birthday ruined by this blatant discrimination.',\n"," 'So we had a reservation downstairs in STK for 5.30. we arrived at the entrance to the radio roof top bar at 17:05 and was let in by the bouncer only to be stopped by a lady using her hand, we said can we just get a drink for 15/20 minutes before our reservation in STK only to be told, yes but minimum spend is £75. I said how do you spend £75 in 15 minutes, she was having none of it!! Stuck up, rude and lost out on a potential of £30 for a 15 minute drink. Why not just say yes ladies of course, but we will require the table back in 20 minutes, instead of leaving the table empty, getting bad reviews and also disgruntled customers who shall never return, customer service training needed urgently and if someone could remind the lady working on the door she is a lady working on a door and to not be so snooty and rude!!!',\n"," \"As most places in London the drink prices are ridiculous and this place carries on that trend. £24 for a glass of red wine and a mocktail. The service was poor due to it being slow and unclear that when I went to pay for the drinks my card was taken away and replaced with a token. This was not made clear to me and I do not feel comfortable when someone takes my bank card out of my sight.  It took quite a while to return my card after requesting it back. Plus the popcorn they provide free of charge is stale and tastes burnt. Don't think we'll be going back.\",\n"," 'A visit here was recommended by a (much younger) friend. The hotel is very modern and I loved the decor on the ground floor. After a phone call up to the bar - we hadn’t made a reservation but had rung beforehand to ask if we could just have a drink- we went up in the dedicated lift. It is stylish in almost every way, the exception being the wait staff uniforms which can only be described as ghastly. ( IMO Wet cement colour, shapeless and unpleasant material). The service was cool professional in some cases and friendly in others. We were seated inside but were able to wander out on to the terraces to take in the views and take pix. It was a glorious day so the views were excellent.  Once we left I guess the average age dropped by about 25 years!',\n"," 'I booked a table here for 6 people after dinner at STK. I am a loyal Me Hotel member. STK were running late so we advised the door staff at the bar. We arrived 20 mins late to be told our table had been given away. No offer to try to find me a new table although happy to let non booked people in. I have read many bad reports about this place and i can see why. Should be a 5 star place but not with the service they offer. I booked the table via my bank concierge service so was even more shocked how we were dealt with.',\n"," 'Nice place, great views for G&T. Sat at the bar, as did not want to be forced to spend at least £50 to have a table outside. Normally spend more than this just don’t want to be forced. Quick service when we got there, but my wife asked a barman just for a glass of water...answer “I am serving someone” not “no problem with you in a minute”, customer service is easy, but not in this case. My wife is not kind of person to be rude too.  You need ID too, to get in.',\n"," 'I can absolutely endorse all the negative comments about this bar. It is not what it pretends to be. Ignore the dress code, most other people appear to - it says ‘smart & glamorous’ but the reality is very different. Many guests were in trainers & jeans. The service is slow & poor. Nuts & olives took 25 mins to be served, & it wasn’t a busy night.  Avoid this roof top bar - it’s expensive & disappointing. We left rafter 40 minutes. Dreadful!',\n"," 'Love the chic sophistication of this London roof top bar!  Great location in the center of town and a nice mix of indoor/outdoor seating with heated options too. We came for afternoon, and after an initial mix up on the booking was seated and had a great selection of sandwiches and desserts. Hostess was lovely Romaniain (forgot her name!) lady who was genuine and very attentive.  Would love to come back for evening drinks and sample the vibe then also!',\n"," 'I organised a birthday afternoon tea for my other half and we had a lovely time. With a party of ten, it is not always easy but the staff were incredible, so helpful and willing to accommodate us! There were some hiccups in the ordering of the tea (need to state in your booking, which I did) but they sorted this out albeit with a bit of waiting. The photos which I am posting here was taken by the fine tattooed gentleman in black leather and he together with the other gentleman in a white tee made us feel so welcomed. The views were fab and on a sunny day, it was perfect. The food was delicious too. Everybody enjoyed themselves. All in all, a great and memorable experience!',\n"," \"We had drinks in the Radio rooftop bar whilst staying at the ME hotel. The rooftop was a lovely experience as the views are fab and we were there for sunset so it was really lovely to see the changing colours of the sky as the sun went down. We hadn't booked but were able to get a great table outside with fab view. Be warned it isn't cheap though and cocktails start at £15 upwards! Was a bit aggrieved that even though we ordered and waited for drinks at the bar, still had 12% service added on! Wouldn't have minded if someone had come to our table to take our order but it was a bit much when we went to get our own! Didn't stay for too many as was working out £34+ per two drinks!\",\n"," 'My wife and I attempted to go to Radio Rooftop Bar yesterday, it was her 30th birthday and we wanted somewhere nice to go for a couple of drinks before an evening show. I called them in the morning to ask to book a table but was told that for 2 people we didn\\'t need to, just show up, if it was a group of 5 or something then we would but it would be fine. I asked if it would be busy around 5:30 and was told that it would probably be getting busy but should be OK. So we turned up there at about half 5 and was directed through the hotel to the lift area. We were immediately asked by the lift attendant if we had a booking, to which I replied no - and she said she would need to radio up to see if there was room for us. Not a problem necessarily. But what happened next should have been a massive sign! The lift opened and was full of people all coming out of the lift. Again, not a problem, but in hindsight can see completely why this happened. We were the only people there waiting to begin with, but after about 10 minutes waiting there was a group of about 15 people all waiting to go up to the rooftop. Now we are 30, we are well past the feeling of having to wait around outside bars to get in, it doesn\\'t mean it shows exclusivity, it\\'s just annoying! So eventually we were told we could go up. There was 3 lifts and the lift attendant pressed the call button, the middle lift opened. She told us that only the left hand side lift went up to the roof top bar. But the left hand side lift never opened! So we waited more, every so often pressing the call button, and every time the middle or right hand side lifts were opening! Eventually we got in the middle lift which did in fact go straight to the rooftop bar - surely a lift attendant should know what lift to go to... When we arrived at the bar, again we were asked if we had a reservation - no. Based on what we were told next, I am suprised that the bar has any customers. They said that there was a minimum spend of £50 PER PERSON and you could spend 2 hours on the rooftop. I said that first of all we don\\'t want to be here for 2 hours - only one of two drinks before our show, but even if we did want to spend all evening here, after spending £100+ between us, would we be escorted out?! The hosts had such a bad attitude about the whole thing, you could tell that this is a conversation that they have very regularly.  One of their responses was \"oh well the cocktails start at £15 so it\\'s not that much to spend...\" - and yes, whilst we were prepared to pay the premium for the venue, £15 is still a lot for a cocktail, especially when you\\'re pushed to spend £100 between you in 2 hours! Out of the lift of 20 or so people, not one stayed. The bar completely missed out on all of our custom by their archaic rules. Londoners expect value for money or at least when they are paying more, the service should be exceptional. The bar had many opportunities to explain their ridiculous rules - either on the phone in the morning, or the lift attendant, or just a sign by the lifts would have sufficed. If they continue to operate the same they will definitely not last, and it can be seen by the numerous negative tripadvisor reviews that this is a regular occurrence. We spoke to the doormen of the hotel on our way out who explained that the bar and hotel were operated by different people but that everyone was well aware of the problems with the rooftop bar. They need to completely re-think their strategy. We ended up crossing over the road and having a few drinks in a great London pub instead. There are numerous alternatives to go to and I would urge you to steer clear of here.',\n"," \"Hip, chic, buzzing, classy with the most amazing views!! Go there, you won't be disappointed. Book in advance and reserve a table looking over Somerset House.\",\n"," 'I went a week or so ago and was told that I could not sit where I wanted as it was to hot for the staff to walk around serving drinks? After paying £40 for two cocktails I think a staff member can walk 3 metres to serve a drink. Will never go again unless someone made my next visit more enjoyable, also found the waitress rude.',\n"," 'I visited this place with a friend of mine who was my guest from Italy, apparently there is a Radio rooftop in Milan also. Unfortunately our visit was disappointing, and it was mainly because of the service. The stuff keep reminding us more than three times about the minimum £75 per person charge, I have been told on the phone at the time of reservation, at the time of the confirmation then at arrival and once more at the table!!! What on earth!!! I agreed once I gave my credit card details! I didn’t want my guest to hear about the charge all the time!  The atmosphere is not as pleasant, the music is too loud inside and although we were cold we preferred to seat outside because of it. We started with cocktails then we ordered some food and a bottle of wine. The food looks good but a bit salty for my liking.  I would not go back as there are other places in London with similar view and better service. ',\n"," 'Have always booked before coming to this bar, which, reading the below comments, I think must make a huge difference. Recently visited on a hot & sunny Sunday evening. Outside on the balcony the view & sunset were stunning. Our waiter was fabulous and, to be honest, I have always found the staff to be great. The first cocktail I ordered was simply not to my taste (didn’t read the menu properly) & we were not charged for it. Lovely food, delicious fruity cocktails recommended by the waiter. The prices are what we expect to pay in a venue like this in central London. The rigmarole of showing photo ID is admittedly unnecessary - long gone are the days when this was a regular occurrence (more’s the pity). I do love this venue. My partner can be quite critical of venues we go to but even he gives it 9/10 - high praise indeed! ',\n"," 'Definitely worth a visit. Definitely need to book at peak times.

We decided to go anyways, when we got there the hostess downstairs warned us there weren’t any tables outside and that we needed our ID, I explained I had a Spanish ID for EU citizens that didn’t have a photo, however I had a photo of my passport, she replied to me in a very sarcastic kinda way saying that was bizarre because she was Spanish and her ID had a photo. Well she is not a EU citizen with a Spanish ID so that was my second disappointment! I mean I think is so sad that hostess are meant to be those pretty ladies with an attitude, I am past the phase that this was acceptable and cool! Anyways we get upstairs we let a couple out the elevator and they are taken to a table outside either they had a reservation ( that I wasn’t allowed to make) or they had a table that didn’t exist! Anyways I am feeling a bit odd to have chosen this place when Greg comes in to save the day! Him and Jorge waited our table with impeccable service and in the end took us outside where there were plenty of space and took our pics! It is sad that all the girls had an arrogant attitude towards us! Everything was overpriced, but that is expected when you have that view the worse is overpriced associated with uneducated arrogant hostess.

Yes, there is a good view from the roof top but there are other bars and restaurants which offer equally good views. Cocktails at 15 pounds each for a very small glass were well over priced and the young lady who served us with ours managed to spill some of my \"Goldust\" cost cocktail over the table and didn\\'t bother to get a cloth to wipe the table or say sorry. It\\'s a place to go to be seen and say you have been to but as I say, there are other much nicer relaxed places to go for a cocktail and drink in the West End and the City.',\n"," 'We’ve had a lovely afternoon/evening at the Rooftop bar.

What a shambles! We waited 20 mins to order our first drink and then waited 20 more to get it (2 beers and a softie) we were then ignored for another 40 trying to order a second drink.

We were informed of a £30 per head minimum charge and advised to book in advance which we did. On arrival in the hotel lobby we had to wait for 20 minutes in a queue for the only lift up to the bar. A member of staff at the head of the queue was checking each name against a booking list and turning those without bookings away. But unfortunately this was not disseminated to the other end of the queue! As a result numerous groups queued for 15-20 mins for nothing!  Once on the roof, we were met by a waitress who informed us that we would have to wait 15 minutes for our first drink and 45 minutes for any food. We immediately began to make plans to eat elsewhere. Eventually our drinks did arrive; 10 unopened bottles of beer, without glasses (despite us requesting them) and no bottle opener. It took another 5 minutes for the waiter to find us one so we could enjoy our small bottles of beer. Everyone at the surrounding tables seemed to be experiencing the same poor levels of customer service; it was hopelessly disorganised and we left after 1 1/2 hours having had 3 beers which, due to the minimum charge of £30 per head, cost £10 each!  Please don’t go to Radio Rooftop expecting good food (or any food) or any sort of acceptable customer service! The only good thing about our visit was the view of the RAF’s Flypast.',\n"," 'Came here for pre-dinner drinks with friends a few days ago. First piece of advice though is either book or come as soon as it opens, as two of us arrived just after it opened and had real trouble getting a table, although finally we were given a table for 2 (even though we told them our third friend was on her way and there were countless empty tables, which were, apparently, “reserved”). The views from here are excellent and on a barmy, summer evening it was very relaxing to sit and chat and gaze out over the city. The service itself was not that good – very slow and inattentive at times, which, for an establishment such as this, was not expected. However, the cocktail menu offers up some interesting options and the drinks themselves are very good (and priced at around £15 each). Our friend arrived later but had awful trouble trying to get in as security stopped her from even getting in the lift – even though she told them she was meeting us. We asked one of the waitresses to speak on the phone to security downstairs to confirm we were here, but she said it was not up to her (which was not very helpful). Eventually after several calls down (which took over about 15 minutes), they let her in. There were still lots of empty tables so we tasked if we could sit at one of the bigger tables (as we were going downstairs in less than half an hour for our meal and all these tables had been reserved the whole time we were there, yet nobody was actually sitting in them) we were told we could, which we did, and when we left for dinner (2 ½ hours after we had arrived – all those reserved tables were still empty!) I would suggest they take bookings in time-slots or allow people in to sit at the reserved seats with the understanding they would have a limited time until the people who reserved actually turned up. I would also suggest that if a member of a party joining people already inside arrives later there is a simple system to let them come in. However, that aside I would definitely come here again – for the view and the setting alone.',\n"," 'Pre-booked a table here for afternoon tea for my husbands birthday today. Had read the previous reviews but decided to take the risk. We were seated promptly and offered drinks. The waiter seemed surprised when I asked what types of tea were on offer?! Waited half an hour for our food, however when it came there was plenty and it was good. After eating the sandwiches we needed more cutlery and had to sit a good ten minutes before we caught someone’s attention (not our original waiter who we didn’t see again). We then needed a spoon, I caught the eye of a waiter who looked aghast at being asked for something. Same story when my husband walked inside to ask for the bill. I had asked when making my reservation if they could mark the fact it was my husbands birthday, I received a reply to say they would put a message on the desert, this didn’t happen. The place was not particularly busy and there seemed to be a lot of people doing little. Shame. Even more of a shame when they automatically add 12.5% service charge to the bill (which I would have paid happily, perhaps even more if they had treated us properly).',\n"," 'We went for a pre dinner drink, it was a beautiful day, great views over the city. Nice drinks and good service. Do reserve a table.',\n"," \"I was a little apprehensive after reading some of the reviews on here and approached the front desk, upon arrival, with some trepidation. However the lady was lovely and ushered me straight through to the lifts and the bar staff were equally friendly and I was served straight away each time I went to the bar. Drinks aren't cheap but you are in central London. The view was amazing although unfortunately we o my managed to get a table inside but we were by the door so there was a lovely cool breeze on what was a very warm day.\",\n"," \"Make sure you go here with lots of time on your hands. We went up to the bar with the intention of having a drink or two mid-afternoon as it was fairly quiet in the restaurant. Upon arrival we were asked what we wanted and then directed to a nice seat outside with a lovely view and told the drinks (2 bottles of beer) will be right out. After 15 minutes of waiting we got someone's attention who was stood idle, and he too promised to bring them right out. Over 10 minutes later we saw him taking an order for someone else so asked a third member of staff where our drinks were and her first remark was to ask us to move seats as the section we were directed to initially was apparently 'not open' for another 2 hours. We happily obliged her request and then sat and waited for yet another 10 minutes for her to eventually bring our drinks. Needless to say we asked for the bill after that drink only to be faced with a service charge! It's outrageous how these places think they can treat customers like this and still expect them to pay a 12.5% mark up on their bill.\",\n"," 'Such an excellent location with great views of London. Amazing cocktails great hang out spot with friends for a drink!',\n"," 'So my husband phoned up a week ago to see if we needed to reserve a place at this bar on the terrace mid afternoon on a Friday. ‘No’, said the person on the other end of the phone, ‘not at that time’. Arrived early and the very first thing the front of house staff say is ‘do you have a reservation’. ‘No, you told us we didn’t need one when we phoned’. Silence...’why did you tell my husband we didn’t need one?’ ‘Well we book up in advance’. No apology, face bovvered...appalling and misleading service all round. ',\n"," 'Here for pre-dinner drinks with family. We opted for outside seating and were given seats with views along the Thames. Service was good and there was a good selection of cocktails available. A minus for us was that outdoor area could be used by smokers and several stood at the side of where we were sitting so we were treated to their smoke - not pleasant. Apparently other people in their party objected to their smoking at the table they were sitting at!  We were impressed by the fact that paper straws were being used and cocktail sticks were wooden - very eco friendly, The staff were pleasant and helpful.

However one friend did not have ID (so was not allowed in, and it does specify that this is required). The other friend met us as the door host said it was better to wait for the rest of the party. We all arrived 20 mins past our booking. By this point our reservation has been given away even though the door host was aware of our intent to fulfill our reservation. The fact that two of the party arrived and then our table was given away is disgraceful considering we reserved the table about 3-4 weeks in advance and we were unable to get through on the phoneline.

Afternoon tea extremely average, no sandwiches, all pretty much sweet cakes and they forgot to give us the tea - how can you forget that, it’s in the name???? Can get much much better in London for the price you pay. Expected 5 star service, but because we weren’t dressed head to toe in Gucci, they couldn’t have given less of a care about us despite spending a fortune in their terrible excuse for a rooftop bar. Serious service improvements needed to match the standards of other rooftop bars in the city. What a waste for having such nice decor and skyline views. Will never ever be back.

He took his time on them which I really appreciated as they can be an awkward cocktail to prepare when the bar is busy and we spoke after about how he enjoyed making them as it was such a good cocktail. Thanks Eric! It was a lovely evening spent watching the sunset over the river. My one suggestion would be to install automatic doors to the terrace?

It was not late by any means at this time and others were allowed to proceed upstairs. We were denied entry and all left to feel embarrassed and humiliated by the incredibly rude staff. I also complained to the manager on duety this evening but still I was told it was a security process. Determined to not let this ruin the night we proceeded back to STK to have some drinks. The bar men then added a service charge on to serve our own drinks at the bar ( baring in mind we had already paid £80 service charge for our table)  When questioning this we were told it’s only £15!!!  The staff are seriously lacking in customer service. It seems as though they are trying to be a high class luxurious venue but seriously failing. I have visited the highest level of service hotels across the world and the staff bend over backwards. Unfortunately this place has got it all wrong, by speaking to your customers appallingly it doesn’t make them want to try harder to be given entrance to your bar!

I will never ever return to this bar !',\n"," \"The setting, views, and atmosphere of this bar are fantastic - I have to say it's superior to other local rooftops including Aqua and The Trafalgar. If you find yourself with a guest of the hotel the staff make every accommodation to seat you at a table of your preference (inside or outside) and this I think makes the difference from other reviews I have read - and other experiences of frustration with waiting times.  The staff can be very busy with the numerous guests ordering cocktails, but of my many experiences; attentiveness is overall good if you have a degree of patience and understanding. What impressed me most is that irrelevant, the staff are friendly, happy, and the managers get involved with waiting and wiping tables - there seems to be a conscious team effort.

Attitude from a very rude little waiter in a grey suit as to where we should sit, stopping us from looking at the view, his behaviour was most odd.

I can honestly say we were not disappointed. Our reservation was at 5,30 p.m. and we had a choice of tables to pick from. We chose near the window but not outside. We had a glass of champagne (compliments of Radio Rooftop) and we chose a variety of dishes from the small bites menu, lamb cutlets, buttermilk fried chicken, 3 mini burgers and mushroom beignets with a bottle of Rioja red wine, followed by cognacs. Yes, it is a little expensive but I don't believe in being mean to myself when I am out and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. To round off the evening the 4 celebration desserts was presented with a candle for my boyfriends birthday - Thank you so much Tanya - very much appreciated. This is a venue I would definitely recommend and return to but do make sure you bring ID - this is a strict criteria for entry.\",\n"," \"Lovely view of London from the heart of the city. The place is actually really expensive but it's worth for a night.\",\n"," \"My husband and I had heard about this place from a colleague so we thought we'd give it a go as was in the area for our wedding anniversary. We were greeted by door staff who were welcoming, lift staff and front of house staff. We hadn't made a booking but that was fine and shown to available tables, we decided to sit outside, despite a cooler evening under the heaters and there were blankets availble. We ordered olives, chips and mini burgers which all tasted great and an espresso martini, a ME Fizz (which i loved and it came with candyfloss!) and a Scotch bramble. All cocktails were incredibly made and full of flavour. All staff we came across were friendly and helpful, I would definitely recommend this place to friends and would visit again!\",\n"," 'My husband and i celebrated our 15 year anniversary in London last week and as our usual rooftop bar is currently closed for refurbishments we decided to try this one as we had heard some good things about it. It didnt disappoint. We went for lunch and we were lucky enough to have quite nice weather, bit chilly but the sun was shining. The staff put the outside heaters on for us too and it was so lovely sat outside, nice and warm with such fantastic views of London. The staff were very friendly and chatty and happy to help. We ate the burger sliders each and shared some chips, the food was lovely and really quite filling. It had a nice atmosphere and after lunch we had a look round the bar and took in all the views. Again staff happy for us to have a look around and even took some pictures for us. We really enjoyed our experience and will definitely look at returning. Highly recommend.',\n"," \"Radio's outdoor terrace is fab for cocktails - great views of London. Not so high as to reduce the city below to tiny ants, yet high enough to afford a view stretching from Tower Bridge to Big Ben. Cocktails are well crafted and properly prepared, staff friendly and fairly efficient. Plenty of heat lamps to make sitting side bearable in winter. But what's with the surreal security arrangements? The dedicated entrance involves not just showing an ID card, but to have that card scanned by some thug-like security guard into their computer system. My partner and I went to have drinks for his 65th birthday - I am only a few years younger. Why the scan of an ID card? What happens with that personal info? Do they know something I don't about the guests who drink there? It really is over the top and sort of thing that makes me not want to return.\",\n"," 'The Radio Roof top bar is a great entertainment sanctuary that offered style & great atmosphere.

Service was a little slow but then its primarily cocktails being served which always take longer and it was very busy. Tried a few cocktails each and the sliders & triple cooked chips which were delicious. We'd also advised we were celebrating a birthday and anniversary so it was a lovely touch to have little extra treats brought out. I read a lot of reviews about the staff but everyone was friendly. Sadly, some of the other clientele were more than a little on the pretentious side though and I'm not sure I'm a fan of the overall ambience of the place as a result.

We arrived and the girls in the group were fine to enter but our male friend was told he was too casual. This wasn’t the case especially as other men were in double denim and trainers (obviously the rules don’t apply to the wealthy).  The supervisor came out to say ‘the new manager was looking for a specific type of look’ so if my friend could be more ‘elegant next time that would be great’ but he would let him in on this occasion. When we pointed out the lack of consistency to enforcing the rules we were told ‘the word I think your looking for is thank you’. I didn’t appreciate being spoken to in this way. The only thing nice about the atmosphere is the view. However, by this point my mood was ruined by condescending and patronising staff who have a superiority complex.

Im not a 20 or 30 something with a big budget and probably on the way to a club or making a night of it with copious \"champs\" ..

I dont feel the need to go to a bar in my best party clothes (smart is good and required but not club clothes) and I certainly dont feel the need to have a bit of a dance as I walk past the DJ and at random times as the next dance track blasting through the bar temporarily makes any other form of communication impossible. (next time Id take a pad and write notes to my wife it would make things a lot easier). This gets INSANELY busy but considering the location Im not surprised.  If you want a table do like us and book ahead otherwise \"youre on the list\" at virtually any time and especially after dark Drinks are expensive as youd expect in this type of place but its a captive audience for this type of place so to be expected.

Despite it being cold and raining we were able to sit outside on the roof with a glass of champagne and simply divine Malbec. There was a heater and a canopy and the views were fabulous across Somerset House to the Thames with the Shard and the London Eye in view.

Then there was leaving - one small lift that the entire bar had to use to leave. No security to manage a fraught situation of very drunk people jostling to ‘jump the queue’ for the lift - whilst staff stood around, and didn’t respond to three requests to assist.

On arrival, we were ushered to some low Poolside type furniture and coffee tables and told that was our table (for our long lunch). This table was outside and it happened to be approximately 1° so absolutely freezing, it would also mean we would be eating lunch off our laps as the coffee tables were so low. When we asked where our actual table was we were told they don’t take bookings for 10 to which my friend pulled out her email to show them the confirmation of our booking for 10 people! Two of our friends were unfortunately ill so our booking was down to 8. The lady who was eating us said she could pull some tables together again these were small circular bistro style tables spread across two booth like seating areas so the group would have been divided. We were out for a long lunch and didn’t really want this so feeling like we were being a pain but wondering where else we could go for lunch on Saturday at short notice we asked if they had any more seating to which they put us outside again in an area with no heaters in the freezing cold. This just wasn’t what we signed up for when we booked to come to Radio bar. The views were amazing but the service was awful and we were made to feel like an inconvenience even though we were very polite and it was them that had messed up our booking. We did not end up having lunch there and unfortunately none of us will go back there in the future. There are plenty of places in London with beautiful views and fantastic customer service.

We ended up at a restaurant opposite where they couldn’t do enough for us:)',\n"," \"Sunday afternoon at 4:45pm was surprisingly busy will all outside tables taken by 5:15pm Views are good, and the patio heaters and blankets make outside seats very popular. Of course, as an outside area, smoking is permitted (would have been at least a 4/5 if smoke free), and the glazing and covered areas capture stale cigarette smoke too well. Service was slow, but accurate. Prices are not cheap, but you are paying for an element of exclusivity. No idea why a passport is needed for someone who is clearly well over 21!!

I have visited many of the top bars in the world and just found that this place a massive disappointment from the moment we arrived. Very patronising and rude lift guy who obviously enjoys his little bit of power. I feel the management should take a closer look at his behaviour as they cannot be aware of the damage he is inflicting on the reputation on this bar. (I have just read the other complaints). We were re-directed to the outside entrance the other door staff were extremely welcoming and pleasant.  Once inside, loved the terrace and view but that was the only thing I enjoyed about my visit. My sister ordered drinks at the bar and was told that if we ordered doubles our next round would work out cheaper. When she enquired how that would work out? He couldn’t explain!!! We stuck to singles. Second round she saw the barman go to other end of bar and use the dregs out of old tonic bottles for our G&Ts rather than open new bottles. She asked for fresh ones. We left after this and made our way out in the lift downstairs to be faced with attitude lift man shooing us out like cattle to the exit. Surprised that a brand like ME allows this behaviour to continue.

I'm always happy to add my own tip, however, when we haven't got a table or even a chair and we're waiting for our drinks at the bar and being served by a man who looks like he's sucking lemons and doesn't make us feel welcome at all; I can't understand what the service is that I'm paying for!

On our very fleeting trip to London recently to celebrate a 40th birthday, we made a special trip across the city in search of this venue, looking forward to enjoying the views, which I believe are spectacular. However, the very rude girl standing next to the lift looked us up and down with disgust and advised us the bar is ‘residents only’ and just like that we were ushered away….  Firstly, it’s not residents only – that’s a fact. Secondly, no human being should ever treat another in this way. It is absolutely despicable customer service and I am shocked that the Melia group allow a bar in one of their establishments to be operated in this way. I have stayed in Melia hotels and I am a member of the rewards scheme. I have also visited and stayed in numerous other high end hotels, restaurants and bars, and I have never experienced such treatment. Thirdly, we weren’t flouting any dress code (we were smartly dressed having just been to the theatre) and we are well educated, professional people who would happily have spent a considerable amount of money in this establishment, if we had been given the opportunity.  The management really need to get a handle on this issue. Perhaps we are just the wrong side of thirty and don’t meet Lift Lady’s idea of what their customers should be (I’m thinking perhaps TOWIE, Made in Chelsea, reality star wannabes….). Lift Lady - please stop looking down your nose at people wanting to spend their money and enjoy the views in this venue. You are no better than anyone else and they are no better than you, treat people with the respect you would expect to receive yourself. Management - you really need to train your staff in customer service. Reading other reviews on here, this treatment is clearly far from being a one off and it needs to stop. Lift Lady ruined a birthday. We certainly won’t be returning and have already advised friends, family and colleagues to stay well clear.',\n"," 'This bar is most definitely worth a visit. It feels so exclusive and secretive. Very pricey but worth it just for the views!',\n"," 'Average bar with a pedantic entry policy requiring photo ID and rude door staff.

Once out of the lift, we were met by yet another searly security man who stopped us for information as to why we thought we could go in but the girl at the desk seemed to be expecting us. By this time we were severely pissed off and I should say that at no time were our bags checked, which if you are going through such a ridiculous screening process, you would expect and strangely, had that happened, we would have been fine with it all.  The view is lovely but there are better places in London to drink with views. Service is abrupt and payment taken when you are about halfway through your averagely good but expensive cocktail.

Stay clear of Radio definitely not worth the money.',\n"," 'I booked Radio Rooftop Bar a few weeks ago for a birthday surprise for my boyfriend and unfortunately had to cancel and make a complaint on TripAdvisor due to my booking not being handled well. The directing manager, Andy, contacted me directly and completely rectified what had happened. Not only did we manage to get the date and times we had originally been promised, we were placed on a table with a perfect view of the city. The drinks were delicious and the entertainment was spot on for their Halloween weekend! We were both very satisfied with our night! Thank you again to Andy and the help of his colleagues on making this a great night to remember. We will definitely be back!',\n"," 'I went for a date with my husband. The staff is unprofessional, snobbish and takes too long to take your order. The ambience is ok and the view is magnificent. However, the quality of the food and drinks is not worth your time. There are better places with this view in London!',\n"," 'Really good bar if you can get in. Booking is recommended.  Prices are on the steep side. £15 for a cocktail but it is central London I guess... Staff are very attentive and efficient. The cocktails were well made. ',\n"," \"The cocktails were very nice and the view was impressive but sadly this was overshadowed by poor customer service, especially from the most senior member of staff, the bar manager who was very rude. We were asked if we had a reservation which we didn't so were seated at the bar. It was a lovely sunny afternoon so we were disappointed there were no available tables outside since this was why we had chosen the bar. We did of course understand that management need to prioritise tables for guests who have reserved them so we took to our seats at the bar and ordered our cocktails.  We stayed about 40 minutes and during this time a large section of the seated area outside was not in use. On leaving I asked the bar manager why we couldn't have sat there. He explained the area was not open until after a certain time and that it was reserved and there would be a lot of work involved to open it up to guests present now to then make it useable afterwards for other guests. I found this disappointing logic, guest experience is not worth opening up the outside seating area because there is extra work involved? I asked what work this would entail beyond wiping tables and plumping a few cushions. He took offence at this point and called me rude but failed to provide any examples of the additional work involved. I appreciate not opening up the outside seating area may not be his decision in which case he should have explained he would pass my comments on to management. He could have handles the situation with professionalism, I would have expected this from a high end bar but received superior customer service at Weatherspoons. If this decision is that of General Manager Andrew Crofts, to quote Andy in response to another trip advisor review 'we do our best to accommodate quest request for table moves'. Is this doing your best? Could you do better? Considering the unique selling point of the venue is the view from the outside seating area, you must understand why guests who visit for this very reason, who don't get seated outside but witness empty seats for the duration of their visit are not getting the experience they are paying for?  Go somewhere else, anywhere else.\",\n"," 'Popped in here today at 12.30pm in hopes of just having drinks for an hour before a lunch on the river. We were shown to the lift up to the bar and treated so nicely by the staff. We were offered a table inside or some lovely outside settees, which we chose. It was fabulous with terrific views over London. We were given a tray of iced water while we waited for our drinks. Drinks were all super! Just wish we could have stayed longer but we enjoyed every minute and nothing bad to say at all. Thanks so much.',\n"," 'Having booked a table and being hotel guests we had no trouble getting seated. We had to state our room number and name and were guided to the express elevator. Arrived upstairs we were asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside, we chose outside. We got a seat and the waiter paid attention to us and we were served quickly. We don\\'t know if they have a menu with \"real meals\", the food we saw was quite bite sized. If that is the whole menu we would not advise to go there for a filling menu but the food was tasty. The cocktail was good and had a large amount of alcohol in it and was not watered down. The prices are on the expensive side but is is a very nice rooftop terrace in London with amazing views, so we guess the prices are normal for that standard. We had no issues with orders arriving late or staff being unfriendly or pretentious',\n"," 'Having left the Shard where we had lunch to celebrate my husbands 40th birthday we decided to take advantage of the September sun and go for a drink at the Radio Rooftop Bar.  Initially we thought it was a stunning building inside and our first interaction was with a guy who opened the cab door for us and then showed us the way.  Sadly we then encountered the \"lift lady\" she asked if we had a booking then proceeded to look me and my husband up and down from head to toe. Her face was full of disgust and I felt like Julia Roberts - like she was checking we had enough money or the right clothes to have an afternoon drink.  We entered the lift. She turned the key and left us to it. No comment like have a nice time, directions where to go etc. She was a disgrace and put us both off even being in the building.  We did have a lovely cocktail and beer but left after one as we chose to spend our money somewhere else. Someone were class, clothes and status was less important.  Such a shame as I know we could have had a fab afternoon.  She really needs a lesson in how to treat customers. Hopefully the \"lift lady\" manual can be updated to help her with these skills as they are clearly lacking. ',\n"," \"This iconic bar has continued to provide a gorgeous upmarket setting with views across the city. It's not cheap, but you get great service and the food is delicious. DJs start early evening making it a fun venue to be for the transition from day time to evening. I've popped in for cocktails and ended up staying all evening. I've also used it as a day time venue for meetings. It has an expensive feel without feeling too exclusive. Watch out for the dress code!\",\n"," 'A lovely sunny afternoon in the capital led to an impromptu search for an inner city beer garden or rooftop terrace. The search brought up the Radio Rooftop Bar and despite reading a couple of negative reviews (\"rude\", \"pretentious\", \"overpriced\" etc), I am always willing to give places the benefit of the doubt and pass judgement for myself so along with my sister thought it was worth a visit.  On arrival we were asked if we had a reservation, we said no, and without passing any further comment as to whether a reservation was actually needed we were shown onto the lift. Just behind us two other couples arrived and they too were asked if they had reservations, they didn\\'t either. I think we all had the same idea that we might not be able to get a seat but if we can then great, happy days.  Being the first people on the lift meant that we were the last people out and so the other two groups got served before us. There was nobody on hand to say who arrived first and nobody made any attempt to find out. I accepted this as an easy mistake to make but one that could have been easily averted by having a single member of staff take the lift with the new customers.  The bar service was not the quickest, I know cocktails take longer to make but the bar was far from busy and we were seated at the bar for around 15 minutes before we could place our order.  The cocktails were very good, and although a bit pricey I don\\'t mind paying more if the overall experience is a good one. Sadly the quality of the drinks was overshadowed by a business model that dismisses the casual impromptu visitor. We asked to be seated outside on the terrace and we were told that was not possible, unless something became available. There were seats available, but we were not allowed to use them. Apparently, those empty seats are not allowed to be used until after 7pm, so having a booking isn\\'t even going to guarantee you a seat. The staff orders were clear but completely devoid of any reasoning and rationale. I hadn\\'t even decided whether I wanted to stay for another cocktail before the bill was put in front of me (I guess the staff were a step ahead of me). I put my card on the tray provided. Another 15 minutes passed before my payment was accepted and I could finally leave. There was another couple sat to my right hand side that had also been kept waiting to place their order. At a snails pace, their order was taken and I wished them a better experience than what I had. It\\'s a nice modern bar, the view is very good, and the drinks were good, sadly my own experience of the customer service was not. Aside from the service being slow, no effort was made to make the customer feel valued and welcome. I would probably still recommend this for large group bookings as I imagine they would be treated differently. If you\\'re just in a group of 2, I\\'d honestly forget it whatever the weather. ',\n"," 'I went for afternoon tea to Radio Rooftop with a friend on Saturday. What a wonderful experience! The whole process was very smooth, from the booking, to the friendly email reminder, the courteous greeting at the luxurious hotel reception on arrival... and throughout the our time there, with magnificent views over London while enjoying a delicious rendition of a favourite classic! Thoroughly recommended :)',\n"," \"Went here for birthday drinks, it's a lovely atmosphere with soft house music and warm during the winter. The staff are very friendly however the drinks are fairly pricey. \",\n"," \"The view is stunning at sunset across London, however, there was a reserved sign on every table outside and the vast majority of those tables stayed empty during our time there which was just over an hour. We did ask if we could sit down until the guests who had made reservations arrived, as one of our friends is pregnant, but we were told no as they were all reserved. It would be helpful to have a sign that stated the time the reservation is from to allow other customers the opportunity to enjoy the views and have a seat if no one is even sat there.  Coupled with this the service charge that is added to the bill was definitely not warranted. The bar tender got the order wrong and gave us a bottle of red wine instead of white and when I took it back he told me rudely that I'd ordered red. I wouldn't order red when I don't drink red. He then asked if it was the same price, I said I wasn't sure (it's not my job to know the price of the drinks) so he looked at the menu and said yes, they were the same price and swapped the red for a bottle of white.  When I looked at the menu to double check, the red was actually more expensive. So along with paying a service charge for bad service, I also got charged extra for the bar man getting my order wrong. I paid around £8 for absolutely nothing. My friends encouraged me to get this refunded but I felt too embarrassed to go back and complain. This is the issue with this bar, it is very pretentious and you are made to feel like an idiot if you complain (bar man adamantly telling me I ordered red wine when I don't drink red wine). If I had been sat at a table and had asked for table service I would be more than happy to pay a service charge, providing they got my order correct. However, to hand over a bottle of wine, manage to get that wrong and then blatantly lie about the price difference and not refund this, accepting a service charge is quite frankly disgusting and very bad customer service. \",\n"," \"We ve been yesterday night for a friend birthday  My friend was already inside cos she went early to have a table .

Also make sure you have a picture ID with you as this will be required before allowing you in and your name etc will be logged into their computer system before you are allowed to take the elevator up.

If you are not then unfortunately there's not much point in going.  The cocktails are approximately £14 and are average.  Service is poor to say the least. Staff are inattentive and somewhat rude. We ordered chips and waited for 30mins before we had to ask a waiter how long they would take to arrive to which he apologised and said he would find out and then never returned. We asked for the bill numerous times and it never came. We eventually got fed up of waiting and paid at the bar.  Overall, we were disappointed as the service did not live up to the exception of a rooftop cocktail bar in central London. \",\n"," \"I came here for work drinks. They were rude to me upon arrival, and even worse to my boss when he arrived. Again rude when I left. The food and servers were lovely though.

Book the booth in VIP área for very exclusive treatment, highly recommended',\n"," 'Booked more Hanna month ago from South Africa and was looking forward to one of the best rooftop venues in London. Table was booked for 18:00-20:00 and due to bad weather and traffic thought we would be 20 mins late. So at 17:45 (15 minutes before booking time and whilst in taxi) phoned the Radio Rooftop to explain that we were running late but would definitely be there around 18:20. The obnoxious guy on the phone said that they could not keep our table more than 15 minutes and it was tough luck if we got there Late as they were full and the next people booked would take out table. I tried to explain that was the reason why I phoned but he said there was nothing he could do and put he phone down.  As it happened we arrived at 18:15 and once there had great service, good music and a great selection of cocktails and drinks.  I would have rated this 5 stars for ambience and location and service except for the telephone experience. It is for that reason that I would not recommend it to friends or colleagues and not go back.  Sad because it is a great place spoilt by pettiness and inflexibility by the person that answers the phone. ',\n"," 'Extremely badly managed. It is forbidden to make any picture of the city from a certain time at night, or you risk to be thrown away like a bad boy. There are definitely far better places to have a drink in London (and elsewhere!)',\n"," \"We arrived at the entrance to find two staff, smartly dressed all in black, pompously clutching their iPad booking system and guarding themselves against customers with ropes. They had clearly been trained in the art of looking hugely superior and avoiding any possible eye contact, their noses stuck high up in the air fearing perhaps that one of their potential customers might make a bad smell. We waited in line until eventually we were worthy of being noticed and were told we need photo ID to enter. For the avoidance of doubt, I don't mind having to show ID (they set the rules, although I do think it's rather unnecessary), but I do object to being treated like scum.\",\n"," \"Having lived in London for five years I've heard on occasion people speaking highly of the Radio Rooftop bar, so decided to book as the precursor to an evening out with colleagues. Upon arrival the entrance staff left us waiting, preferring instead to talk amongst each other. As there was no one in line I would have expected a greeting within seconds, this did not happen. After a long wait for the lift we were shown to our table on the terrace. After seating we were left unattended to for around 10-15 minutes, no one seemed interested in taking our order, so eventually we summoned a member of staff.  A short while later it started to rain, annoyingly our table appeared to be the only one not covered by the retractable canopy. We grabbed our food and drinks and asked where we could go, assuming that there would be a backup plan in place as London is famed for it terrible weather. Instead, we were met with bemused staff who didn't really know what to do. The temporary solution was to sit at another table with a group of strangers, with no offer of assistance from the staff to help carry our multiple food and drinks - we did that ourselves. Ten minutes later we were directed to a table inside, again, no offer of help to carry our food and drinks. After being seated for a third time we were not approached by staff for another 20 minutes, again summoning someone to order. At this stage we had been in the bar for 1 hour 15 minutes and had only ordered one bar snack (between 5 people) and one drink each. As the service seemed to be infrequent and inattentive we decided to order multiple drinks at a time as we were conscious the two hour limit was fast approaching. At this point it became apparent that the only way to get service offered to you is to spend a great deal of money. In the lead up to our bill reaching £600 the service could not have been better. All in all, the ambiance is nice, cocktails are delicious, bar snacks are great, however this establishment is seriously let down by the unnecessary and undeserved arrogance of its staff and terrible service.  I feel sick at having spent over £600 here as there are many better alternatives in London far more deserving of your time and money. I wouldn't visit again and would discourage others from doing so.\",\n"," 'Visited rooftop last sat 10th June for drinks n brunch !!

Outdoor areas need to be booked. The extra security and dark entrance corridor adds to the excitement on a first visit. The staff were very pleasant and my mini-burgers and chunky fries were delicious. My wife wasn't so pleased with her ox cheek tacos however.

You are greeted by another host , we did not book but it was mid week at about 5pm ,so a table inside the bar wasn't a problem but all the outside sitting was reserved so I would recommend always booking in advance . Delicious cocktail about £14 each, we were going somewhere else for dinner but the tapas on the bar menu looked delicious and reasonably priced.

Her robotic repetitive refusal was so annoying as I explained I had phoned earlier and was assured access and not even looking at me when she was talking to me.

The evening was pretty cool later on, but it was just fabulous to be outside looking over London town.

When we arrived at the desk we were asked if we had a reservation which we didn't but she said it was fine and we could go up anyway.

The service on the whole was great - we felt very secure with the security procedures downstairs in the lobby and all bar staff seemed friendly although we did have to keep trying to catch their eye to order more drinks which they could be more proactive with.  I think the wine list is from £38/bottle so not the best value in London (enjoyed much better wine for much less elsewhere) however it is a really great spot to enjoy views, cocktails (from £12 I think) and a chilled out trendy vibe!

It's nothing to do with age it's a security thing. Dress code which includes NO trainers, so if you have been walking the streets of London all day in trainers, they will not let you in. Once up in the bar, you will fight to get a table as they let others reserve areas/tables. So, there may be loads of free tables but you will be standing unless you sit down at a reserved table and they will come and move you. They should not let people reserve as it's not fair for the ones that are up there already buying drinks. The main thing that bus me about this place is the 20% tip they add on everything. Even if you go upto the bar yourself and order the cheapest bottle of wine for £33 they charge you £40. You are not given a choice, they expect it and unless u r going to make a massive fuss about it, that is what u r going to pay.  That said, it's had a refurb and is a lovely place to have a drink and look over London. But take a big wedge of money with you . I went with family but this is really for office people I think, with Company's paying the bill. Normal people wouldn't be up there all night long drinking.  I did enjoy it though but want to leave what 'I' want as a tip, as 20% is ridiculous.\",\n"," 'We phoned to book a table and was told that we need to spend minimum of £50 per person. We only wanted a couple of drinks, but decided to try anyway. We were treated very courteously by the staff and a table was found for us.

I then asked the bouncer outside if these people will be seated inside as they have made a reservation and his response was 'wherever there is space'. I then called up Radio bar on the spot to ask if they had a reservation and how their information is contradicting with each other. We finally gained entry and was then told at reception that to sit outside we needed a reservation. After finally getting my point across, we got a table outside and another waitress came up to us and said we have to return the table in 45 mins as we didn't make a reservation.

They really took care of me in the build up to the main event. Calling me regularly to make sure everything was going to plan, if there was anything else I needed from them etc.  They made me feel like I was the only guest present at the venue.

The birthday girl managed to leave her purse at the previous destination. I was extremely polite and humble with the door lady who was curt and rude beyond belief. It was made very clear that it was non-negotiable to not have the ID so we had to take a cab round trip back to claridges to collect the purse. However 5 minutes later another male member of our party arrived without ID and miraculously managed to get in. Clearly it's not so unnegotiable. 40 minutes later returned with purse. Got upstairs and no staff seemed available so had to wonder around to find our table. Found my friends in the back corner. The table had no lighting, pitch black, and no heating. Considering it's march in the U.K. I expected a heater. Apparently they ran out of gas. The champagne I asked to come out as a surprise was already on the table. My friends brought balloons and poppers to surprise the birthday girl which they obviously used. 10 minutes after our arrival a waitress came over and address the entire group making it very clear she was very annoyed and I can only describe what she did as chastising us and telling us off. It was extremely cringey. I had no idea poppers were not allowed. She told us it was a 5 star hotel - I'm not sure what relevance that had but I would note that most 5 star hotels are a lot more accommodating of their customers and far more polite. We apologised and offered to clear the confetti up and she continued to be rude and stomped off. There was absolutely no music and no vibe also. Drinks expensive and not very nice - cocktails watery. Complete waste of time - jumped up pretentious awful staff. The only waitress that had any manners with the lovely East Asian lady who was a star. The rest need customer service training ASAP. Won't ever return. \",\n"," \"Service good with definite room for improvement and communication from the kitchen. I find it is always good to receive the correct ingredients that are ordered. Example sweet potato fries on menu regular received, no communication to the server!!! Reuben sandwich came without sauerkraut, one of the main ingredients, very disappointing. Daisy our waitress took good care of us and if she had not done so our afternoon would have been a disaster. Chablis and cocktails were very good. Tall mixologist making the cocktails was on the ball, shame he was chewing gum. Booking essential, views excellent, don't book an event there as the sales staff will eat your left over food when you leave, very unprofessional. Personally they should have assisted the staff turn the space around as the venue was getting busy.

We arrived and waited for a member of staff to speak to regarding where we should sit. After a couple of minutes of being passed by we decided to go and seat ourselves. There was one seating area left outside, inside was empty, there were blankets on the floor and thrown over the seats, along with food crumbs and cigarette burns on the cushions. The table was also dirty and sticky. We waited nearly 15 minutes before someone came to take our order. I was just about to go to the bar myself. We ordered a jug of your vodka cocktail (£45) which arrived fairly quickly but was pretty weak. We were also told it contained fresh pear but was in fact apple. Nobody bothered to clean the table. The jug was dumped in front of us for us to pour our own drinks and the waiter disappeared not to be seen again. We ended up having to go to the bar to pay the bill. We were in fact waiting to order another jug of cocktail but after waiting so long decided to move on to another place. When I was given the bill I discovered a 12.5% service charge which amounted to just under £6.00. I paid this because I didn’t want to make a fuss in front of my mum. She took the bill off me to have a look and noticed the service charge and couldn’t believe that I had paid it. She then commented to the member of staff who took our payment that we are more than happy to pay service charge but actually expect to get some service for that charge. She pointed out that the waiter could have at least poured our drinks. To which the member of staff shrugged and said ‘Sure, I can see your point there.' And then disappeared.

So you can sit and enjoy amazing views for as little as £1.50 - worth it to me! The bar itself has a buzzing atmosphere, but the views from inside aren't very good, there are outdoor heaters outside and its worth sitting outside for the views!

We had dined at the Ivy and been to watch saint Joan on the west end before deciding to end the evening with a night cap.

Having also read of the dress code on line I felt assured it would be a suitable venue for my wife's birthday, unfortunately this was not the case. Upon arrival I can only describe the setting as reminiscent of the film Boys in the hood or perhaps a youth club in Peckham. There were two large groups of youths dominating both seating areas on either side of the bar. Their attire included trainers (not allowed under website dress code) and scruffy jeans hanging below the groin area so their underwear was on full view. The other table opposite had similar scruffy attire/sports wear and trainers on. A couple of the group also had black eyes and one a full plaster across the face clearly from fighting. I felt uncomfortable in this environment and the staff appeared to feel the same. The security guards appeared to pander to the two groups and didn't intervene when glasses were smashed and noise levels from the group of about thirty became intolerable. The security staff did however berate individuals for going out onto the balcony to photograph somerset house (stating it's closed), a quite natural occurrence considering this is a rooftop bar to enjoy the view. The bar staff were so busy fussing around these groups that my wife had to go and collect our drinks that had been sat on the bar for several minutes.

We were treated just like any other guest as far as I could see, although we did look slightly out of place in our casual daytime gear by the time we left about 19:30. No judgement.

No less than a metre from where the bar was only to find out that in a harry houdini like moment, my mojito had disappeared from the bar!!! When i asked the barman what had happened to my drink (barman number 1) he said when the drinks are paid for they become your responsibility! to which i laughed, ok, get me the manager please. Barman number 2 had clearly swiped it out of his rage for having to go and wash up a few more glasses but however without proof i calmly and embarrassingly in front of my clients spoke to the manager - i am not sure what internal grievances are going on between these two but i have just been the victim of a ridiculous situation ending in my mojito being swiped before id taken a sip! He immediately instructed a girl called Daisy to make two mojitos - which she did, and then in an almost final act of bartender defiance, she tried to tell me that her manager had only asked her to make one for me so gave me one, whilst the other one sat on the bar!!!!! literally 2 seconds later, the manager himself appeared with the second mojito and apologised to me. I then saw him go inside and blast the bar staff verbally. Heres a tip for the bar tenders at Radio - if you dont like your job, go and get another one you bunch of miserable petty fools - well done to the manager, you attempted to handle the situation as it should been handled only to be thwarted by your staff.  I will not return to this place ever again, neither will my customers, nor my circle of friends. Customer experience is king to return custom. Poor effort.',\n"," 'I went along for a work lunch at the Radio Rooftop in the ME Hotel in the Strand. The restaurant has amazing views looking over London you can see such buildings as the Gherkin and the Shard. The bar is impressive round and bright and they have a great outside area as well to have a drink which has comfy sofas to lounge on with heaters and blankets for the colder days/nights which is very cosy.  However as for the restaurant side of things I would not recommend Radio Rooftop as the food was appalling. When we first arrived our table was not even set out so they had to move tables together and dress the table which was odd considering we had a booking. One of the tables also kept on sinking as had a mechanism in where you could make it higher or lower. When it came to the food I ordered the seafood linguine and literally waited for it for approx 30 minutes. The portion was small and the pasta and seafood was luke warm, tasteless and the chillies even had no taste to them no heat nothing and the pasta was sticking together practically. One persons seafood linguini did not have any clam meat just empty shells. However everyone else had ordered a burger and I must admit that did look good big, chunky and juice with a brioche bun but the chips were the long frozen type fries not hand cut chips which was disappointing to see but they tasted nice. For dessert we ordered the apple crumble again a very long wait until it came to the table and when it did it looked more like soup with apple floating around in it with a scattering of crumble. Could not eat it as was soup and the small amount I did slurp up like soup tasted of burnt caramel. The waiter apologised and then came back and told us it was because there was an accident in the kitchen what the accident was I don’t know but worrying to think why our crumble looked like the way it did. We sent all crumbles back. Even though the staff was apologetic and nice I would not go back for the food at all as below standards and the food took way too long to come out and when it did was luke warm anyway.  I am rating this place 2 out of 5 as went along for the food in the restaurant.  However even though I would not go back for there for food I would possibly go back for a drink or two to experience the amazing views on offer.',\n"," \"Stayed at the hotel. Visited the rooftop twice. Nice atmosphere. Drinks were great. If you are expecting cheap drinks don't go. These are handmade cocktails worth the cost. Fabulous view of the city. If you stay in the hotel they do reserve space for you as a curtesy which is nice seeing as though it does get busy. Would definitely stop here.\",\n"," \"Excellent time. We went to Radio Rooftop to an engagement party. It was held outside on the roof which is partly covered, there were heaters that gave off enough heat to beat off the cold. The area was specially booked for us. Sadly we couldn't hear the music inside but the rooftop has stunning views of London with SKATE just across the street. We were moved to another area of the rooftop at around 10 because of noise pollution for surrounding residents. The staff were attentive and the champagne flowed. When we left there we're approx 100 lined up to get in, its good but not enough that I would wait out in the cold. Prices are high for drinks 1 G&T and one pink G&T £27. \",\n"," 'Went there with some friends after a long time I have not set foot here as last time I was left very disappointed by the service...well, guess what? Same disappointment again! Such a pity because the place is nicely located and has wonderful views but it is always a struggle to find a place, waiters are more anxious at your shoes than at delivering a good service! they kept pressing us for more orders while we were waiting for more firends to come (and we were already with a drink in our hands!!), they brought us the wrong order, broke a glass and kept telling us the table was reserved and we had to vacate it..which they stopped saying the moment we placed a large order! Then the table was magically not reserved any more.. Quite sad they want to keep a chic clientele but actually they are offering far from a chic service.',\n"," \"I've always heard fab things about Radio Rooftop. I decided to venture out. We had no issues getting in, just a 5 min wait on the door. Upstairs is fab with amazing views, however, I couldn't understand why they roped off most of the actual rooftop. It was a relatively warm Saturday evening and only a small section of the rooftop was being used. So everyone was squished into a small space. The drinks were okay, the service was quite slow though, for a Saturday night I expected more. The continuous instrumental music was annoying though. I would love to come in the day\",\n"," \"We visited radio rooftop for my birthday and I must say the atmosphere was brilliant  The cocktails were lovely and I felt we're reasonably priced considering where we were.

Friendly bar staff, sophisticated venue design and we didn't get any food, but it looked like a nice place to eat! The views were incredible and the outdoor seating area was very cosy - it was a plus that they had heaters outside so wasn't too cold. The drinks were on the pricy side but we paid for the experience.

We have stayed at the hotel before which is of a reasonable standard but after this demonstration of incompetence we will not be using any of the facilities again.',\n"," 'We had a conference at the ME hotel and booked an area to have drinks before dinner. The view is spectacular and we felt very looked after.',\n"," 'You just have to try the Radio Roof Top Great Buzz and what a great view  Thanks guys for a great lunch time',\n"," 'Visited radio rooftop on the 31st October for drinks. We booked a table over the phone, the reservations lady was incredibly rude and disinterested. On arrival, we were impressed by what is an undisputed incredible review. However, we waited over half an hour before we were asked what drinks we would like, and then continued to wait over 15 minutes for a bottle of champagne to arrive. This was then followed by waiting an excessive amount of time for a second drinks order to be taken. We also ordered some olives and almonds which never arrived, and when our bill came we were informed that they had run out. The bill included a service charge, which we paid, but which was not warranted by the service. Ultimately, the views are beautiful, but for a pricey drinks list with appalling service, I would opt for one of the many other rooftop bars nearby.',\n"," 'Fabulous views and atmosphere. They make a delicious Virgin Mojito and spicy Bloody Mary. Very trendy and fun.',\n"," 'A great London rooftop bar with good cocktails and nibbles. It can be a little windy on the rooftop.

Service, especially with the bar being quiet, was brilliant, prompt and of a high standard. I suspect this bar is very similar to Madison (and in my opinion better than) in that it's far better enjoyed during the day compared to the evening when it's rammed and often packed full of well, you can guess where I'm going with this...\",\n"," \"Was really looking forward to coming here so it was a great disappointment. We were staying in the hotel so decided to go for early evening drinks. The bar was really busy and didn't have an exclusive feel to it, which I thought it would. Anyway, had a couple of drinks and headed off out, to return later that evening. It had quieted down around 10:30 and we were shown to a table. After waiting 10 to 15 minutes for service, with no sign, we decided to leave.\",\n"," \"We stumbled across this bar when visiting London - we didn't book but arrived at about 12:15 on a Saturday and managed to get a big comfy sofa outside. It was a gorgeous sunny day, the staff were friendly and the music was great. We enjoyed some bar snacks but nothing from the main menu so can't comment on the food. Drinks were reasonable, especially given the location. I'll go back again. \",\n"," 'Was hosted together with an international business group by local partners at this venue.

My only thumbs down would be the fact that I had two virgin coladas, the first one was not good at all, I actually felt a bit cheated; but the second made by another mixologist was probably one of the best virgin coladas Ive ever had. So careful, could be a hit and miss when it comes to the drinks. Apart from that pretty cool place.',\n"," 'This place is great to come, you are welcomed in the hotel entrance by friendly staff, the ground floor bar looks amazing so will try next time. so you head of up in the lift to this bar and again a friendly welcome awaits you . Amazing views of the city and the Thames, mine was not the best day to come as started to rain but soon cheered up. The brunch menu was good , my only complaint is not a lot of choice, hopefully in time will increase, but the food I had was fab especially the chip in gravy (please add big bowl of them to menu). I can imagine the evenings here are great fun and it is on my hit list. Go and enjoy',\n"," \"Really chilled out start to our day for ladies of a certain age. Lunch time fun in the winter sun - enjoying the range of Gin & Tonics on offer including Monkey 47. Only downside to the G&Ts were them being served in a large wine glass as opposed to a proper gin glass - it makes the difference for me personally. As we were fairly early, the bar was pretty busy and service was slow - our age may have been against us on that one too! When the alternative are lots of lovely young ladies, the ones with the money were ignored! It's a cross that me and my golden girls will have to bear and would definitely go back!\",\n"," 'I used to really like this bar It still has good views, good music and the table service is efficient But it just looks run down and the inside table layout sucks  For a bar that clearly makes a lot of money it would take much of an effort to do it up and make it a bit more special',\n"," \"We've visited the Radio Bar on a number of occasions now and it's a great venue for either business or pleasure. Either way the ambience is second to none, location is brilliant and staff are great.  The Gin cocktails were well made and there is a great choice of speciality gins.

Good crowd, nice relaxed atmosphere. \",\n"," \"I met my drinks supplier Venus at this launch He had a table and we waited for 40 mins to be served at our table by a waitress My colleague went over to the bar twice to complain that no one had attended to us and they said they would send someone over to us It was absolutely disgraceful service  They need to get more waiting staff or allow customers to purchase at the bar as clearly they could not cope For a busy venue like this I cannot believe the service as it's a beautiful rooftop\",\n"," \"Nice view.

There was little choice so we all ordered the Steak, Egg and chips which again another 40 mins to arrive, the food was cold and the steak full of fat and 5 chunky chips yes really 5!!! The table took over an hour to be cleared, we ordered another drink and the desert menu but again no sign of any of it, got so fed up we'd been there 3 1/2 hours at this point and decided to go somewhere else for desert, we asked for the bill which came quiet quickly with a £35 service charge added !! We complained to a waiter who was very rude telling us that if we had sat in a different area of the restaurant we would have been served quicker (absolutely ridiculous)!! The manager then intervened and reduced the bill by £100 including the service charge , at that point the other drinks we had ordered with deserts turned up, needless to say we left frustrated and upset that we had been treated this way in what was supposed to be a surprise birthday celebration, we will not be returning. One good point, the views are amazing !!\",\n"," 'Everything was just right. Serivce is great, food is delicious and the view is not too shabby either. We went for afternoon tea and it was one of the best I have had in London. Will definately go back.',\n"," 'Great views - We had a cabana at the back of the terrace, and the views were incredible. It was a late Friday afternoon, and we were there as a DJ started playing some chilled out music to bring the evening in.

My friend Francesco always book me in, one of the best host I've ever met! Feel like home now\",\n"," \"We had afternoon tea at Radio Rooftop and it was great! The view is sensational and we were blessed with good weather: even when it rained for a short while the staff instantly extended the canopy so we did t get at all damp and offered blankets in case we were cold. From the minute we arrived our waiter Richard couldn't do enough to help us, explaining the menu fully and talking us through each of the sandwiches and cakes when they arrived. The cocktails were lovely and the sandwiches novel and tasty - I particularly liked the watermelon, feta and olive. The fruit salad came with earl grey mouse and felt more like desert than a palate cleanser! The waiters kept our teapots full and hot throughout. The variety of cakes and pastries was fantastic. As it was a birthday lunch Richard bought over doughnuts with a candle which was a lovely touch! We were so full we had to bring the doughnuts home with us. We didn't feel at all rushed and stayed far longer than we thought we would enjoying the tea and the view.

To be fair when I made a booking they set out their stool by advising it was a £75pp min spend - in a 2 hour window. This turned out not to be quite the challenge we expected. We had cocktails to start, then moved on to the cava and 'tapas'. The food was good quality - but such small portions. When our 2 hour slot ended - we were able to stay on our table. As the evening went on there was music and it became more of a bar than a restaurant. The atmosphere was good - loved the Wimbledon style roof that slides over when it rains. The service was ok, but not very friendly. Good views - but personally I won't be rushing back. \",\n"," 'The view from this place is amazing.

So a group of us decided to come to Radio Rooftop as it was such an amazing day.  We were seated outside and the views are just amazing.  When I have been to other afternoon teas you can fill a little hungry afterwards but this one was huge! So much food, and it was all very tasty. As well as getting lots of cakes you also get scones with cream and jam - best scones I've had for ages. And just when you think you are finished a white chocolate ice cream with frozen strawberries. To make it more worth your while you should have the Afternoon Tea with the cocktail/mocktail. Cocktails were lovely and so refreshing especially in the sunshine. It does get realty hot up there in the sun and I recall at some point the roof closed to shut out the sun (which was a blessing) Staff were very attentive and helped us along the way with the food (we had two vegetarians in the group) Would highly recommend the afternoon tea. Such a wonderful place. Great for people who are shopping and in the local area too.\",\n"," \"We, a group of 5 ladies, visited 11am on a beautiful Sunday morning and only one other table was in at the time, so it was lovely to have the place almost to ourselves. It also made for super attentive staff who were polite and helpful, substituting an item off the menu with no problem (due to dietary requirements). I had a Bloody Mary which hit the spot for a morning-after tipple - they make it to your liking - and my friends shared a bottle of wine. The brunch was delicious, lots of good options to choose from, and well-presented decent portions. The black pudding hash was very popular among our group, as was the croissant with avocado. I had the shakshuka which was different to any other that I've had, quite rich and saucy, but very tasty - I was not disappointed, however the egg which is supposed to be poached in the vegetables was actually just a fried egg laid on top.  Situated on the top of the ME hotel, you are greeted by the doorman who will direct you to the lifts/ reception just past the lobby with its striking chrome tube installations separating off the lounge area. We had no trouble with the dress code despite two of us wearing converse-like gym-shoes (on the whole we were quite casual with shorts, sandals and tees), however I can see that they might be a lot stricter on this rule should they wish. At the top you have great views over London, to the East you can see the Gherkin, Cheesegrater, Walkie Talkie etc and the Shard, and to the West you can see Big Ben. The rooftop has high quality furnishings, including sofas and a cabana to relax in. I often find these types of fancy places let themselves down by being too stuffy or clinical, rude service or poor portions or whatever, however I thought the pricing was very reasonable for the superb quality delivered here, and on this occasion could not fault the service. A 5* from me, just choose a nice day to visit to get the best experience.\",\n"," 'Main issue is the price of drinks is actually quite ridiculous. The view is great if you are able to sit on the balcony but otherwise really not worth the price. It came to £101 for 6 drinks, a small plate of tapas and some bread. First round we had £12-14 cocktails each and then second round just went for a spirit and mixer. The gin was £9 not including tonic and I actually do not think there was any gin in there as tasted like pure tonic water.  Lots of staff seemingly mingling around but have no idea who they were serving as we had to keep go to the bar to order food or drinks. Despite this we were whacked with a considerable service charge.  If service and drinks were good, I could understand the price due to location but bad service and average to poor drinks lets this place down.

However the food was not up to my standard, I came with three friends and we all had something different- every meal was presented very basic and not worth the money at all.

I'm a photography and wanted to take some good standard professional pictures however the food looked appalling! \",\n"," \"AVOID at all costs. Absolutely shocking bar.

We didn't have any issues getting in and were shown up politely and promptly.  I got the feeling that this is very much a place to be seen having fun, the focus being more on the being seen than the actual fun. We found the service to be very slow, however the waiting staff in the main were very pleasant and when one particular drink took what felt like forever the bar man gave it to us on the house. We visited during the day time and spent the afternoon, when the music started the place had more of a vibe, I think possibly it would be better to have it on during the day as it felt a bit stagnant at times.  We shared 2 bottles of prosecco, three glasses of wine, three main courses and some chips and two side salads and the bill came to £220 which seemed like a lot to me, with a large service charge for poor/ slow service.  I'm not sure that I will be rushing to go back but I'm glad i went. I think this place is quite marmite and people will either love it it hate it.

After being ushered up in the lift direct from the hotel lobby by the hostess (who used a walkietalkie to advise staff in the bar we were on our way) we were met by a chap who asked for our reservation details. The hostess using her walkietalkie was seemingly a waste of time. I gave our details, he looked up on the computer and said someone would show us to our table. We were left standing at the desk for around 10 minutes whilst staff came to and from the bar asking us if we were being taken care of. Each time I explained that we had been advised to wait for someone to show us to our table. Finally I asked a female staff member how long we would have to wait. She looked up my details on the computer and apologised and said she hadn't realised we had arrived! A bit of a farce. We had a lovely table outside and ordered a magnum of rosé. However when the wine arrived at our table it sadly wasn't magnum sized and I didn't notice until it had already been opened. We were given a free glass of champagne to apologise, but something you don't expect to happen when you're paying a 12% service charge. Experience was a bit disappointing.\",\n"," \"Decided to pop in here for a drink before checking into the Waldorf Hilton. Shoudn't have bothered!! It was a lovely sunny afternoon so it seemed a good idea at the time.

We ordered a couple of bottled beers but waited over 20 minutes for the waiter to return. He brought the bottles without glasses and my Husband asked him for glasses. Off he went and never came back. After 5 minutes my Husband went up to the bar and got me a glass. Eventually got the bill and again off he went wandering around. When asked for our change he still had the money in his hand which he showed us. Why had he not just gone to the bar paid the bill and got our change? It was not busy that afternoon so do not understand why the service was so slow. Paid the service charge grudgingly!!\",\n"," \"All I can say is disappointing , we had a reservation , hostess had no record of this, said we could sit inside but not outside, ordered a drink , sat for a while ordered another one, hostess came over and said we had to move, we asked why and she said u have no reservation , which we did, anyway she was incredibly rude , said it wasn't her problem , I said the right thing to do would be to leave us in table, she was having none of it, we cancelled our drinks and left, could it get over her attitude , think she may need to go to customer service !!! The impression she gave was that your bar was a pretentious and arrogant , whatever walk of life you are from you should be treated with respect , will I return again? Don't think so\",\n"," 'My friend told me about this restaurant so I decided to come for a cappuccino. And I was really surprised! The view was soo nice and the restaurant very exclusive.

Pros first: Very nice views, we were lucky to get a spot outside, the music kinda of like dance dance but very mainstream. generally nice crowed, it would fit for a date night or just hangout with friends. Cons: while the view is great the cocktails are overpriced for what they are - £14 each, which is the same price you'd pay at The Nightjar or any other top ranked bar. If you order at the bar prepare for a long wait, imho they are a bit understaffed  Overall a very nice atmosphere, I'd go back with friends on a warm eve.\",\n"," 'I have been here before and had a nice meal with my husband, some colleagues suggested here and I did warn them that they are very selective when you present yourself at the desk, when I went with my husband they turned away three lots of people in front of us and then showed myself and my husband straight through to an outside table. This visit the hostess looked us up and down and then said there were no outside tables as they were all reserved, she then proceeded to ask others behind us if they would like to sit inside or out, its so rude anyhow to do this but Gabrielle has perfected this art to a fine degree, she does also favour male customers. Sadly she was wrong in her assumption of us, we are make up artists for a well known tv company, have many celebrity clients and are always on the look out for places to take our clients, well I can assure you it won\\'t be here. We withheld the service charge and explained to her why. Her reply was \"I am never rude\", well I suggest she looks at some of the reviews on here and realises we are not the first to notice.  Avoid at all costs!',\n"," \"I am gutted I couldn't stay for longer. Lovely atmosphere and beautiful views. I can't wait to go back !!! \",\n"," \"I joined the queue outside the entrance of the Radio Rooftop Bar 6.15pm on a Monday before seeing a show at the West End. After queuing for 40 mins my friend and I made it to the entrance only to be told by the lady, who gave my friend a disparaging look down, that 'no trainers are allowed after 6 pm'. My friend by the way was wearing nice casual clothes and expensive trainers. Thumbs down for this place. If the trainer thing is true then why is there nothing on the website? Also, the door lady saw us in the queue and could have easily given us a warning, which could have saved us not only 40 minutes of waiting but also spared us from being treated in a condescending way.\",\n"," \"Disappointed to only be giving this bar 2 stars. After wanting to visit for a while, a friend and I finally had the opportunity to go for a drink and we left very underwhelmed. I got the impression that they've got a bit wrapped up in their own perceived 'status' (waiting behind a rope to even get in the door) and think they can get along on their views alone. The furniture doesn't look like it's been updated since it opened (very tired and cheap looking) and the bar definitely lacks any character or ambience. The cocktail was average. I have to agree with other reviewers when they call it pretentious. Other than the nice girl waiting by the lift and our waiter the other staff don't look like they've cracked a smile in a while and make you feel quite uncomfortable. Yes, the views are great but with more and more places opening offering the same they won't be able to get by on just that for much longer.

Cocktails are expensive but really nice!! One side had views of shard ect. ',\n"," \"This was our first visit and we went for afternoon tea. We were given a great selection of sandwiches and extra veggie ones were added for our non-meat eating guest. These were followed by scones with jam and cream, a most unusual fruit salad and then more cakes than we could possibly eat (the rest were boxed up for us to take home. I noticed everyone else was leaving with a box so we weren't the only ones who could not finish all the food). Little white chocolate ice cream lollipops finished off the meal. There is not a huge selection of teas but there were black, green and herbal ones so there was something for everyone. We were told this was a new venture for them and they were certainly trying there hardest to make it pleasant for us. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and she was given a plate of doughnuts with chocolate dip with a candle on top. There was a slight hiccup with the service and we had to wait quite a while after the sandwiches but we received full apologies and the rest of the meal was served very smoothly. Another slight hiccup with the bill which was put right immediately to everyone's satisfaction. I think the problems were just teething trouble with a new system and will be working perfectly in the future. Most enjoyable. The views over London are amazing. Unfortunately, it was raining and we couldn't eat outside but we could still enjoy the view.\",\n"," 'Visited previously numerous times in the evening but this was my first day time visit. Atmosphere is chilled with a DJ playing in the background, cocktails and light lunch from the brunch menu just what we were looking for.

One let down was the menu - not much choice and we waited over an hour for our food as the waiter forgot to place the order but minor disruption as we were enjoying the views and cocktails. Not for anyone on a budget but worthy of the prices for the view and quality of food and beverages. ',\n"," 'The atmosphere is upscale, not for the flipflop wearing crowd.

Hidden on top of a hotel in the busy Aldwych it offers and delivers great service, friendly staff, a variety of tasty food and as much tea as you want. We skipped the alcohol option. We'd only allowed ourselves one and three quarter hours and that was way too short to do justice to the delicious 'courses' served. We had to rush towards the end but were given what we couldn't eat as a take-away in a smart container which travelled well. We enjoyed the left-overs the next day. The roof top views are also wonderful and we were lucky in that it was a clear and sunny day.  It's not cheap but is ideal for a special celebration.

In terms of London rooftops it is nice. However, I guess I had some expectations that come along with being a hotel bar. On entry to the bar area we were presented with a strong smell of drainage which was so strong that you would not be able to sit inside and enjoy a drink there. We were lucky that we managed to do d a table in the outdoor area, however if we had not we probably would have left. Further to this I visited the ladies toilets which were a complete mess. I would not expect that of a high end hotel bar.  This place has potential however removal of the stench in the bar area and ensuring the toilets are clean at all times is important. Especially when you are charging a 15% service charge on all of your drinks.\",\n"," \"I visited Radio for the first time on a Saturday evening with friends. I booked a table in advance and we had cocktails and tapas from the evening menu. The food was ok, nothing amazing and the cocktails were good. But the service.....was horrendous! There was a minimum spend of £500 for our table and there was no way we would ever reach it with the slow service. I went to the bar in the end to try and get served and still ended up waiting around. I raised the issue with the manager and they removed our minimum spend but we would have been happy to pay if we could have been served efficiently. The view is pleasant, there are better in London. If you want to see the view from a table outside you will need to request the high bar tables. There were five of us so we had a larger table outside but you couldn't see a view from it. I wouldn't go again. \",\n"," 'This has to be visited if only for drinks.

On Saturday 1st August we were joined by some clients from overseas whom we were entertaining.  On this occasion, we were staying at the Savoy, but given it was a nice evening we were told by our concierge that we would be looked after at Radio Rooftop Bar. We went to the lifts which we had previously used when stayed at Melia to enter Radio. Our guests entered the lift a few paces ahead of us with some other guests. As the doors were about to close, the security personnel at the desk made my husband and I leave the lift with our guests and started to interrogate us. Our guests went on ahead as the lift doors had closed. As you can imagine, being separated in this way was highly embarrassing to us. The young lady at the desk with a clipboard was demanding our room number which we gave to her, she spoke to a colleague over the radio who said that we were not staying at that particular room number. We told her that we were staying at the Savoy, and that they had advised us to visit with our clients and that she had already sent them up in the lift, however we were then rudely ushered out of the lift lobby and told to queue up outside. We were totally unaware there was another entrance and feel that we were totally disrespected by the staff on the ground floor entrance to Radio. Our client then spoke to a member of management in Radio, who then said we could enter. Our client even came down to the street entrance of Radio to see what was happening. He spoke to Francesca who was very dismissive toward our client and us. She then spoke to the internal lift entrance who had told her there hand been an altercation and we were refused entry altogether with our clients still inside.  As far as we were concerned, there was no altercation, not even a raised voice! Just a simple misunderstanding which left my husband and I totally humiliated in front of our clients.  We were expecting to spend in the region of at least £1000 in the bar on celebratory drinks and food which Radio Rooftop Bar has sadly missed out on due to the staff being incredibly rude, disrespectful and not managing the situation very well at all. We have emailed Radio Rooftop Bar twice to inform them of what happened on our evening, and they haven't even bothered to respond. Really poor show on their part.\",\n"," 'This is my favourite rooftop bar in London because there is a number of cocktails on the menu and they are always extremely delicious. There are also wonderful views of London!',\n"," \"Really funky location and great views across London. Prices can be expensive but you are paying for the views.

A tip however is to go to the bar, they tried to charge us a 15% service charge for bringing us drinks!!! My sister refused to pay it. We wanted to sit outside but we could have only have done that if we wanted to eat off of our laps which is ridiculous, we ended up indoors with a table that was just about fit to eat at. We ordered our food after asking if we could, we were only approached by the waiter for drinks orders. The food for how much it costs was worse than average, there wasn't much of it and even though we continually asked for condiments we never received them and one of our party got the wrong food and waited around an hour for the correct order. The wine was also warm. After complaining they gave us a free round of drinks and didn't charge us for the wrong food order, they were meant to take the service charge off of the bill but didn't and my husband paid it because he felt sorry for the waiter.

Service appalling, it took half an hour for them to acknowledge our presence, then nearly an hour to get our order correct. They still felt it was appropriate to apply the service charge.

Fair enough but it was a weekday and they had only just opened and it was empty - no need for it to have been said unless there was going to be an issue. Secondly the drinks are overpriced, which you would expect at a venue like this as, essentially you are paying for the view, however £7.00 for a Corona which was served semi cold without bottle or lime in a half pint glass - bit of a joke. The same applied for Rekorderlig cider - served without it's bottle in a half pint glass. Pretty sure you get more in an actual bottle and we couldn't help feeling ripped off. It was nice up there in the sun, but if you want a rooftop bar experience try Madison's overlooking St. Paul's. Cheaper drinks, better service and overall a better experience. \",\n"," 'Great venue but decor very dark....trendy black, shiny even in the toilets.

I am not sure why they service is so slow as there appears to be dedicated staff to serve afternoon tea and another bunch to serve lunch. The staff appear nice but you can tell some are biting their tongue! The china was broken or dirty and when you ask for a new cup because your one is cracked and has tea stains or left over scone crumbs stuck to the side from a previous sitting... you get questioned by the waiter as to why you need a new cup?!  The food was nice but not amazing! The views aren't that great especially if you are sitting in the middle! You are sitting so close to other tables that you can hear everyone complaining!

Decor is young and funky, DJ spinning some cool tracks and lots of beautiful people, including the staff. The drinks and tapas were very good. The staff generally aren't bad but there is a servive drop a little when it gets busier.  A couple of points: - minimum spend seems variable from the reviews, from £50 to £100 per head. Which is it? Does it vary by table? Its confusing. Ours was £75 but that was a total easily reached over 3 hours of eating and drinking. I wouldn't sweat it unless you are thinking of popping in for one drink - in which case, don't! - you need to make a reservation, especially on lovely evenings and weekends. Otherwise, its bery likely the lovely young lady downstairs will be politely turning you away.  - the entrance is not the main hotel entrance.

We didn't believe a word of it, so went in through STK instead. Once up in the lift we were shown to an outside table on the nearly empty terrace. Service was good actually. I invited my husband to join us but was told that because I hadn't made a reservation no extra guests could be accommodated - even though we were sitting at a table for 4. I explained that he had just taken a long flight and could they make an exception. They said they might so we ordered another bottle of wine and waited for him to arrive. They took absolute delight in turning him away about half an hour later saying that he was unsuitably dressed.......he was wearing Alexander MaQueen. The management are rude, vile and utterly obnoxious. They kept telling us the bar was full, it clearly wasn't but they just didn't like the fact that we had managed to go up there in the first place and wanted to teach us some sort of 'lesson'. Sometimes the only way to deal with people like this is to refuse to pay and I did. Please don't drink here, it makes them feel they're doing something right. There are better bars on rooftops all across London. This is run by arrogant, repugnant and downright offensive management who couldn't care less about their customers. Just avoid it.\",\n"," 'I have been Radio Rooftop a few times before when it first opened and loved it but over the years, as demand has grown, it has developed an attitude problem.

We never got served at the table so had to keep getting up to go to the bar and order ourselves but still you get charged 12.5%! There was no alcohol in the cocktails...we drank heaps and left stone cold sober. 13 quid for a cocktail with no alcohol is a rip off. A couple of friends wanted to join us later and despite having lots of space at our table they would not let them.

We were really unimpressed with the menu which was brunch until 3pm and very limited choices. The Mon - Fri lunch menu was shown to us because the drinks list was part of it and that looked much nicer but we were told we couldn't order from it at weekends. Ordered 2 steak, egg & chips and it was poor. Cold, undercooked chips, cheap cut of steak with a fried egg on top. Mine wasn't cooked as I had asked so got sent back and replaced but by the time it came out again my friend had finished. No apology was offered even though it was obvious that my friend had pretty much finished her meal. We ordered champagne and one of the glasses it came in was chipped so this had to be replaced.  The view of London from the bar is stunning and if this is your priority then go for it but maybe just drinks! If you want a lovely lunch then there are so many better choices in London. In my opinion it was overpriced and poor quality. 15% service was automatically added to the bill which considering we had to send a drink and a main course back seemed very presumptuous. I paid & left but will not return and feel like it was a poor choice for what should have been a lovely lunch. \",\n"," 'I took my father here on Saturday for a belated fathers day present. The views were nice and to top it off the weather was lovely so it was ideal for al-fresco dining. The staff were accommodating with my cocktail orders - as i asked for ones which werent on the menu. Food was delicious although the online menus are not clear as to what is served when. I originally thought we would have tapas food, but then discovered it is only served in the evenings, however, the brunch and lunch menus were still nice. Staff seemed rushed trying to cater for several tables, however we had a lovely time and would definitely go back again. I expect the views in the evening would be fantastic when London is lit up. Be aware there is a 15% service charge, which definitely adds extra to the bill - even 5* hotels such as The Ritz and Savoy do not charge that much!',\n"," 'Nice venue.

However, the experience has left me with a sour taste in my mouth.  Firstly, we were shown to our seats which had the worst views. I'm guessing you have to either have reserved a table to secure a view of the fantastic vista, or be dressed head to toe in Chanel!  Secondly, the table service was non existent. Fellow guests that came in after us were getting served whilst we were blatantly ignored. It was almost as if we were completely invisible. Needless to say, after 15 minutes, we walked out. We were going to book into the hotel for the evening with friends, however, after this negative experience, we will be abstaining! On the plus side, the Duty Manager was top drawer. He clearly observed us on the way in and commented to us regarding how quick we were leaving. We mentioned the reason for our speedy exit and he generously offered to give us a drink on the house. Unfortunately, we declined as I was so angry at this stage. However, it was greatly appreciated - thank you!

And so every round of drinks. But when we ordered some almonds and had to remind them of the order twice, I went to the (who appeared to be) a manager and said that the service is terrible. He didn't even apologise, just said he'd check on our snacks. There are some pointless suited personnel and enough waiters, they don't exactly break into sweat, but what they are therefore, I could not tell. There is actually someone who goes in the elevator with you to press the button! For crying out loud! Their service must be the reason for the £100 minimum spent rule. Otherwise customers would just leave. Also, the staff are not motivated to make any effort if everyone spends a minimum of £100 even before receiving any service.

When the sun is out - it's buzzing so be sure to book in advance (minimum spend applies but it isn't extortionate). There is table service and the views are great. If you haven't booked a table you can still walk in but if it is busy and later in the afternoon you will need to queue and the seats are mainly inside so a bit pointless! Drinks are at a premium and food is nice enough but expensive for what it is (meat platter was rationed!).

So, yes, it seemed expensive from street level, but once we were on the roof with drink in hand, food on the table and a lovely sunset unfolding before us, we did not mind the price so much.  The signature cocktails were tasty, albeit a little limited in range, but it was the tapas that impressed us most; it really was delicious. The waiting staff were also very attentive, so we were happy ordering bit by bit, rather than feeling obliged to order in bulk when we had their attention.  The terrace has a retractable roof and heat lamps to make it an all-weather venue, but it's nevertheless worth checking a weather forecast before making a booking. A drawback of being outside is that smokers from the bar will inevitably congregate near your table (I didn't spot a specific smoking zone), but I guess the same can be said for most outdoor eating/drinking venues. A tip: see if you can get a table on the south side overlooking the river. The view from the northwest side is an enjoyable mash up of rooftops and cranes, which look great silhouetted against the setting sun, but I'd have loved to have watched the river traffic while sipping my Thames River Iced Me.\",\n"," \"Took my friend here for a few birthday drinks after lunch on a lovely warm day.

I'll start with the planning, I was in talks with the events organiser Miriam, who was superb, so friendly and very helpful. Once I had decided what I wanted to do and where, I emailed Miriam and started the conversation, this was a good 6 weeks or so before the proposal. Miriam was quick to reply and usually with good ideas and helpful tips, we eventually managed to book me a cabana on the balcony for an hour or so. We set it up so that my fiancée was meeting a client and she was ushered up to the rooftop bar where I had laid out rose petals leading her to me. The bar also played isn't she lovely as she walked in, which was another request they were happy to go along with. They also helped out with hiding the parents, we had a few chats about this and in the end they were hidden at the other side of the on the balcony. Honestly, the staff in the bar were so helpful and even excited for me, the atmosphere was great and we had our own waitress. The proposal went perfectly, she said 'yes' which was lucky since our parents were present and hiding round the corner. Immediately after the proposal (as requested) the parents were ushered out to our cabana accompanied by a large bottle of champagne to share. We then enjoyed the moment and the cabana for the next hour before heading downstairs to STK for dinner. Overall, the staff and Miriam were helpful and very friendly which helped everything run as smooth as it could. The manager even came out to greet me and wish me luck at one point which was a nice touch. The bar itself is stunning, very well laid out and the balcony has a very cool vibe along with amazing views. Highly recommended.\",\n"," \"great ambience, great drinks, love the sliders.

It was £150 minimum spend to secure the table which I thought was ok for this type of bar/restaurant in Central London.

Positives are that the management took the complaint very well with regards to service and offered some free drinks. The views are amazing of the South Bank, you can see for miles. They also closed off our part of the restaurant / bar at about 9pm and didn't give us alternative seating around the section that was remaining open. Security were quite pushy and abrupt.

We had a fabulous couple of days and will definitely go again. - only slight niggle was that you look on the menu and the cost of the drink/cocktail/food isn't actually what you pay as there is service automatically added and I think VAT extra - for instance the cocktails were say £13.00 each but the bill was £29.00 maybe the price you pay should be advertised.

We were told we should of requested outside on the booking. I would have thought the 'rooftop' terrace was a given when booking and guaranteeing to spend a lot of money, I actually laughed when he showed us the table because I thought he was joking. We managed to find a table by ourselves outside after some people left but were told to move half an hour later as they close all but a small section of the terrace after 11. I don't think I've ever been more dissappionted in a venue. We did complain and in the end didn't have to meet our minimum spend which was something but still, was shocked how bad it was. The Boundary is a million times better, or shoreditch house, sushi samba, Pagoda looks better but I haven't been.

Booked a table for 3 for drinks late afternoon. Requested an outside table and told it couldn't be guaranteed. After a very nice greeting by the Maitre D' and a promise that we'd have an outside table once one became available, the table service after that was sporadic. Good at times, slow at others, so slow On occasions that we chose to queue up at the bar instead of waiting. No follow up on the table becoming available outside so we asked and just received a blank looking saying 'sorry it's too busy outside, it's not going to be possible today'. I wish we'd just received a bit of honesty when we got there and been told that it was going to be very unlikely that we'd receive the requested table. We would have been fine then. We would have kicked back and settled at the table we had. Instead, I had a situation where my clients were eager to get outside enjoy the sunshine. Everything else was fine.

We were met with a frosty reception when we arrived to take the table that we had booked 6 weeks in advance. As if was a nice sunny day, we hoped that we could sit outside given the advance notice of the booking. The staff treated us as if we were asking for the moon and were very dismissive. Once seated we were not given any menus, whilst no one came to take our drinks orders. After close to 30 minutes we got up to order from the bar instead and we told very frostily to return to our tables. Once a member of the serving shaft arrived be practically threw menus at us in a very surly manner.  After our somewhat mediocre brunch, the waitress arrived at our table and started clearing plates before all of our party had finished eating - surely breaking the first rule of good service? Then add on the 45 minute wait for our bill and to pay.  All in all a very poor and disappointing experience. The views are spectacular and on a sunny day it is undoubtably a lovely place to wile away the hours, but don't expect anyone to be nice to you.\",\n"," \"Not a push place to spend time, Very busy and not class.

The bar itself is beautiful and the views are fantastic, on a sunny day it could be one of those places where you are so happy to be there however the staff that work there totally ruin this. From the front of house that stands in a darkened corridor by the lift, giving you the third degree on whether you have a booking, to the lack of attention or care when you order your drinks. I'm surprised that I've been there twice (about 6 months apart - one with friends and one for business) and the experience of the staff is exactly the same. Drinks took on average 20mins to arrive, it doesn't feel like there is enough staff working. During a 3hr visit, we received two drinks with the first order being wrong!! They also do a brunch menu but their tapas menu, which is delicious doesn't start till 3pm so if you want something other than eggs around 1pm, you have a little while to wait....along with your drinks that you've most probably ordered twice already.  Such a shame as radio bar would be a really special London hotspot and would love to have my mind changed but sadly both experiences were too similar for me to return.\",\n"," 'We were there at 7pm on a Saturday evening - crazy prices for drinks, excessively noisy music/DJ, felt very much like a \"meat market\".

The crowd in there was not great and one bearded waiter was quite rude to a few people the girls who looked after us were lovely though!

They had always smiling, friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. They make you feel special!... Not like on Ritz where we almost felt that looking after us was an obligation. Throughout the tea we had several treats! All the food was a exquisite! It\\'s an afternoon tea with a twist. My greatest compliments to the Chef and the team in the kitchen. It\\'s just not the usual finger sandwiches... They have a twist!... And the petitfours were delicate, light and delicious! Finally the environment... It\\'s informal, but not casual.

The design would have been very suited to 15 years ago. However nothing has changed. I don’t think that people want to eat from a very limited (they only offer a choice of three puddings) menu in a drafty restaurant that’s filled with loud, electronic, music. The meal itself whilst it would have been acceptable was vastly overpriced. All the sauces were gelatinous and very heavily seasoned. The red wine sauce my husband had with his steak had an “almost burnt” flavour. Not enough to complain about but not good. The charge for the steak was #29. For this you got a steak, some rather gelatinous sauce and six (6!) chips.  As I’ve said we’re staying here and haven’t experienced the same problems with breakfast so I suspect that it’s a problem with dinner rather than the actual restaurant. I don’t have a problem taking breakfast here again as the main restaurant’s not open but we won’t be eating an evening meal here nor will we be recommending it.\n","4, 0.43469983173741233, On my second visit I was greeted by Salah ( not sure on the spelling) and she was extremely rude and impatient.

Tables are spaced well apart and there is a one way system through the restaurant.\n","6, 0.8469231232352878, What a place michael and salla on front desk were amazing drinks were brilliant best place in London for views and people watching \n","7, 0.840305442159826, Great costumer service, Jessy took care of us and made it a holiday to remember, would definitely come back!\n","8, 0.5614308935430081, Don’t even know from where to start because everything was just a big misunderstanding. So we call before booking on the day to see if it’s worth to even try to book. I call the hostess and she is in a place where the music is so loud I can’t even hear her. She said yes they have tables. I come in, I’m fine with the table inside since they said there’s no available tables outside. They sat us right next to the door that everyone kept forgetting to close even after asked several times to either transfer us or jus CLOSE THE DOOR. The hostess is rude, waiters are rude. We are customers and you have to respect us, not have attitude. Simple questions piss them off. I’ve been here once before and the waiter was so rude we had to ask him to ask someone else to serve us. We thought we’ll give them another chance. But What is wrong with all the staff? Even bar staff just looks at everyone as if they don’t want people to be there. There’s so many beautiful rooftops in London and this is definitely not the one to go to have fun. \n","9, 0.6443294395549664, Places like this, with no respect for Covid guidelines, are the reason restaurants are all being forced to close once again. They made a big show of asking us questions & taking our temperatures before we went inside, but once you're in there it's a complete free for all.  There was a table of 6 men next to us (who blatantly did not live together, because we heard them talking about it, very loudly) and a table of 2 women next to them. They joined their tables together, and staff were quite content to let them so long as they kept buying drinks - and not even a lot of drinks, the women have 4 cocktails between them, and the 6 men only ordered 2 bottles of champagne over the two hours we were there.  All 8 of them kept shouting and yelling all evening, spitting their germs across the place, getting up from their tables, moving chairs around, and behaving like unruly children at a 5-year-olds birthday party.  Completely ruined our evening, and to be honest, wouldn't be surprised if we end up with covid after being stuck sat next to them. Told the front of house about it and all they could do was say sorry, but didn't really seem bothered.\n","10, 0.7422763147661763, Great service and lovely drinks. Thank you so much Otto, you are the best barman, so helpful and friendly - he deserves a pay rise! Thank you \n","11, 0.7569519073244125, The perfect setting for this special meal.  All I can say is that the staff , the food, the service, the atmosphere was 100%. we could not find fault or criticise in any way, just a totally enjoyable evening,  Would highly recommend to anyone thinking of going  But very good idea to book in advance.\n","12, 0.6976399795953617, This is the usual for such a bar/restaurant unfortunately. Pumped up prices for the view. £7 for a bottle of beer, £17 for a cocktail. Surly waitress made no effort to accommodate our requests.\n","13, 0.7358239080224719, A friend of mine recommended it.  It’s lovely. Nice waitresses and waiters are very friendly and making you to feel great!  Prices are normal. What do you expect? A McDonald’s as a roof top bar? Drinks were fine and the food as well!  Definitely recommend it!\n","14, 0.7732774595637898, My friend and I went for breakfast, we wanted seating with a view and they gave us an option to sit outside or inside. We sat outside, it’s stunning. Service was v attentive by all staff. Mercedes was v friendly and looked after us very well, she made the experience even better. The views are incredible, you can see all the main London sites here. We had a fabulous time, would love to come back again in the evening. \n","15, 0.5903003991466679, We only stopped in for a few sundowners so can’t comment on the food. Gorgeous bar with great views, delicious signature cocktails and great service. Good social distancing plan, however the man that greats you at the lift maybe takes it a step too far. Made us scan in four times which made no sense. Maybe a lack of understanding how the scanning app works.\n","16, 0.6672934875430832, Views may be good in the right seat but most seats are inside, when you’re sat at your table not allowed to move to an outdoor table for the views even if one come available. Although several other people did move to join other tables and this was just overlooked by staff even with covid restrictions in place. Cocktails were good but very overpriced especially when you don’t get the view that the overpriced cocktail pays for.\n","17, 0.5841508100304422, Was sat inside despite booking a month in advance. Asked 3 different members of staff if we could move outside as there was empty tables. This was denied by staff as government guidelines don’t allow table moving (news to me?!) and also watched them let two different tables who were talking across the room join in to one. Will never be back. One rule for one and one rule for another.\n","18, 0.5224744601357252, Came to this restaurant with a few of my friends during the Eat out to help out scheme. We did not get 50% off even though they advertised it and informed us that they offer it as we walked in, but our bill was full price. We were treated disrespectfully and the waiter was rude, food was cold and the view from our seats was terrible. We were sat on a sofa with a table as low as our knees so had to pickup our plates and eat off our knees. The food was cold and extremely overpriced. We asked for one selection of toast and got served and charged for two which is not what we asked for. Terrible, terrible place.\n","19, 0.5859909263940958, Staff where welcoming and, we had an outside table, which was still nice and warm as the covers where over and the heating on, on a good day the view will be amazing, sadly weather was awful today, but this didn’t spoil anything. Service was excellent and staff where attentive, you can scan a QR code with the menu on, it only shows their signature cocktails but they will make whatever you like. We had a couple of snacks and starters which where lovely, couldn’t fault. Yes it’s expensive, but it’s a rooftop bar in the middle of London!! Would definitely return, perhaps we will have a better view!! \n","20, 0.6344955151731317, Absolutely shocking! A friend of ours, staying at the hotel, booked a table for ten of us When we got there (not at any point before) we were told that: _ because of COVID, they had a 6 people max policy per table _ they didn’t have any table outdoors with heaters or blankets If you know anybody that ever came here to sit indoors and have his group split on two tables... then I am really sirrry for you!! Avoid! The picture was taken during our stay, “no tables available outside, sorry!”\n","21, 0.6841244421035145, Why would you own a great venue like this only to employ staff that are so bloody rude and stuck up! Even if they owned it you would/should have more respect for your customers, we were staying at the hotel it was a Saturday afternoon we decided to go for a quick cocktail on the roof before we got ready for the evening, we were wearing jeans and trainers, very clean white trainers I might add, we asked for a table for 3 the two girls on the reception literally looked at us like we were trash, then told us no they had no tables, sorry, I said I can see loads of empty tables she said yes but they are reserved for hotel guest, I said great we are guests after taking our room number she gave us a table in the corner, I politely asked if we could have a table outside she said no as there were no tables for 3 outside!! She was completely now above her station at this point and then three over the top dressed women got taken to a table outside I then just insisted that I was going to sit outside, how dare anyone treat a customer like that I wasn’t going to get my drinks any cheaper, I believe my bill for 2 cocktails and a glass of prosecco was just over £60, overpriced yes but I knew that it would be but don’t treat me or any customer like crap because you don’t like how they are dressed on a Saturday afternoon, not that it matters but I am a director of my own company and I treat all of my staff how I wish to be treated! Change your staff or change their training\n","22, 0.6530917721225861, Absolutely awful, we booked a table online for 9:45. This would have been fine, however we were not informed the bar shut in a hour, this meant we had 30 minutes before the bar shut! We had a £100 voucher we were gifted for our friends birthday, and had to spend this in 30 minutes. The staff were so rude, and sat us inside, even though we wanted to sit outside on the FREE tables. We had to beg to move, and by that time we had 20 minutes to try and spend £100. The staff came around and said last orders were ready to be made, and that the kitchen had shut, which we were not informed of. To make matters worse, the staff allowed a different table to order and bought them out some fresh desert. This made us feel inferior.  Ruined my friends birthday night, would not recommend and wish we had been treated better. The only good thing was the view.\n","23, 0.8163199977441268, This is one of our favourite spots to have a few cocktails in London. The drinks are quirky and taste great! Y. Terrel made sure our visit was extra special as it was my birthday. She was really friendly and her service was impeccable. Would 100% recommend this bar.\n","24, 0.591722807409812, My friend and I went to Radio Rooftop for the first time last night and had the most fantastic time, I am baffled by all these moany negative reviews!  The doormen, front of house and waiters couldn’t be friendlier. We were lucky to have great weather and an outside table with fantastic views. The food was delicious - we had chicken satay, patatas bravas, cheese ravioli and churros all of which we’d recommend. The cocktails were lovely. There was a minimum spend of £50 each as it was a Saturday. It’s pricey but it’s a fancy bar in London, if you don’t want to pay don’t go!  My only negative would be the womens toilets were an absolute state, felt like I was in a club at the end of the night! None of the locks worked, smelt bad, messy cubicles, glasses on the sink. This was disappointing as it didn’t fit the place plus was a shock when cleanliness is such a big thing in the current climate! \n","25, 0.6962339022220709, I came here on Saturday (5th) and it was lovely! The staff were really friendly and the drinks were really good. I was a bit unsure when I came after some of the reviews but can honestly say I really enjoyed it. The only bad thing is not being able to see the views due to the weather but other than that was a really nice visit and excited to visit again. \n","26, 0.6186700207846505, Cannot fault Radio Rooftop.  Allowed me to use a gift voucher which had recently expired and I was unable to use during lockdown. Fantastic staff, attentive and polite. The food was excellent. Would definitely go again.\n","27, 0.7979590992132822, Absolute quality breakfast in an amazing setting! Great food, great setting and great service! Great vegan choice. Breakfast tea was a bit slow to start but made up by the aforementioned.\n","28, 0.5496314576502597, Talk about over priced and very pretencious! Staff very friendly and tables were clean but I could not believe the prices.  £13 for a very small and average rose wine Lager was bottled which was then poured into a crystal glass, maybe that's why they charged so much. View lovely especially as the sun came down and south bank lit up. But the end bill that arrived put a downer on the evening really..... Very much a special occaision venue\n","29, 0.5885394074454415, Never have I been to a place with such rude, obnoxious and care free staff. Such a massive shame as the bar is in a lovely setting with an amazing view, however the cocktails are overpriced and taste of either pure alcohol (not drinkable at all) or weak squash and the staff simply do not care about your service.  Had a voucher to use for my 21st birthday celebrations to which they were extremely reluctant to take and we received a blunt “my manager will accept your voucher” when there was nothing wrong with it... however this wasted 20 minutes of our expected 1 hr 45 at the bar. We eventually received our drinks 30 mins into our stay, revolting cocktails, definitely not worth the £18 per one. 5 mins later we got asked for last orders (waitress was so rude and just shrugged her shoulders not giving the slightest care), however we were not told this upon arrival so we were not impressed to have 30 mins to use the full voucher value when you could book a table up to 1.5hrs later than our arrival time. We then thought to use the voucher for some food instead of overpriced drinks, but her Care free response Again was “kitchen closed an hour ago” which again we were not told. I then stood up to take a photo and got shouted at by the rude waitress again.  10 minutes before close we were finally brought our drinks that were just shoved on our table without letting us know what was what and then the manager and 2 waitresses proceeded to present a plate of fresh desserts and cake to a table nearby giggling, yet we were told the kitchen had closed an hour ago but it was obviously open for staff to feed their friends.... Absolutely appalling customer service and quite frankly embarrassing on their behalf. Expected to have a 1hr 45 time slot as advertised when booking, however the bar closed within 40 minutes of arrival. Certainly will not be returning and would only recommend this bar for the view and if one wishes to pay £18 for a dribble of squash in a mug !\n","30, 0.5639361317645121, What a waste of money! I’m making the booking I explained that I suffered from a disability and that I would like sitting outside if the weather was fine if not could I be seated in doors. I found the hostesses to be nonchalant and not very welcoming. We were seated outside it was extremely windy and cold. We asked to be re-seated in doors as the cold was beginning to cause me extreme pain. It took over 20 minutes before we were offered sitting indoors at which point we were leaving. On the positive the cocktails whilst pricey were very good, Our server was very professional and approachable however too busy to be able to give the level of service we had expected. Not my first visit there but probably my last whilst it has impressive views for me that’s all it had going for it last night. There are several of the better venues in London where you can get just as good view with better service.\n","31, 0.49306065309792757, Painfully slow service (I think we waited 30 minutes for our second drink order) and had to asked to move seats after being stuck out in the cold! The hostess told us we couldn’t move once seated but the waiter kindly moved us. Over priced for what it is - won’t be in a hurry to return. \n","32, 0.7673472080911908, Wow blown away by this place. delicious food, amazing cocktails and fabulous service. Very impressed that our waitress picked up on the fact it was my birthday and brought out a delicious desert with a candle. Great atmosphere, spectacular views, thoroughly recommended! \n","33, 0.8038483237226804, Had a really lovely lunch here with my friend. The views are fantastic. The food was really lovely and drinks delicious.\n","34, 0.6038402644882488, Me and my boyfriend booked a table for a dinner, special occasion was my birthday.  Have to admit- whoever there a reception manager have to train they staff how to treat guests and make they evening special. Rude,unpolite and so cold . I am a reception manager in one of fine dinning restaurant in Mayfair. If my staff would treat this way guests- fired same minute. Upon arrival straight away no at least hello- you got table for 1.5 hours. OK...then hostess took us right in the middle of the restaurant where all people passing by. I saw many empty tables- I did ask if we can be moved,she answered no this tables all for bigger groups despite that there where 3 empty tables for 2. Ok... after 20 min someone came to take an order... while we were waiting for a drinks (£18 for a double gin and lemonade) she filled all tables even this table as she claimed for bigger group with 2 people. Ok... finally our starters arrived,in the middle of having snacks, we decide to order 1 more drink and left both plates with half of food, lady approached our table and collected both plates with food in there. We were shocked.. anyways we left after 1 hour being there with no good bye and without Birthday wishes as we do. I am so disappointed, Birthday happens ones a year. Will never go back !!! \n","35, 0.6798883490264416, We came all the way from Leeds after seeing this place on social media and it did not disappoint. We came for breakfast and ordered a selection of things. Avocado on toast, Omelettes and Pancakes. The food was amazing and did not take long to arrive. To top it off the views from this place are insane and the atmosphere is excellent. The staff were very accommodating and the women at the reception area were lovely and made us feel very comfortable and were very welcoming. I will defo be coming next time I am in London. Great place for a special occasion.\n","36, 0.7287318900227546, We have just returned from a fabulous weekend stay at ME London and one of the main reasons we chose this hotel was because of the wonderful Radio Rooftop Bar. We are frequent visitors to the bar and have always found the staff to be extremely courteous and friendly. This weekend was no exception, the service was great. The manager, Emmeric, is always a welcoming face and he goes the extra mile to make the experience a memorable one. We have always been given the choice on whether we would like to be seated inside or out and the staff have never grumbled when we change our minds with the weather conditions! The views are truly spectacular and when we are meeting up with friends from overseas we always take them to Radio as there is no better way of seeing the iconic sights of London (whilst sipping on a cocktail and eating the awesome triple cooked Parmesan chips!) It has got a really cool vibe and at night the atmosphere is buzzing. Winter and summer this continues to be one of our favourite places in London. \n","37, 0.5868183351480044, It’s a shame as despite of the great cocktails with one of the best views bar In London has disappointed us on our date with a very unfriendly service. The lady who served us outside gave us the “look” everytime we asked for a new order and ended our night snapping to us to pay the bill and leave. Not recommending to return if you won’t want to ruin your date!\n","38, 0.624012868319239, Very rude staff and makes you question what the £20 service charge was actually for and what you pay a premium.  Would not go back.\n","39, 0.35577413865498136, Won’t not come back here at all. Really rude staff spoils the whole experience also ridiculously overpriced!  Nice views but honestly not worth it.\n","40, 0.5649462867350805, Stunning views but the cocktails are a bit hit and miss and somewhat overpriced, the food is fine. It is worth a visit for the view but don’t expect to be too impressed by the food or cocktails. \n","41, 0.46291927280633344, Very slow service today, we booked 2 tables of six. Our final round took so long to come that the bar staff cancelled it and told us they didn’t have enough time to serve. Needless to say we weren’t spending light\n","42, 0.5839736210105846, Decided to take my boyfriend here last weekend for a special occasion date night because it seemed to be one of London’s seriously hyped cocktail bars and we wanted a ‘rooftop’ experience. I was mainly interested in coming for cocktails but since they do food I thought I’d book a table for 7:30pm so that we could eat first and then stay on for some drinks after. I did not read the small print in my booking confirmation that tables are only reserved for one and a half hours. I do accept my fault in overlooking this. However I have never experienced a restaurant/bar venue that does not allow customers to stay on for drinks after dining there. It did not occur to me that I’d need to make two separate reservations in order to prevent being kicked out so I didn’t think to do this. So we turned up at 7:30 with just the one reservation. When they reminded us on our arrival that we only had the table for 90 mins I started to worry that we would indeed be kicked out after the meal and not able to stay on for drinks. So once we were seated I went back to the hostess’ desk and asked her if we could stay for drinks since we were already dining. She rudely and brusquely responded ‘We are fully booked’. No apology, no nothing. Now, I’m not expecting them to conjure a table for us out of thin air if they really are fully booked BUT I was shocked at her rudeness and she could have been a great deal more sympathetic and hospitable about it. Also, since we noticed tables were often empty for periods of time between bookings, I really think she could have tried to have been more accommodating if she wanted to, eg. seeing if there was a table we could have for just 45 mins. This is the sort of hospitality that I always would expect to experience at any ‘high end’ establishments like this. The hostess’ rudeness shocked me so much that I returned to my table in tears and proceeded to cry silently for the next few minutes. Our food was really bad. The calamari appetiser was very good but the steak which I ordered was one of the worst I’ve ever eaten: chewy with revolting chips. And very expensive too. When the waiter asked why I hadn’t really eaten it and I told him I found it too chewy he didn’t apologise. Once we finished dinner we were then asked to leave before the next booking arrived. All in all this place is overhyped, overpriced and rude, completely capitalising on their rooftop view (which by the way, wasn’t even as advertised. They covered our section of the restaurant with a dingy grey roof cover, with just a small window left to even see the view. Not at all like the ‘open air’ PR photos). I wish that all the bad reviews on sites like Tripadvisor would actually have some effect and force this place to improve on how they run things. But sadly there will always be a steady stream of tourists and influencers queuing up to get their Instagram photos there, and so Radio Rooftop has little incentive to even care about their miserable ripped off customers. \n","43, 0.6328169328650248, Before you decide not to go ask yourself what you are going for. We went for a couples meal. Wrong. The rooftop terrace is stunning and the clientele was decidedly younger. The first thing you meet on arrival (its a hotel) is a bouncer - not a good start. The music is loud so be warned. The menu is limited - sea bass, steak, macaroni cheese and a salad - 4 items. That’s it!  And the food is overcooked. Rubber calamari. The sea bass actually burnt my mouth! I think it’s 3 minutes skin side down and 1 minute flipped over. How do you get it that hot? Finally, the wine is exorbitant. Pinot, Sauvignon and Albariño £56/bottle for tame wine. Certainly not the finest. And finally, finally (honest) they “forgot” to take off the Government discount. Not going back.  But, if you are a young gun who wants expensive cocktails and music maybe it’s for you. \n","44, 0.5835893511772156, Group of 12 for celebrations, due to COVID we required 2 tables of 6 to abide by social distancing guidelines but when we booked we asked for them to be close by, that was completely ignored and they placed us two different ends of the roof. On arrival we asked if we could be moved nearer as we couldn’t even see the others and this was completely ignored. The service was awful, at one point it took 45 minutes for the drinks to come and on another occasion we had to go and track our waiter down as we were sitting there with no drinks. We were told no shorts earlier in the week when we enquired about dress code via email, the email response we received was rude and snobbish reminding us it’s a 5 star luxury hotel. We got there in the 34 degree heat in jeans only to find 70% of male guests had shorts on. I have been to much better venues and roof gardens, great views. Terrible service, and poor attitudes!  Not a 5 star experience at all!\n","45, 0.5911981516650745, Worst food and service I have ever experienced! cocktails were hit and miss and over priced. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. There are plenty of good cocktails bars in London with a good view, good food and friendly staff. This is NOT one of them. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.\n","46, 0.6344486075368795, Hotel is lovely, staff were very friendly, the view is nice but you can get a better view elsewhere. Although I know its an expensive area and the view is lovely, the cost of the drinks simply isnt worth it for what you get. £20 gets you a small cocktail, whilst it was presented very nicely and tasted great, for £20 I would want it to be a little bit bigger.  We had the calamari and chicken satay just as a little snack, again expensive but tasted nice. Would I come back here? No, Ive seen it and done it now and believe there are better places to go. Would I recommend this place? No, again I think there are better places to go in London.  Social Distancing measures were very good, all staff wore masks and it is expected that you wear a mask when walking through the hotel and lift up to the bar.\n","47, 0.6821228507834832, Choose the Radio Rooftop bar as part of our first day outing after 4 months of staying home due to London lockdown. We planned a day in London seeing some sights and was really looking forward to a lovely meal on the rooftop over looking London to finish our day before heading home. We had made telephone booking for 5 people at 4pm a few weeks back as I know this place is popular. We had our 15 and 18 year old sons with us. We arrived at 4pm only to be told they have a over 21 only policy after 5pm. We stayed for a drink and snack before heading back out to North London to support a local restaurant instead. Very disappointed this was not explained on the phone. I would assume if we make a booking for 4pm for dinner the person making the booking should check the age or explain their policy just incase. Even the person on entry to the venue was a bit rude and just said \"well thats our policy\" when I ask for an explanation. I have looked at their website and it is stated on the bottom of their home page in small print. But I never looked there so overall only a 3 and that's for the waiter and the view. Everything else was a litte over priced and average. Ended up we had a lovely meal for half the price in our local area.\n","48, 0.5534467005303928, Avoid, avoid, avoid. Made a booking online and when we arrived we were told that we had to sit inside. Who goes to a rooftop bar to sit inside? When asked if we could sit outside staff were rude and obnoxious even though there were free tables which they said were first come first serve. Also their website implies if you make a booking you’ll be seated outside, which is misleading and not the case if you’re a party of 4 or less. There’s so many great places to go in London, and this isn’t one of them. \n","49, 0.7964504361152649, Richard; my guy, best waiter about; anything you need, sorted. Top night. Great service. Great views\n","50, 0.5930217493255183, Booked a table three days in advance to sit outside. They made me and my husband sit inside with a lame excuse. We also payed 50 pounds for two watery cocktails, nuts and a bottle of water. I do not recommend this place. It ruined our night.\n","51, 0.6760160944678567, A nice place to have some drinks, great service and view. The drinks are amazing, the food? Have to say: it is nice, but if you very hungry it is not a place to go. But for chill out and have some drinks do not think twice. \n","52, 0.6458382308483124, Visited Radio on an evening during a city break and can honestly say one of the most expensive places I have ever visited (having travelled and lived in several countries). A simple basic cocktail is £18 (served in a teacup?), simply not worth it. A good view but not amazing and food was ok, 12.5% service charge added to the bill, would not return.\n","53, 0.5906315554272045, The views are gorgeous, definitely better to go on a dry day when the covers aren't up! The only criticism is as lovely as the cocktails were, they were extremely small portions, as were the chips - the chips were literally 9 large slices of chips stacked one on top of the other. Certainly not filling by any stretch! \n","54, 0.5894541606611136, My partner and I visited on 19/8/20 for a cocktail or 2 as we wanted a rooftop experience. We were shown to our table but then had to wait at least 25 mins to be served, we ordered a beer and 2 cocktails. The drinks are very expensive (£47 in total for 3 drinks) but I wouldn't have minded this if they were worth it and the service was just not good enough! My cocktail cost £18 and it was served in basically a mug and tasted like squash, we were then charged nearly £5 on top for poor service, the bar server was unfriendly. Will not be returning or recommending to anyone, there are plenty of classy, welcoming bars in London so I will stick to them!\n","55, 0.49971298043359846, Booked for party of 5 with minimum spend of £50 per head in 80 min slot. MAnaged to quaff down enough expensive, slow served drinks to make it to £298 and left to another bar Covent Garden (not fun and less snotty) 2 days later they charge me 5 x £50 cover charge although I had spent the required cash !!! Called and emailed twice have still to have a resolution or acknowledgement.. was promised callback after first call but alas nothing. Am reporting this as fraud to my credit card company as cannot get any joy whatsoever from the company. Don’t waste your time or money ... looks great on the outside but lacks soul and substance on the inside. It’s like an ATM machine that never gives you anything but debits your account\n","56, 0.5875518948761458, The view was absolutely amazing. When entering the venue we were asked to show our ID’s so we did upon a staff member making the remark of “show your boarding passes girls”. We were then seated away from the rest of our group, a couple asked if we wanted to swap so we did. We were then told we could not swap as the table had 15 minutes of their reservation passed. 35 minutes passed the table were still sat there.  We tried to order drinks and each time they took 30 minutes to arrive it was clear they wanted us to leave. We eventually asked for the bill and shock the bill arrived within a minute with a £40 service charge. With it being a special birthday for one of the group member’s we did not want to discuss at the venue our experience. I can say I will not be visiting again based on the staff at the venue.  Very disappointed for the amount of money spent and what was suppose to be a special day.\n","57, 0.5247518548778459, I came here 3 years ago to celebrate my sons 18th birthday and really enjoyed the experience. Unfortunately I cannot say the same when taking my other son for his 18th birthday. Poor service, over priced drinks and warm beer, I won’t be going back.\n","58, 0.8030664126078287, absolutely beautiful place with the most tastiest drinks .  Would love to book again.  But gets really hard to get the booking.\n","59, 0.6224453172018362, It's a bit overpriced for us but since we love the rooftop style so it's alright. The view over The Thames is spectacular, the food and cocktails were good as well. Tourists would love spending time here.\n","60, 0.7439450251645056, Very nice in the summer with the outside seating. A little expensive but good atmosphere with lots of interesting people. Had a great time with friends.\n","61, 0.6283048017458482, Where did it go wrong... It is clear that Radio has a Licensing issue. No standing at the bar for a drink, no dancing, no bottle service! This used to be the IN place to go, but not anymore it seems. The BUZZ has gone from the place sadly. The DJ booth is no more.  Good choice of cocktails and professionally made.  Stayed at the hotel and had breakfast in Radio. Very good choice of food and quality very good. Let’s hope that Westminster Council change their mind Re: License restrictions at the next Licensing session\n","62, 0.7788440243366661, I chose to purpose to my girlfriend at the radio rooftop and it was worth It 100% prior to arrangements I have to start by thanking The receptionist “Samantha” she honestly made this day more special and she took care of everything from the start to finish. So if your ever wanting to purpose at this venue Samantha is the right person you want to get in touch with, her kind personality but also her willingness to do all she can going above and beyond make your time enjoyable at Radio rooftop bar. We loved the relaxed feel of this place the atmosphere makes you feel very comfortable as well as the staff and it had an romantic touch to it, especially for the occasion. The views were emphatic and my fiancé enjoyed it a perfect setting for the perfect moment. I definitely would return to try more dishes as the food we had was refreshing and delicious. Our table was outside & Service was well-timed and friendly, everything was affordable and not so cosy effective Overall it was a great experience. 10/10  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Thanks For making this day special for the both of us.\n","63, 0.538913851365065, We booked a table for 8 pm and were running late, so we were trying to call the bar to advise of the delay, but the phone was not working. Upon arrival there was no security to let us in and luckily we came across some hotel staff who helped. The wait took us to 20 mins late and when we finally reached the rooftop we were told our table outside was gone and we were sat in the corner by the toilets. I asked to speak to manager but was told there was no manager, so we decided to leave. I thought the receptionists/hostesses were very rude and to be honest it's been a while that I have been treated the way I was treated today at Radio bar. It wasn't my 1st time at Radio but it might as well the last\n","64, 0.6303362904243099, My husband and I were staying at the ME hotel and decided to meet a friend for drinks at the Radio roof bar on Thursday night. From the minute we were greeted the staff were very off hand and unhelpful. We asked for a sofa on the terrace and despite there being 2 empty sofas we were told it was very busy and we could have a table in the restaurant. We only intended staying for drinks so it seemed a bit odd sitting in the restaurant area. The sofas remained empty so after asking a further 2 staff if we could have drinks on one of them they eventually said we could. No one came over to ask if we would like a drink and my husband had to go over to 2 staff members who were standing chatting and politely ask if we could get some drinks. This is the second time I have visited and my first visit was equally as unpleasant but because we were staying in the hotel I thought it would be good to give it another go. The views are absolutely outstanding - it is a shame the staff are not.\n","65, 0.6185129640601841, My husband and I received a giftcard for Champagne afternoon Tea at Me London for a wedding present. When we wanted to use it, we realized that it had expired 10 days before (6 months expiration). I wrote them immediately saying how sorry we were to see that the gift card had only lasted 6 months and not 12 or 24 months like our other gift certificates we received. When I wrote them if there was something they could do, they simply said that they didn't offer that service anymore, but we were welcome to book a table with them at spend at least 50 pounds per person on eating there. When I asked them if they really couldn't find it in their heart to give us something, be is just a cup of coffee and cake or something, I was sent on to another person who then again just said that our gift certificate expired. And then we were told that there was nothing they could do. I realize that the gift certificate was 10 days overdue, but that a place like that can't find it in their heart to offer newlyweds even just a cup of coffee so their friends present isn't a total waste... I find that pretentious and heartless. That's just the worst costumer service I ever had! Don't expect any kindness from this place.\n","66, 0.5881686155535594, 6 of us ladies -After eating at STK we asked the ME hostess if we could go upstairs for drinks, she said there was a 30 minute wait so we moved to the downstairs bar area. She came through after 10 minutes and said there had been a 'cancellation' so we went up in the lift and were shown to seating area. Because it was dark and windy we didn't get to see any of the views due to the plastic sheeting which was tied down. We paid £17 for a G&T :-( I will probably visit again in the summer just to get to experience the view\n","67, 0.6541464437720597, Unfortunately it was raining and windy so we couldn’t see the view. The drinks are very expensive but I guess it’s London prices and attached to a hotel. Walking through, there is a staff member who checks on an iPad for your booking then followed through to another staff member going into the lift with you to the rooftop bar. It’s romantic but we had to share a couch with another couple. It must be great in the summer when the roof is open. \n","68, 0.7197425039485097, Was there for a lunch recently and the whole experience was fantastic.  Biking online was easy and on arrival. Ten staff were super organised.  Good, although not big portion sizes, was very well cooked and presented.  Cocktails - they were as amazing as the view from the rooftop.  Staff were first class.  Will be back. \n","69, 0.6720077889530283, Lovely place with nice views over London. Went here for some mid day drinks with my family and were really excited since a friend of mine had told me good stuff about this place. Well... It turns out that the service were quite rude and not nice in any way. Also the drinks were quite over priced, but they had many options to choose from so that was atleast good.\n","70, 0.6114306148856578, Pleasantly suprised having read some quite negative reviews. Very warm welcome and super friendly waiter (from Budapest). Good menu choice and food arrived quickly but we were not rushed. We had starters and rib eye steak with parmesan chips (which are to die for!!) Of course this restaurant sells itself on the view - what can I say - it lived up to our expectations. I would recommend Radio - not the cheapest but not the most expensive and definitely an experience I will repeat. Made my birthday!\n","71, 0.7420635330371368, We go here frequently for breakfast before going to the museum or opera house in covent garden with my toddler. The food is delicious and the environment calm, and soothing. There are lovely views from the terrace and service is fantastic. Love the waffles and the full English. Jessie is always very friendly and makes the effort to talk and engage with my 2 year old. We will be back soon.\n","72, 0.7430535852909088, Great service provided by our waiter Richard. He was friendly and attentive.  We ordered a variety of food and the prawns was the best and the club sandwich.  The chicken is halal which is great. The main attraction is the views. \n","73, 0.6770320739064898, Don't bother attending this restaurant. Especially for breakfast.  I had this reserved months in advance, a table for two, on a Saturday morning. Knowing full well what to expect and genuinely had high hopes.  So, my girlfriend and I arrive. Go up to the restaurant, seated, provided with menus, look around to see what everyone else is eating and the quality of the food. The price they are charging for breakfast is absolutely ridiculous.  You know what, I know we weren't guests of the hotel, but having made the booking in December, I thought maybe we would be welcomed to sit in the outside sheltered area. If we were then yes I would have paid for the meal because it's part of the experience. So you know what. I drank my Macchiato, paid £4.50, and politely asked the waitress to remove the service charge (on a coffee!), and left.  If you nip into Covent Garden, which by the way is just around the corner, you will find absolutely fabulous restaurants for breakfast.  Thanks, but no thanks.\n","74, 0.642924593716133, Got to the rooftop and engaged with a staff member re the beautiful sunset to be met with “you can’t go out there we are setting up for a private function”. Not a positive entrance. They sat me down and 20 seconds later asked what I wanted. I asked for another minute but after 10 no one came. I walked out. No one even noticed or tried to ask why. Had dinner at the steak restaurant and noticed staff outside in the lobby standing around in a group. Laughing and ignoring guests. Food art restaurant and service there saved the day. The rest off he place needs some attention to detail\n","75, 0.7147494666278362, Good service and friendly staff. Lovely food. Was a Saturday night - DJ played great music. Drinks were reasonably high in price but to a high standard. Only downside is that we couldn't really appreciate the views from where we were seated.\n","76, 0.767110342687031, Great views over London, lovely ambience, staff very attentive. We all had the rib eye steak, between us we ordered medium, medium well and well done - all were cooked to the exact requirements! Lovely friendly staff. As the afternoon drew into the evening and the London lights started to come on, it was even lovelier, the area we sat in has heating which made it very cosy - I think that bit is opened up in the summer which I imagine is amazing as well! We really enjoyed it and had a lovely time! \n","77, 0.6627642810344696, First time there with 5 friends. First impressions blow your mind - def worth a visit just for the view. But just have a couple of drinks and go eat elsewhere. Food is expensive, luke warm, veryediocre \n","78, 0.7488294201237815, We had an early dinner with my friend, a couple of drinks, we were the tipical annoying customers. The waiter csaba it turned out he is Hungarian too, like us....he was amazing very polite and really helpful....2nd time here and I love the place, high standards :)\n","79, 0.5919840235162426, we booked Friday 6 December the table on the terrace very nice and stylish place. but unfortunately on the horrible experience terrace we arrived at 12.30 immediately we ordered 5 drinks and 2 bottles of champagne( cost plus 300 paunds ) but they arrived at the table only 3 drinks and champagne after 45 minutes of waiting.to remember that at 2am closes so I call to the manager and asking for explanations why only 3 drinks and no 5 and he could not handle the very embarrassing situation with my friends because we were 5 two I did not drink extra they charged 10 pounds for 2 bowls of peanuts without any service. To remember we only had 20 minutes to drinks . I've turned many places but such a management disorder I've never seen in my life that I wouldn't recommend\n","80, 0.7075245951612791, Love this place - the views of the city are incredible and it has a lovely ambience. The staff are welcoming and accommodating to your needs although service can be slow sometimes - it can get very busy so perhaps they just need more staff on.\n","81, 0.6441893607937299, We visited yesterday evening at around 5pm and to be honest we were absolutely disgusted by the service. There were 3 of us two of us 21 and one 18. When we arrived we were asked if we had a reservation in which we didn’t. The lady asked us for our ages and then explained that it was an over 21 policy after 5pm. Which we completely understand but she spoke to her manger and they had said we could have a table for an hour and it was ok to go in although one was 18. We were seated at the bar ( which can I add there were plently of people who didn’t have reservations that were allocated nice tables to sit at, I think this is very out of order to sit us at the bar out of the way when we would be paying the same as any other person in there that were having drinks)  We sat at the bar for around 15 minutes and the bar men behind the bar did not ask once if we would like a drink. We were then asked about 20 mins after being sat there to be told again that it was an over 21 policy and he would have to check with his manager if this was ok. By this point we had been sat there without a drink and made to feel VERY unwelcome. Your bar staff in particular were rude.  We completely understand that you have the over 21 policy in place and completely respect that but it was the fact we were told we could come in and have a drink to be sat there for 20 minutes and then be interrogated again about our ages. I know full well we look young but we did all have ID and me and my sister are in fact 21. We have stayed at the ME hotel previously which we could not fault and it is such a shame that your staff were so rude and we were made to feel so uncomfortable as it is a lovely place to have a drink.\n","82, 0.5871404642911301, This place had been on my bar bucket list for years. Afterall, it is well known for having a rooftop bar on the 10th floor of this stylish hotel.  One thing to note though is that looking out to the views won't be as good as in the summer given the plastic style windows. This is a contained space so dont expect blankets and cold air in your face.  Overall, good service and cocktails but it didn`t feel particularly special despite the views. One for summertime. \n","83, 0.5520503916507102, I was greeted by a lovely man at the main entrance who was so kind .I wish he was my waiter .He was so welcoming. I was so convinced that my experience will be amazing. However upon reaching upstairs to the restaurant itself, I was so disappointed. I wanted to actually leave but we travelled far so we were obligated to stay. I was sat by a lady who handed me two menus (brunch menu and a la carte menu)...  Next thing I know another waiter came and demanded for my bank card. I asked him why as i already gave my bank details upon booking over the phone. He was so rude and told me its the policy and that I should know this. No one told me this when i booked it but i still gave him my card . He came again to take our drink order and i told him im not feeling well as i have flu, and if he could tell the bartender to put less ice in my drink. Again he was rude and said it always comes with ice . I've been to several rooftops in London and never experience such lack of hospitality . Upon having received our drinks we ordered our food with him and he said we could only order from the brunch menu .I asked him why as the lady who sat me down gave me two menus. I then asked him if the steak is beef or pork as i dont eat pork. He looked at me like I know nothing and said of course it's beef. After that another waiter took over as i think the other one had finished his shift. However even if it was towards the end of his shift, he shouldn't be this rude.\n","84, 0.5200394053716917, Visited Radio bar for a cocktail, on reaching the 10th floor the staff member waiting was so cold and miserable with no eye contact that I wanted to turn round and leave. Cocktails were ok , but wouldn’t return as bar was soulless with staff obviously not happy to be working there. It’s a real shame as this venue could be amazing if it had the correct management.\n","85, 0.7186514270014879, Popped in for a quick drink after dinner nearby. Lovely space with very attentive staff. Would be cheaper to go to the local pub BUT definitely not the same views!  Would love to come back for food.\n","86, 0.638335197202621, Went for dinner , food was ok ... very limited menu and prob wouldn’t go back . Great views of the River but not sure it’s worth the price \n","87, 0.6713122463431852, We had reserved in advance - and given credit card details in case of no show. Initial impressions not good as we were shown to the ‘outdoor’ bar to a coffee table / sofa which didn’t look ideal for dinner - then we were shown to an equivalent inside and then in a light bulb moment we were offered a table in the main dining area! Menu is limited but quality was good. Alpine sharing board followed a generous portion of salmon. Food good. Also cocktails but £17 is expensive. Enjoyed the view (Shard to London Eye) and the food but unlikely to rush back\n","88, 0.6347377359867096, Interesting choice and getting in is fun as clearly it is the place to be --not! Ok inside but views in the evening are poor as the plastic outer balcony window covers severely impact the clarity. Was kept inside even though clearly there was room outside on the terrace. House red (OK) , cocktail (v good) and house champagne with 12.5% so called discretionary came to c £50--hmmmm. Probably great for summer. Waiting staff and bouncers downstairs were fine -- felt honoured we were not asked for our credit card upfront which seems to be a sort of policy--makes you wonder why.... \n","89, 0.7168267824583583, Nice staff, working hard, but this place is for tourists. The view South and East across to the city is great but the other compass points are pretty ordinary.  Two cocktails, £17 quid each on the menu, with service charge the bill was £36. Food on menu looked ordinary but expensive. There are better places to eat, drink and see London\n","90, 0.7766606344117059, we went for a drink with my friends and we found the place incredible with good views and good service, especially samantha was really frienly  Thanks\n","91, 0.6484892661847061, My sister and I recently visited this bar. We quite enjoyed it, our servers name was Zsolt (hope I spelt that correctly) He was excellent, extremely polite and his customer service was outstanding.  However we did make a reservation and they put us to share a couch with another table which I found to be very uncomfortable. I asked the lady who seated us if there was anything else available and she said no but I felt an attitude with her answer which made me feel very uncomfortable. Later on in the night we were finishing our bottle of red wine when another waitress came up to us and said our time is up and we have to leave soon because someone else needed our seat. (How rude and unprofessional) She then realized that the couple that was sharing the couch/table with us was in fact not with us and they were here much longer than we were and I’m assuming that message was for them and not for my sister and I. Overall good food and drink. Doubt I would come back.\n","92, 0.8675487502054735, This is definitively the place to be in London. Drinks and food are very high quality. We have been very lucky to have Samantha this evening. Samantha is an outstanding, professional person, a real best in class waitress.\n","93, 0.6932120794473693, I’ve visited Radio Rooftop bar with friends. We did not have a reservation, however the hostess at the entrance (could not get her name unfortunately) was quite accommodating and quicky found a table for us. We had a lovely glass of champagne each and delicious cocktails. One of the managers: German, offered us some great bites which were perfectly matching the cocktails which we choose beforehand.  Overall great experience. Looking forward to come back. \n","94, 0.8890767792860667, Had a great time, Samantha Buisson was a lovely host - Made us feel like home. Wonderful rooftop view overseeing London.\n","95, 0.7245937063505775, As this is one of our favourite places in London, we do frequent Radio often enough, although this evening merits a special mention.  Firstly, the lovely Finnish lady (Sala?) by the lifts always greets us with a the most warm welcome that it already makes you feel like you’re coming “home”. It was just the third time that I met her but she already remembered and greeted me by name before I even mention my booking - this is hospitality in its perfection.  When we arrived at Radio, we didn’t even say who we are, we simply were shown to our table-with-a-view. Nothing better than a seamless entry!  As a creature of habit, we ended up ordering the same food: the edamame was more tasty though and so were the deliciously creamy croquets! And there’s nothing better than to finish with the divinely addictive churros.  Our waiters, Zsolt and Richardo, could not have looked after us any better: Zsolt always served us with a bright smile and recommended us a few other dishes. Richardo, is always as warm and friendly as ever.  But it’s not only the waiters that looked after us all night - the management team also cared for us to no end. Fabio always comes over to greet us and have a chat with us even in the busiest period. Gleb always insist that he is at our disposal should we wish to request anything.  It is truly the people that make a place worth coming back again and again for. Ever since my friends and I came here for the first time at the end of March and certainly since the summer party, we’ve been coming at least every month! I sincerely want to thank the entire team (Fabio, German, Gleb, Antoine, Angelo, Richardo, Samantha, Sala) for always being so welcoming and for your generosity and hospitality - and for making Radio feel like a second home. Wishing you a most wonderful Christmas and a prosperous New Year 2020! x\n","96, 0.6961465917364524, I came last Monday night to enjoy my free time in Radio and I’ve been satisfied as usual inasmuch the location is amazing (one of my favorite in London) and service was amazing too. My friend and I had a bottle of Rioja Sierra Cantabria (well recommended) and on top of this Lorena’s service was brilliant! She has been very helpful and friendly with us through the night and when we’ve got the second bottle, this one was tasting different comparing with the first one(it can happen anywhere with any type of wine),so she took care of us and this gesture made us happier even more than we already were! I’ll definitely be back as soon as I can!\n","97, 0.6727409225243789, We didn't eat here but we did stay at the Me hotel so we used this bar twice for drinks with friends, its fantastic really modern staff are friendly and they have a great range of drinks, The balcony is also lovely you can sit outside as they cover the area so its not cold. Would definitely recommend for drinks!\n","98, 0.8208924863073561, To begin with I would like to thank the Italian lady that served us (5) the entire time we were there. Really pleased with the drinks, snacks and food. The service was outstanding and professional but at the same time had a little touch of warmth and friendliness that made us feel very welcome and prioritized. Overall absolutely loved it! Will definitely recommend and indeed will be back! Thank You for everything!\n","99, 0.8192688822746277, One of the best nights since I’m in London, atmosphere nice, the wine that I drank it was very tasty and Lorena gave one service like waiter superb !! I will come back surely!\n","100, 0.8312251581387087, This rooftop is one of the best roof in London. The atmosphere is calm and we can enjoy the decoration style with the Christmas’s trees.
