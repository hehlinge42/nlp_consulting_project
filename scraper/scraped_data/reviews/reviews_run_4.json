The small public bar has a dart board, fruit machine, and, when I visited, a group of loud-mouthed, shaven-headed, heavily tattooed, young men \"effing and blinding\" copiously. There are only three tables, two of which were occupied by old men reading the Racing Post and listening to horse-racing commentaries, while the third was taken-up by a couple with a dog.  I abandoned the idea of having lunch here, drank my beer as quickly as possible, and drove to Wetherspoons at Ruislip Manor where, fortunately, they have sufficient tables to accommodate their customers as well as a wider choice of beer and food at cheaper prices.

The chicken was absolutely amazing! My husband had the beef tenderloin which also included a plate full of lovely roasted vegetables. This dish was also amazing, cooked to perfection as requested by husband. Our friend had the half duck. We all thought this dish was a bit dry. This was the only less than perfect dish we had. We left after selecting a few chocolates from the bakery.

The sandwiches were nothing special, the scones have shrunk and lost their signature flavour and the cakes we're just boring! The brownie even had a smell of other cooking.

We had been concerned about this change in ownership and were proved right today.  We couldn\u2019t fault our host (Casper), who was lovely but would definitely think twice before we book again.

Please see the photos provided and decide whether that is worth \u00a370 plus a service charge of \u00a38.25 The cakes were dry and basically looked shop bought and the scones were hard.

We asked to speak to someone in charge before we left but were told the manager was in a meeting, but would telephone us Two days later and still waiting we emailed the head office but no response from them either.

Fancy cakes did look nice, however some of the tastes and texture did not up to expectation. The room had no atmosphere, felt very silent at time and no background music, no flowers on table.

For many years we have been coming to great fosters for meals/afternoon tea to celebrate birthdays ect. However in the last few months on both occasions we have been let down. Firstly in April when we came for the Easter wreath workshop. The Easter wreath workshop was lovely but the meal included was disappointing. We had ordered our meals but my godmothers order had been taken down incorrectly. We had got our steaks but were waiting for the chips before starting to eat. Then a waiter came out and said he had my godmothers down as salmon. He took her steak away and gave to another client and then gave her salmon. My godmother had ordered steak but did not want to make a fuss. This is awful customer service and you would not expect this at a four star hotel. Who takes a dish from a customer to give to another customer because they have mucked up the orders? Furthermore the steak I had was cold.  Now today we received poor service for our afternoon tea. Not the service we had been used to. Firstly the service was slow and then when the tea arrived it was strong and stewed. We had to ask for extra hot water. Then we had to ask for extra sandwiches and even then was told I couldn\u2019t have a cucumber one. Whereas before we were always offered an abundance of extra sandwiches. Also the sandwiches were dry and the coronation chicken one came in a tough roll which required to be gnawed at.  We also had to ask for fresh plates post savoury for our sweets.- when normally waiters would instinctively offer fresh plates because who wants to eat a scone of a plate smeared in coronation chicken. We also had to ask to take home the cakes and were given brown boxes where we had to put them in. Whereas previously we would have been asked if we would like to take them home and they would have been whisked off to kitchen and then they came back in lovely pink great fosters boxes with handles.  We were never offered extra tea or asked if we wanted more drinks.  Also there was no one at the door on arrival to help us through the door and direct us. There were 3 young men as we left who were more concerned with themselves then their duties.  We were used to attentive good service at great fosters but now that is not the case. Seems the new managers care little for customer service and are pleased with the changes they have made. As the response I recieved from a feedback email was \u2018We have made changes to the afternoon tea in itself which we are happy with and for which we have received some lovely feedback\u2019. Who is giving feedback I do not know.  Do not visit here as the new managers have ruined the once prestigious reputation that GF used to uphold.", "date_of_review": "14 June 2019"}

Great Fosters has been one of our favourite hotels for many years. However our experience yesterday was very disappointing. The high standards of service that we have received in the past are gone. We waited a long time to be served, the tea when it eventually arrived was stewed and had to request additional pots of tea and clean cups and plates. There was no offer of additional sandwiches as in the past and no Victoria sponge and not value for money. Service was slow and the staff not attentive. In addition the changes to the decor are not sympathetic to the age and feel of an historic building. The new reception area sticks out like a sore thumb in a once beautiful great hall.

Our arrival was amazing (I did have a Chauffeur take us there) and we were warmly welcomed and seated by the water and in some shade. The Afternoon Tea was amazing, my friend was so impressed but she has never been for Afternoon Tea before, whereas I have enjoyed Afternoon Tea throughout the world but Great Fosters did me proud. Olivia, our (lovely) waitress asked when we would like our glass of Champagne. We had it served early on and then ordered another two glasses. We very much enjoyed the selection of sandwiches and cakes although took a lot of the cakes with us, much to the delight of my Partner.

We visited today for a friend's birthday but left feeling sorely disappointed and ripped off. The price of afternoon tea had increased from \u00a327 to \u00a337 and consisted of five finger sandwiches (equal to about two and a half slices of bread), two scones with cream and jam and a few miniature patisseries. The tea was unlimited but this was little consolation. The service was also well below par. When we were seated initially, we were told in no uncertain terms that our time was limited to two hours. Great start to the afternoon! When we asked for extra sandwiches, our request was ignored. One member of our party didn't receive her pot of tea and, when we asked the waiter for it, we watched him go out into the foyer and flap his arms in a temper. One member of our party is vegetarian and another allergic to nuts, however, when the food arrived, the two special orders had been combined as one and given to the vegetarian. This meant that the lady with a nut allergy was given food that could have caused a severe allergic reaction. Just not good enough! The place has also recently been redecorated and, in our opinion, has now lost all it's historical charm and quaintness.

What a disappointment! Firstly they have totally ruined the atmosphere with their modern furnishings and decor. Gone are the wonderful old pieces of furniture and tasteful period decor. The new reception desk looks like any you would see in a modern day chain hotel. Also it was cold a drizzling yesterday but now welcoming fire like you would have seen previously! The staff were pleasant enough but nowhere near as friendly and welcoming as the old staff. In the past every guest that stepped through the door was made to feel so special, it was always a wonderful treat to visit. The grounds still look lovely but they should be ashamed at the state of the swimming pool. It was fifthly with algae and dead leaves floating on it. Afternoon tea has increased in price but was rather disappointing. Firstly they don\u2019t seem to know how to serve a decent cup of tea anymore. Earl Grey so strong it was like builders tea. We waited ages for our tea, which actually arrived after the sandwiches and cakes and tasted like it was stewed. Three pots later for me and pots of hot water for my friends to keep the tea hot and water it down, I finally managed to drink it without a nasty taste. The sandwiches were nowhere near as nice as usual and we had to ask for more, rather than being offered anymore. No Victoria Sandwich and scones that were literally half the size and cold. They used to arrive warm and were so light and so big. The patisserie was a disappointment too. Sickly sweet and nowhere near as fine as we used to get. A lot got left as it was not to everyone\u2019s taste. I also picked up rubbish in reception. Some plastic packaging that several staff stepped over as they went through.

One of the first things you saw when you entered the hotel was the beautiful foral arrangement, which was changed weekly, now gone completely. The new Reception Desk and grey carpet is completely out of character for a building that is nearly 500 years old. If the new owners continue in this vein they will ruin this beautiful hotel.

We were greeted by an absolutely lovely lady who chatted to us for a while discussing the history of the hotel and we also spoke to some other lovely staff there. Sadly I have to say that our afternoon tea was ruined entirely by our waiter. We ordered 2 Pims afternoon teas and 1 vegetarian afternoon tea with mojito for myself. It became clear towards the end of the sandwiches that possibly the waiter had forgotten my veggie sandwiches. I actually had to share the sandwiches of my Mum and boyfriend as I was starving. After having 2 separate conversations about the missing sandwiches with the waiter I was brought a few veggie sandwiches that arrived at the same time as our deserts. He agreed they had been forgotten but blamed another waiter. The whole point of afternoon tea is to sample some tea...and our tea and coffee only arrived after asking a few times by which point our deserts were well and truly finished. In the end, the table having never been emptying, the bill arrived and the waiter seemed oblivious to the fact that this was all unacceptable. I mentioned again the fact I was disappointed about the sandwiches and he removed the service charge (wow and entire \u00a312), made a joke and left with barely an apology. At \u00a3120 I expect much more than this. I didn\u2019t want to create a scene so we called a taxi and left. The other staff were lovely and cocktails and food all very good.

Such a disappointing experience this time. Table wasn't ready for our booking on our arrival and we were told to wait in the room by the sides of other people already dining whilst our table was prepared. The Tudor room wasn't available for afternoon tea this time apparently, so instead we were finally seated in the Cocktail bar room at a table which had a constant flow of waiters and waitresses filing past in close proximity with food and drink orders for other tables - not very relaxing or conducive for what should have been a relaxing afternoon tea. The Tudor room makes for a much better afternoon tea venue in my opinion. We were also witness to some of the staff blaming each other for various misunderstandings at the cocktail bar too - very unprofessional conduct. Food was fine, but our order for a second pot of tea each to accompany our scones and cakes endured a 30 minute wait. All in all we felt forgotten, details on or initial order were missed and we felt that the service and ambience had much to be desired. Understandably we chose not to pay the service charge which had been added to our bill. I complained to the front desk on leaving and was told that it was because it was the weekend and busy. Our previous experience had also been on a weekend, so clearly not a good enough reason for such a bad experience this time.

We sat by the moat on a beautiful summer afternoon. The food quality was excellent as was the selection on hand. The service, however, left a lot to be desired.

If it hadn\u00b4t been for one waiter, who although not allocated to our table, was aware that we were kept waiting too long, our tea would not have been such a nice experience. Also, if you have coffee instead of tea, getting a refill is again not very easy. In short we had to make too much of the running to get served, not good!!!!

This has to be one of the very best afternoon teas ever, in quantity, quality and location.We got a warm friendly welcome and were shown in to the garden for our tea. Without exception, the staff were friendly but not over-familiar, very funny and totally charming. The sandwiches were fresh and delicious and we were offered more (tip: take all you want on seconds as it won't come again - however, be careful because the following cakes and scones are enormous!). There is a good range of tea to select (no Assam or Ceylon however. An oversight?) We both chose Darjeeling. Then come the cakes - fresh, moist and varied. The scones are warm and quite honestly the best I can remember tasting (we are old hands at afternoon teas,in many select locations) and the cream is plentiful and very thick, as is the jam. I also liked that we were told then and there not to worry about the amount as they would box up any we couldn't eat. We needed the boxes! On top of this the gardens are totally wonderful - OK, it was a warm and sunny day but do give yourself enough time to explore. The atmosphere is wonderful, warm and friendly like the staff, and I expected to see the White Rabbit hurry past and to turn a corner and see Alice chatting with the March Hare and the Hatter.

The cakes were also good, but being such a hot day a few had heated and melted but that wasn't the hotel's fault really- it was a scorcher! The only thing we would have liked is a little more shade, but like I said this day was a scorcher. The scones were the best I've had (and I've had a lot!) there wasn't that drying aftertaste you usually get and they were light and well risen. We ordered the pink raspberry G&T AT, but they had run out of the elderflower tonic so we had to have regular- I think the elderflower tonic would have \"made\" the drink.

The Woodman is on the outskirts of Ruislip, near to the Crematorium, as suburbia gives way to countryside. What strikes me most, on each visit, is the genuinely warm welcome that you receive. The pub consists of a a cosy public bar, tastefully decorated and welcoming and a lounge, as well as a spacious outside area beautifully bedecked with flower beds and hanging baskets.  The lounge is regularly in use for private functions during the day, doing a good trade from the nearby crematorium. Food is served at lunchtimes Monday to Saturday and is well worth a visit. There is a good range of traditional pub food and lighter snacks - including a soup of the day. Fish finger sandwich and chips is my guilty pleasure, but everything is prepared with real care, reasonably priced and served with a smile.  A gem!", "date_of_review": "23 August 2017"}

Miegal our waiter for the afternoon, was friendly but not intrusive, balancing attentiveness while allowing us a leisurely afternoon, catching up with a friend.  I loveeee afternoon tea and this one goes to the top of my list, surpassing top London 5 star hotels. Firstly, if you want to have an alcoholic tipple along side a lovely range of hot drinks, from a English sparkling wine, to champagne, Pimms and our choice Gin.  The actual tea, beautiful fresh sandwiches, with a top up on offer, traditional scones, warm, crumbly and melt in the mouth. Then a Victoria Sandwich for two, finally a plate of fancies, and to my delight, choux bun ( banana toffee) , Lemon and passion fruit meringue shortcrust tart, chocolate opera cake, pink ( raspberry?) macroon Alomond and moose cake and finally mini battenburg!!!  We certainly needed to walk off the sugar rush, and we escaped into the wonderful gardens, due to the age of the building, you do need to go round the houses to get to them in the wheelchair, but once again it was no trouble to be shown the route once again by the top man. This willingness I am sure is the leadership that leads the rest of the staff to follow.

I booked an afternoon tea for four of us, 2pm on Sunday. The experience was magical from the moment we drove into the car park.  There was a butler at the entrance, who greeted us and showed us in. The estate is amazing, beautiful and I already wish to return just for the experience.  Upon entrance to the left, there is a room where high tea area is, and to the right, there is a huge three piece suite in front of a beautiful fire. We were seated there by a very attentive and proud member of the staff who informed us she had worked there 20 years and gushed about how much she loved her work. This had us all smiling, as I believe first impressions count!  Once our table was ready, we were taken through and had an open view into the garden. You couldn't have asked for a better seat, as I think we were allocated the best!  Caspar served us our high tea and went into much detail explaining each experience and we decided to go with the Pimms High Tea at \u00a340 per head. Worth every penny I can tell you now. The sandwich round, they could have kept bringing over as everything we were served tasted so good! We even had extra sandwiches.  After a little break, we had our sweet round and ordered some mango noir tea that Caspar had recommended. Then along came the warm scones with clotted cream and jam, Victoria sponge, little pastries and cakes; traditional afternoon tea items. My friends ended up getting a takeaway box as we were all so stuffed. You will leave this experience, with a *very* full belly, a warmed heart and a desire to return very soon.

The Drawing Room was quiet but comfortable and we had the bay window sofa awaiting us. Lovely surroundings but slightly stiff in atmosphere.  Driving precluded the alcohol so we were straight into the finger sandwiches followed by the cake stand. Standard choices, smoked salmon, roast beef, egg, cucumber etc. but very tasty and refills if you can manage. Scones with jam and clotted cream, Victoria sponge, mini cakes and tarts. I had a sugar-free stand although I still found it too sweet for my taste - but filling to the point of doggy bags. However, I found the sugar-free raspberry jam for the scones was very nice, fresh and true to the natural fruit. Teas from an excellent choice - with regular topping up and refills by the server and every attention to our requirements. Service was excellent. Dinner in the Estate Grill on Saturday evening was very busy but one we often enjoy. On this occasion, for me, the menu choices were not quite so appealing, neither starters nor main course, but there is always the Butchers Block, Josper steak and lobster to fall back on. Some dishes didn't quite work as hoped for us but we always enjoy the opulent Tudor setting and surroundings. The dishes are beautifully presented, the food is fresh and excellent quality and service is always first class.  It is moderately expensive but reflects the nature of the hotel and setting and to be honest is not so different from many quality restaurants nor hotels for afternoon tea and there is a bonus to be seen in the grounds.

And this seems to be the trend in recent years. It was a special treat for myself and three friends to celebrate two babies on the way and have a well earned mummy break from our toddlers at home. The main issue is the 2 hr slot window they now work off, as you are just left feeling like your on a conveyor belt, which shouldn't be the case for the \u00a330 a head classic cream tea. The cakes took over an hour to get out to us. Tea replacements had to be chased. The place was packed as usual with the added pressure of a wedding going on else where in the building. We thought we'd been offered an extension to 4pm due to the delay. But this was just a misinformed member of staff and we were thrown off the table by a senior member of staff. I appreciate this is the system but a 2 hour slot is not long enough. 2.5hr perhaps? The other issue was communication - I had called ahead and asked if we could do anything special to the table as was informed I would only be permitted up to 2 balloons and nothing else. A well meaning customer service agent did offer to do two chocolate plates with 'congratulations' which I confirmed on the day, but these never appeared. Rather embarrassingly as the host, I arrived to find a friends husband had arranged beautiful flowers from a local florist and a bottle of champagne from the venue as a surprise for his pregnant wife. So very thoughtful, but it would have been great if the venue had mentioned this had been arranged when I called in that day.

I have been here before anyway. The gardens are worth a wander around but unsurprisingly the teenage contingent were not that bothered. It took a while for someone to come and take our order and when I mentioned that one of the children could not do any sandwiches with mayonnaise the staff were not particularly forthcoming in offering suggestions. If you have people that are picky with fillings on sandwiches, the hotel doesn't seem that able to do a simple cheese or ham sandwich (this option was not offered to us). Teas and drinks were ordered but we had already eaten the sandwiches before the tea and hot chocolates arrived. When the hot chocolates did arrive they were luke warm as they had been obviously sitting for a while on the counter top. However, once these issues were sorted, we had a huge amount of food. We had additional sandwiches, beautiful scones and lovely raspberry jam. The cakes were plentiful and we were offered more tea whenever we wished. We even took home cardboard boxes filled with cakes. The setting was lovely, the room really nice, but some of the service and problem solving could of been better.

To follow a very inviting cake stand comprising warm scones, a Victoria sponge cake and a selection of mini cakes most of which we took home as we were so full after the Victoria sponge. The service was impeccable, not rushed and served with a smile. My only gripe was the flavouring of the mini cakes. One was liquorice and the lemon meringue and the ginger cake only raced of mixed spice. This in no way spoiled our tea. I would highly recommend going here.

Despite it being busy and packed with customers, the helpful staff were more than happy to provide our party of fifteen with drinks all round and also a wide range of very freshly-made sandwiches which were truly delicious. What was also impressive was that the locals were very tolerant of (and probably used to) the continual flow and ebb of non-regulars from the crematorium and the atmosphere was friendly and welcoming. The pub and the toilets were spotless and empty glasses and crockery were almost instantly collected so that the tables were clean and ready for use again. There are also seats and tables outside the pub which would be lovely in good weather. The prices, range and excellent quality of refreshments on offer were very fair and fresh and I applaud the Woodman for their faultless customer service, and their honesty and not taking advantage of their location by serving poor highly priced produce to a captive clientele.

Service was a bit of hit and miss and the staff did not seem to communicate very well with each other. This was meant to be a treat for my 82 year old mother, who lives abroad and was visiting for the weekend. We arrived on time and had to wait for our table to be set up, which we would not have minded if at the end of the two hour slot we were not being rushed to leave. We ordered a Pimms afternoon tea, but the Pimms did not arrive until about twenty minutes after the sandwiches and tea. So we were already in the middle of eating sandwiches and drinking tea when we were finely able to have a toast. We asked the waiter for a couple extra sandwiches, which took so long to arrive that the other waitress assumed we had finished and started clearing our plates. Having to wait for the sandwiches meant we had less time left for cakes and only managed to eat one each when the waitress asked if she could put the rest in a box for us, gently hinting we should have been finishing by now. A few minutes later the waiter reminded us our two hour slot was up so I asked for the bill, coats and tried to get mum, who was still finishing her tea, out of the bar area as quickly as possible. Luckily, my mum, who does not speak much English, did not fully understand what was going on, but I was deeply disappointed with the experience. ", "date_of_review": "17 October 2017"}

It's also relaxingly quiet, so easy to have conversations without having to raise your voice over intrusive music or echos from reflective surfaces. Service is impeccable and attentive; nothing is too much trouble. The range of teas is extensive and exciting, sandwich fillings are perfect, and each one is in a different type of bread. The cakes are just delicate, beautiful and tasty. The vegetarian and vegan options are equally wonderful.There's always more than one can eat, and it's assumed you'll take the remainder home as cake cartons are brought to the table without asking.

The positives - polite and attentive staff, good food, beautiful building, and a lovely walk in the grounds afterwards.  The negatives - too-loud background music, which was turned down when we asked. - uncomfortable seating, with chair and sofa very different heights & not right for the low table (the chair was changed on request). - we asked for our tea to be served after our prosecco and it was served at the same time. - NOT ENOUGH CREAM for the scones in a cream tea!!!! We were served 6 scones and one small ball of clotted cream. We were served a second ball on request, but when we asked again we were told they had run out. So we ended up with scones and jam for our second round. It was mid afternoon, so I can't imagine what happened with later guests.  - and finally, one of the reasons I like the place so much is that they have always returned to the table with offers of more sandwiches, until you say 'enough'. This time we were only offered seconds of sandwiches, and then our plates were removed to bring out the cakes and scones.  All in all it felt a little less generous and special, not such good value for money (not cheap) & rather poorly organised.  Not so sure I'll be revisiting. ", "date_of_review": "7 September 2017"}

In over 30 years we have only given the full 10, 3 times, and the last was for Great Fosters. I honestly couldn't find a single thing that wasn't perfect, from the food to the tea and to the excellent service. You could show the best London hotels a thing or 2 ! ( I recently had tea at a 5 star hotel in London at great expense and gave it 7 ! ).Many thanks", "date_of_review": "5 September 2017"}

I booked a table for 10 people two weeks in advance. Five days before a lady called me asking if this booking is confirmed, because they have 10 other people eager to take this place (!?). For my own peace of mind I paid a deposit next day. On Sunday, the day of booking, we came to decorate the table for baby shower. There were only a handful of people in the restaurant, it was before 1pm and the restaurant wasn\u2019t busy yet. I ordered a beer, but after 15 minutes I was still waiting. When asked I was told it\u2019s being poured(!) While one of the girls was still eating a starter, the waitress came up to me asking if she can start serving main course (!) It still did not dawn on me that they were trying to get rid of us quickly. Everything cleared up a few minutes later, when the same waitress came up in the middle of our meal and quietly informed me that they have another reservation for 4pm and we were a little bit late ... I was astonished! True, some of our party was late (our pregnant girl with her sister and a friend. She\u2019s forgiven, as she wasn\u2019t feeling very well) but it does not mean that if they came on time we would have left earlier, which is what I said. The food was generally good, but some of the dishes were lukewarm rather than hot. It was a baby shower and apart from lunch, we had planned various games and were not in a hurry to leave, especially since some of the girls came from quite far. The waitress was nice and I suppose it was not her fault she had to tell me what she did, but an hour or so later we heard her apologize to the table next to us, saying 'they thought we would have left by now'! If the ladies informed me when I was booking that they needed the table at certain time this would be fine, but coming in the middle of the meal is out of order. Just as they should have ask for a deposit when taking the reservation and not call a few days before, telling me that they have other eager diners. I suspect this is when the restaurant double booked.  Although we wanted to stay longer and chat more, we didn\u2019t feel welcome, so we moved to a pub down the road and carried on.  Unfortunately, this is not the first time in Sowa that I feel as if they\u2019re doing me a favour that I can eat there. Service is nice when everything is ok. As soon as something goes wrong, you get sulkiness and an attitude from waitresses. Forget about a smile or hearing \"sorry\". We chose Sowa because our pregnant friend likes this place very much and that's the only reason.  I have stopped going there a long time ago, mainly due to poor service and food being a bit of hit and miss in the past, due to frequent changes and \u2018improving\u2019 classic dishes.", "date_of_review": "26 November 2018"}

The venue is beautiful and it's enjoyable to be able to walk around the extensive grounds before/after your tea. The staff are always very friendly and attentive. I think the gluten free afternoon tea selection is by far the best I've had anywhere. The sandwiches are excellent and there's a good selection of cakes and scones. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because this time I didn't get as much of a selection of sandwiches as I have had before (although the ones I had were enjoyable). Also, I was slightly surprised to pay a service charge this time where I hadn't before. I think the last time I visited I actually purchased the afternoon tea as a voucher on the Great Fosters website beforehand and presented it upon paying, whereas this time I booked and paid the bill when I finished. Although both situations amounted to the same result, I was surprised to have to have to pay a service charge second time around.

Our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing. The atmosphere was lovely and we were seated outside. The grounds are immaculately kept and provide a beautiful backdrop for the meal. The tea and sandwiches were exquisite, especially the smoked salmon on beetroot bread. The scones were the best I've ever had, neither dense nor claggy, and generous amounts of cream and jam were laid on.  So why only 4 stars? Well, at \u00a330 per person I feel I have a right to be fussy, and the cakes let the side down. The chocolate tart was rough around the edges and bitter. The chocolate and pistachio cake was average at best. Local patisseries in France can do a better job and charge a fraction of the price. These are minor quibbles and all in all it was a fabulous afternoon. Top marks for the tea, sandwiches, scones and service. Just the cakes need a tiny bit of refining in my opinion.

Also, not given milk and missing cutlery on table. However, once we did get our food, it was very nice, with as many sandwiches as you could eat, though not all amazing. Nice selection of teas and coffee. Patisserie and scones very nice, Victoria sponge not the greatest - sponge rather stiff.

At Great Fosters we found the sandwiches, scones and cakes to be good but the service was rather a let-down (eg water poured on the table cloth and just left there; hot water served in a teapot that still had gunk in it from previous use, even at the second attempt: the waiter noticed the first time and went away to sort it out, but ignored the black bits in the water on the second attempt).

Two others shared a mushroom Pierogi (8 pieces which was too much as a starter for 2 people) very tasty. I had the Wild Boar Pierogi for main, which although nice, I wished I had a main as per the other three. Variously pork knuckle, pork chop and a fish dish: massive, filling tasty portions and presentation way above what I expected here. 2 of us had desserts: a selection of 3 cheesecakes and a selection of 3 apple desserts ( strudel, pie and apple chocolate cake).

Lovely waitress offered to provide a medley plate containing all three . Soup was terrific carrot & corriander. My favourite of the Pierogis was the meat, least enjoyable was mushroom & sauerkraut. Just as we had starfed eating another waitress asked if we wanted sour cream as it went well with the cheese & potato Pierogi. 12.5% discretionery included on bill, which I would normally gripe about but in this case the service was over and above standard so I had no complaints at all.

We ordered the Pimms afternoon tea. As soon as the Pimms arrived so did our tea and coffee and sandwiches. I think it would have been more apt for us to enjoy our Pimms before having the tea was served. The service was good but initially a bit too attentive. For the first 15 minutes there always seemed to be at least two people hanging around our table, giving us no private time. Sandwiches delicious, scones warm with clotted cream and jam, and the cakes beautiful and tasty. Far too much food but attractive little boxes brought the left overs home. Altogether an enjoyable afternoon.", "date_of_review": "31 March 2017"}

The hotel is stunningly beautiful being Grade 1 listed and of Tudor age, so a delight for any history buffs. The setting is also delightful especially as we were blessed with sunny weather. The afternoon tea was faultless as was the service. Our only disappointment being that we were unable to finish the sumptuous cakes, so these were boxed and taken home instead.

Children are welcome, the youngest member of our party was 4 years old, the staff made such an effort to make it a lovely experience for all of us. The Afternoon Tea itself was excellent. They have several options as well as a standard afternoon tea, which can be mixed and matched between the party. All the food tasted wonderful and was well presented. You start with sandwiches, which can be refilled, and were all equally tasty. Then you are presented with your cake tiers, the scones were light and moist and served with generous helpings of clotted cream and jam, the mini Victoria sponges and other mini cakes/tarts were all well flavoured and delicious. For children they bring a separate plate of cakes more suited to their taste, they went down very well. You can also change teas as often as you wanted. A lovely touch to finish of the afternoon was their take away boxes which you can fill with any leftovers. We finished of our outing with a walk through the beautiful grounds. Will definitely come again and would highly recommend it.", "date_of_review": "3 April 2017"}

The initial sandwiches were well presented but not as exceptional as Hanbury Manor in Herts. However, they surpassed themselves with the second part of the tea, with a wonderful selection of cakes and well made scones. The tea selection was also very interesting and varied. I had their White tea which was very nice.  The only disappointment concerns the initial entrance. The hotel entrance/lobby area is grand - centuries old decor but it feels rather soul-less and the grand fire should be roaring with logs rather than being used to house some large candles. The tea rooms are a collection of different rooms and we were placed in the Cocktail Bar where the view onto the pretty gardens was very limited - so at this point, we could have been in a Holiday Inn rather than in a grand and historic venue! I feel that the management should address this area - to again draw comparison, at Hanbury Manor, the teas are served in a very large grand room and this does feel very special compared to Great Fosters.

We chose Sowa based on fact that most likely they are connected with Sowa brand which we know from Poland and we can highly recommend it. They are associated with them but what a disappointment. We've ordered two different plates: pork knuckle and pork cutlet. Cutlet was fine in size but no seasoning at all. Knuckle was a good size but 80% was bone, 5% fat and just a bit of meat. Same - no seasoning at all. Knowing precisely what is roasted pork knuckle we were really disappointed. After we finished our plates, waitress didn't even bother to ask us if we want any dessert (especially they have door connecting them with patisserie next door!). After 20 minutes of endless waiting I've just ask for the bill. Another surprise came when paying for food. When we came I've asked if we can pay by any card and it was confirmed that yes. Surprisingly when it get to payment, I've been told that cards yes but not Amex and ideally not credit cards. A bit of a bummer as Amex becoming more and more popular. We left with a really sour taste in our minds. Considering that I'm polish and my wife is Mexican so we normally talk in English or Spanish, I got to say, that previous review - which apparently has been marked by owner as racist comment - its truth. Tables where are only polish people were attended differently.  To summarise: you better off to any other polish restaurant which is run by local guy, who's actually cares about his business.

We all arrived separately and two of us failed to get in without help. There is a high step and a massive front door, which two of us tried to open but couldn't because the actual door you walk through is the centre bit only! Luckily we were both rescued by the doorman, who successfully hid his smile at our stupidity.  My youngest sister was then escorted to a table, where two ladies were already seated, who she had never seen in her life before. Coincidentally two groups of three were booked in for afternoon tea that day. We all thought it was hilarious. This is the best afternoon tea I have been to since going to the Ritz for my Mum's 70th. You are given a menu, with five options for the afternoon tea, we all went for the normal one, as we were all driving, which was \u00a328. There are also tea and coffee choices and you can have any combination of you want to. We chose 'normal' tea and stuck to it throughout. It is replenished as often as you like. Sandwiches were then brought out, one of each type and I think there were about five of them. The waitress then came round with more. After sandwiches came the cakes - two scones each a small Victoria sponge between us and loads of other cakes. We failed and ended up taking a lot home in the boxes provided for this. The waiters and waitresses were lovely, there when you needed them and unobtrusive when you didn't.  We didn't feel in the slightest bit rushed. They allow two hours for the tea but as ours was probably one of the last slots, we weren't having to vacate for the next party. Service charge of 10% is added to the bill, which the staff we dealt with definitely deserved. The room has a lovely relaxed feel, with comfortable armchairs and sofas. I can't wait to go again!", "date_of_review": "15 December 2016"}

The mouth-watering sandwiches, thoughtfully described by the charming waitress, were delicious and we could not help but give in to temptation when offered a few more. We soon regretted that decision though when the selection of cakes was served - on a pretty 3-tier cake stand. Two types of scones with jam and clotted cream, a victoria cream sponge cake, just big enough for 2 and a top tier of luscious individual cakes. We barely made a dent in them and were delighted to be able to take away in a pretty box to enjoy later. All of that was accompanied by copious amounts of tea served from a silver teapot.

My only negative feedback is that if 2 people are having the same choice of tea then each should be given their own teapot. Different people drink at different rates and prefer different strengths (I asked for extra water to dilute mine with), all the pots look the same so keeping tabs on your own is easier this way, and in our situation the table was large and those \"sharing\" were at opposite ends of the table.

We were shown into The Tudor Room which was laid out beautifully and made the whole occasion feel special. The finger sandwiches were delicious and plentiful, with some unusual breads, and when we had finished them we were offered more. There was a wide choice of teas which were served in elegant silver teapots and also the option to choose coffee or hot chocolate - a nice touch I thought. Then came the cake stand - Wow! The warm scones with jam and clotted cream were as light as a feather and absolutely delicious - there was a fresh cream Victoria sponge to share between two and the patisserie on the third layer was a work of art. The cakes tasted as good as they looked - millionaire's shortbread - blackcurrant macaroon made with fresh blackberries and fresh fruit tartlet to name but a few. There was so much to choose from that we couldn't manage to eat everything- but Great Fosters has that covered and boxes up what you can't manage (in a box to match the china- again a nice touch) so that you can finish it later (much later) when you might have some space! Some of us chose the Pimms afternoon tea and this seemed to compliment the food well. The drink was beautifully presented - full of fruit and flavour. The service we had was excellent with friendly but very professional staff and all in all it is difficult to see how Great Fosters could improve on this experience.

Great Fosters managed to make the experience beautiful and lovely without being at all pretentious - a hard tightrope to walk in my opinion.

The price is affordable and you never feel like you've over paid for your meal, also every time we leave the restaurant, we always leave with additional cakes as they are to die for. And a quick note about staff, if you are not Polish and it's your first visit they will take there time and go through the menu with you but English menu is also available, nothing is to much for the staff and they make you feel very welcome.

The staff were all very welcoming and we had a lovely table by the window. If the weather permits, the Terrace is a perfect location, overlooking the beautiful gardens. It made a pleasant change to be served the sandwiches in instalments, rather than just piled on a plate, and the choice was a bit different to the usual fare - especially the vegetarian option. The pastries looked amazing, but luckily we were given a gorgeous little cardboardd box to take the leftovers home in as we couldn't manage them all. However the piece de resistance were the scones. We both agreed that they were the best we had ever had and between us we have sampled a fair few afternoon teas! Afterwards it was lovely to be able to take a stroll round the beautifully manicured gardens and work off a few of the calories that we had just consumed. There was ample parking and I would definitely go here again. In fact I'm trying to think of an excuse for a return visit.", "date_of_review": "24 August 2016"}

All 3 were in different rooms. This one was outside and the weather was perfect. The table was set beautifully and included a wrap blanket that was needed as the sun lowered behind the hotel. The sandwiches and pastries were as good as usual. The variety of pastries was very much appreciated and they were different than my other visits. The tea itself has lots of flavor which I find superior to the tea served at Fortnum and Mason in London. Why I haven't given my favorite place to dine and have Afternoon Tea in Egham is due to the less then excellent service. Two errors were not bringing all (3) the pots of tea requested at the same time and forgetting to bring one guest her requested Vegetarian sandwiches. We had to wait too long for those corrections. I was very disappointed by the shortcomings in the service this day! It seemed less than satisfactory compared to previous visits.

However, for a birthday treat, we had booked a table for Sunday which was quite a sunny day. I asked for an table umbrella but were told this wasn't possible. So we ended up sitting in hot sun with two small children which wasn't great. As we had two kids who don't like afternoon tea, we wanted to order one for them to share. Again were told this wasn't possible and had to order two lots for them which meant most of it went back as they didn't eat it. A bit of a waste of money I thought.

We worked with the owners to define a two-starter, four-main-course menu. The collaboration was excellent, and they even designed, customised, and word-processed the menu for us to send out ahead of time. We, in turn, provided them with a schedule of who was having what, and the staff made nice name cards, which every guest put on the table in front of them - and everybody got the right dish placed in front of them at the right time. Throughout the evening, the staff were really friendly and accommodating, and nothing was too much trouble. Regarding the food, despite the 'mass catering' element, we were amazed that their usual quality (several of our party eat there quite regularly) was not in any way compromised. I had the Steak Tartare as a starter and found good quality beef, with just the right quantity and quality of condiments. Mixed well, it was the best Tartare my wife had eaten in many a year, she said. My main was Pork Tenderloin with Chanterelle sauce, internationalising a Polish classic. The other starter, Spinach and Feta Dumplings, was well received. The alternate mains, Duck Breast, Boar Meat Pierogi, and the vegetarian option of Potato Pancakes (another classic Polish dish) with Forest Mushrooms, were all acclaimed, with the latter, perhaps, evoking the greatest superlatives. The dessert was one of Sowa's legendary gateaux. Sowa, well known across Poland, originally made their name with these creative and opulent cakes. At their suggestion, they decorated and personalised the cake for the occasion with ingenuity. With regard to wines, we took the house Prosecco as a welcome glass, and then the house white and red wines throughout the meal, which were all quite acceptable. For the toasts, we brought our own Champagne, on which we were charged a pretty standard London level of corkage. All in all, a very successful evening was, in no small measure, achieved through the cooperation, willingness and heart, of this excellent establishment. Our party was slow to wrap up and leave, but at no stage were we made to feel that we had outstayed our welcome. We will undoubtedly repay the compliment through repeat visits in the near future.", "date_of_review": "27 May 2016"}

Having recently moved to Surrey i wasnt too familiar with many other afternoon tea places. The reviews here were enough to prompt me to book it and I am so glad that i did as it was such a stunning location and the afternoon tea was amazing! I really cannot fault it. The staff and waiters were so friendly and very attentive. Everything was fresh my scone literally fell apart and was still warm and tasted like it had just come from the oven! Sandwhich selection was amazing and very generous as was the cakes. We ordered addiontal cappacinos aswel as the tea and these were included within the price which was amazing. I would defintely reccomend this to anyone. Our table was situated by a gorgeous pond with a bridge and fountain behind us and on the other side of us there were amazing gardens and a beautiful maze. I shall be returning to this place without a doubt and look forward to trying the lunch/dinner and breakfast menus. Thanks for a lovely afternoon!!!", "date_of_review": "26 July 2016"}

The wait is over. The Polish classics, beautifully presented and cooked exactly like they should be. Schabowy schnitzel arranged artistically next to a small side of bigos and a swirl of beetroot sauce, steak tartare spiced just exactly right and served in a center of a huge plate with lots of chopped pickles to make it just right, flavoursome, tangy \u017curek soup and of course pierogi... You can watch them made just as you would pizza - and I wish I asked the name of the lovely lady making them who was the discreet centerpiece of the room. The service is pleasant and fast. The prices are your typical London fare but it's worth it. I hope they will get more of Polish craft beers on the menu and a more varied section of drinks because it's guaranteed my British husband and me will be coming back and bringing friends around!", "date_of_review": "21 January 2016"}

There was only 2 chairs at the table and although another chair was put at the table it was at a slight hill towards the lake! Shame the table wasn't ready for our arrival particularly as they had extra 25 mins because we were late. However, I did feel safe, and the staff did ensure I didn't mind. We were directly in the sun as the parasol didn't reach our table which was a shame as it was very bright and hot. Maybe parasol should be over entire table in the summer??? The tea was very nice with a good selection of sandwiches. the cakes delightful and scones lovely and warm. We did have to ask to refill cream/jam as only very small amount in bowl. We asked for extra pot of tea too and all the staff were very accommodating, polite and friendly. We had a walk around the beautiful grounds.

We then had a three tier platter of totally different mini cakes, plus a midi size victoria sponge, plus a plate of 6 scones with cream and jam!  We carefully split all of them into 3 so we could each taste all of them in their wonder. They were just as delicious as they were beautiful. All of this was accompanied with our choice of tea and water. Just when we felt we were about to pop we were presented with 'goody boxes' to take home what we couldn't finish! We opted to sit outside because we were blessed with glorious weather, however had it turned a little nippy every seat was prepared with a blanket should you need it.

Very poor value for money. Quality of the food was average, and in one or two areas, tasteless. The service was rushed and inefficient, being seated at a very wobbly table was an experience we've never encountered before in a 4 star establishment, especially as a waiter had to place a considerable amount of cardboard under the table to stabilise it. This was after the drinks had been spilled...... The table position on the undulating floor was not appropriate and should have been dealt with prior to guests being seated. The staff, although pleasant, seemed more focused on maintaining their time schedule than the needs of the paying guest. The bill had to be presented three times before it was correct, and finally the \"doggy bag\" was so small that when opened back at home everything was crushed and mashed together. I feel this is a generous mark at \"poor\" and is only saved by the wonderful and extensive gardens. We have had afternoon tea at many, many quality establishments and this was by some way the worst.

Oh my goodness, the Pimm\u2019s cocktail not only tasted wonderful, but the presentation in the glass was stunning. English Breakfast tea and Earl Grey was selected (not the most expansive list of teas we might see elsewhere, but nonetheless delicious) and then came the sandwiches. This must have been the softest bread we have tasted and the fillings were scrumptious (our personal favourites being the smoked salmon and cream cheese on beetroot bread, and roast beef, caramelised onion and rocket on kibbled onion bread. Yum.) They also offered us more after we have finished, which we always like. Sometimes people forget about the sandwich portion of an afternoon tea and it\u2019s definitely not something you want to cast aside. The scones were lovely and warm, with plenty of jam and clotted cream. Very tasty too! There was also a mini Victoria sponge which was indeed very spongy, as well as an array of cakes!

We wanted just to spend some Sunday afternoon time for coffee.To place an order took more than 10 min, after another 30min waiting for coffee and cake we just simply left the restaurant. We have also asked to speak to the manager but apparently on busy Sunday afternoon there was none from management there. They should be more organised especially if they know that weekends are extremely busy. Half of the menu was not available and poor waitress was not aware of that. Basically is very chaotic and disorganised, staff seems lost!!!! They all need good manager and supervisor who will put all the place in order. Trainings!!! Have you people ever heard about It !!!!!

There is also a glass booth where you can see the pierogi (dumplings/ravioli) being made from scratch (and I know how difficult and time consuming that is from personal experience). We had pierogi filled with potato and cheese, dressed with caramelised onions and a white sauce on the side, plus traditional Polish seasonal salad. We ordered our desert from the massive choice of cakes in the patisserie. For anyone who does not know about Polish cakes, while different, they are at least the equal of French patisseries, they really are that good. You don't need to be Polish to enjoy the food on offer. Whilst traditional, there is plenty of good, hearty meat and two veg dishes on offer for the discerning English palette.

About 10 mains, including geese, duck, chicken beef, pork, all beautifully presented. There are also three salads and a few extra sides.

While paying the bill our waiter asked if we want to give him a tip. What kind of behaviour is it? it was embarrassing.  However chefs saved this restaurant from total defeat by the delicious food.

Food is always excellent quality and I adore the sandwiches- it is great that they come round and offer you more. The only small complaint I have is that, although the pastries are delicious and dainty you have to cut them in half and share them- you don't get to have one of them each, but perhaps I'm just being greedy, as I still almost always come away with a goody bag because I can't eat it all!

The portions were a good size, and I have leftovers which I can't wait to tuck into.  I would definitely return, I just hope the fruit fly situation can be sorted out.

We unfortunately had a dirty sugar spoon and cup on our table that we highlighted to the waitress who was mortified and couldn't appologise enough, after that things went well, plenty of sandwiches were offered to us and far too many cakes for us to eat in one sitting, thankfully they have thought of this and are ready with the cake boxes as just about everyone took some cakes home. Only thing I would have liked would have been an offerring of more tea at an earlier time as by the time the waitress could get back to us as they were busy the need had passed.

There was limited choice and the food was not great - lots of heavy dumplings. I came passed here a few weeks ago and looked at the extensive menu which includes dishes to suit almost everyone plus a few vegetarian choices. I persuaded my wife to give it a go so we came for lunch on Saturday. They were almost full but found us a table. Service was prompt and we were soon eating a fabulous wild mushroom soup. The soup was served from a jug and poured over a very decorative arrangement of cooked wild mushrooms. On the outside rim of the soup plate were delicate dollops of garlic mushroom puree. The flavour was fantastic. For main course my wife went for beef cheeks in a sour cherry sauce and I went for beef loin cooked medium rare. Both these dishes were beautifully presented and you could tell the ingredients were fresh and great quality. The dishes were both made up of loads of different elements and were complex. The beef cheeks were served with delicate and light dumplings and my beef with tasty waxy roast potatoes plus lots of vegetables. Also the portions were substantial. For dessert we shared apple pie served 3 ways with ice cream - all were lovely and had a perfect balance of sweet and sour. The coffee was good as well and including sparkling water and a beer the bill came to just over \u00a330 a head which s reasonable for the quality. Service was delightful. The waitress was very pleasant and served us in a formal manner. I was hugely impressed by this restaurant which is truly a fine dining experience and probably the best quality in Ealing. If I had to make one criticism I would have liked to see a better choice of wine by the glass and I think the food deserves a few more interesting wines by the bottle too.", "date_of_review": "4 December 2016"}

They answer questions about food without rushing you and are enthusiastic about sharing their homeland's cuisine - all fabulous reasons to eat here.  We started with Mushroom Dumpling Soup (see pic) which my father loved, an assortment of Pierogi (dumplings) - Boar Meat (see pic), Mushroom & Sauerkraut (see pic), Crispy Buckwheat (see pic) all were delicious and everyone at the table fought over who was going to eat the last one on each plate. Mains were Veal Wellington (see pic) which was so amazing and highly recommended, Beef Cheeks with Potato Dumplings (see pic) - yummy plus. Desserts were Hot Chocolate (see pic) which is really rich chocolatey and perfect on a cold or wet night, Apple Strudel with Ice Cream (see pic) which was clearly delicious as the person eating it almost finished in a matter of minutes!

Despite the Polish theme, the weather was decidedly English and we unfortunately chose not to eat at the festival. This meant, having been taunted with the sights and smells of Polish cuisine we were yearning to enjoy some.  Thankfully, we found Sowa. The design is ingenious as it's two businesses in one: A cafe and cake shop to the left hand premises and a restaurant in the right hand premises and the two are adjoined.  We were seated in a quiet corner, thankfully away from families and children.  What a wonderful surprise when our waitress happened to be a former member of staff at a sandwich shop near my work in Westminster! This was a funny twist but the fact I knew our waitress had an unexpected and positive impact on our dining experience.  My wife chose rabbit and I had my favourite Polish dish, golonka. I don't know what I was expecting, but I was fairly astonished at the fine dining appearance of my wife's rabbit dish - absolutely superb. I may have had my favourite dish, which was also very good but perhaps I was secretly jealous of my wife's dinner! She says that she remembers it to this day which reflects the standard of the dish.  We only had a main course so can't comment on the rest of the menu, but if it's anything like that rabbit dish, then the standard is high.  Another quirky twist about Sowa is that there's a babcia (Polish for grandmother) making pierogi (Polish dumplings) in a little kitchen area almost inside the restaurant. This is very showy and demonstrates how Sowa's pierogi are made on-site, by hand and not bought in. Impressive. You can probably tell, we highly recommend to others and are highly likely to return when next in Ealing.", "date_of_review": "13 January 2018"}

It was absolutely lovely. We had the pleasure of being assisted by Camello and Eric -- 2 positively charming young men from Columbia. They were quite attentive to our needs, making sure we wanted for nothing. So, for them alone, I would give a 5 Star rating. However, the experience did not end with them. We sat in a room with an amazing view of the gardens, laden with wisteria. So lovely.  We were very relaxed with a feeling that we had all of the time in the world to enjoy this experience (2 hours is provided, however should you need additional time you are welcome to walk the gardens, or move to another location to complete your tea). As for the actual tea selection -- we were pleased to see that it was a large menu, with many options to choose from -- including standard English teas, but also many exotic and lovely options.  The delicate presentation of the sandwiches was exactly what I imagined the perfect High Tea would have. A major added bonus is the gluten free option. We specifically selected Great Fosters for this reason. My friend was pleasantly surprised at how wonderful all of the GF items tasted. I had the standard tea sandwiches and also found them quite tasty. And then they came around with a tray of sandwiches (both GF and regular) so that we could have more sandwiches! Excellent! We needed to save room for dessert, so we only indulged in a bit more -- but it was really nice that the option was there to have additional. This, as I understand it, is not always the case in other places.  Oh, I mustn't forget my first Pimm's experience. We ordered a Cider and a Pimm's to accompany our Tea. Pimm's is an English drink (somewhat similar to a sangria, but not with wine). Very good. I'm actually going to bring a bottle of Pimm's back home with me so I can recreate this experience! Delish! Lastly, the towers of desserts arrived. They prepared individual towers for us -- my friend had the GF selections. Again, the presentation was delightful. Each tower had scones, Victoria Sponge, and assorted other pastries (that looked like artwork). Not only did they look beautiful, but they tasted amazing!!! By now, we were full (or fat and happy as we would say back home). We strolled for a bit in the garden, where we spotted several geese and goslings, and then made our way out to the front of the hotel. Both Camello and Eric came to wish us farewell -- the excellent hospitality continuing until the very end of our adventure. I have not a single complaint to share, other than I can't go here all of the time. This was my first experience having High Tea. I can't imagine wanting to experience it anywhere else when this met and exceeded my every expectation. I would not only highly recommend the Afternoon Tea at Great Fosters, but I will be sure to come back the very next time I have the pleasure of being in England. So, if you get the chance, go! If you're lucky, Eric and Camello will be there!", "date_of_review": "9 May 2017"}

The variety and home made quality of their cakes was the thing who attracted me first, with their szarlotka (apple pie) being my favourite one. Quality of food is nothing less. Their dishes really taste like excellent homemade traditional dishes: delicious goat cheese salad, home made pierogie (kind of Polish dumplings/ravioli) and their baked kaczka (duck), just to mention my favourite ones. Speaking of home made pierogie, when you go there at evenings you will be able to witness the sweet but strong lady hand making pierogie just in front of customers. You can't really get anything more fresh and home made than that, aside from your own grandmother (maybe...). All of that happening in a restaurant which compared to many other places around is very elegant, very nicely decorated but sober and warm at the same time. As a last thing, but not the least, their staff is the perfect balance of professionalism, manners and fun.

We were given a warm welcome by the staff and had a lovely walk around the grounds. Then I am afraid it was downhill all the way. I want to be constructively critical as just a few things could have made this a 5 star occasion which unfortunately it wasn't. We and another couple were seated in the same room as a large group of people (more than a dozen with children in tow) so all intimacy was lost - couldn't they (or us and the other couple) have been put in a separate area ? (I noticed a couple arriving after us were led to a room leading off ours). My main issue was that apart from sandwiches everything else is just one big sugar fix. It would have been great if they had offered something savoury, pastries, mini quiches, vol au vents etc. in place of all of the rich cream and sweetness. There was nothing wrong with the cakes themselves just too much emphasis on sweet things and insufficient imagination given to those with savoury tastes. I was not alone in wishing for something savoury as I heard someone from the big crowd saying he would have likes some cheese. I only ate about half of the sweet things on offer but started to feel really physically sick. I didn't say anything to my partner but when he got in the car he said he felt sick as well. Also it would have been nice if the staff had asked if we wanted fresh tea - basically one large pot each was plonked down in front of us at the start and expected to last 2 hours. As I was feeling nauseated it would have been wonderful to have had the option of some peppermint tea - yes I know I could have asked but service is about anticipating needs. So sadly we doubt we will be returning and won't be buying an afternoon tea voucher for anyone. They packed up all of the remaining cakes beautifully for us to take home but as they were the last thing we wanted, we gave them to person who had bought the voucher who was disappointed too that we hadn't enjoyed ourselves.

This place was highly recommended by a work colleague. On booking was asked if it was for a social occasion, which was nice(1) As it was a warm day so we arrived an hour early to have a wonder around the gardens, we were given a map on arrival and it took around 30 minutes, they were very enjoyable and well kept, though partly fenced off due to a wedding taking place (2) We were seated 15 mins early, very helpful as we were early and had a nice table by the moat. Order taken after 10 mins of waiting, then another 15 mins till sandwiches and tea arrived. That's ok as we were chatting.  Our daughter ordered the vegetarian sandwiches that failed to arrive, but we didn't notice as it all arrived on one plate, it was the vegetarian option being delivered separately to another table that made us realise, we mentioned it and it was soon sorted with a refill for the rest of us. Good sandwiches, very nice. Then the cakes arrived, awesome!! Although when asking if we could have another chocolate one we were told no, which is a shame as only one of each cake is supplied for two people. Disappointed daughter. Good choice of tea and the wife enjoyed her champagne, it's easy to complain on the small things but menu said hot chocolate with marshmallows, so moans of disappointment from my son when it turned up without any, we could see the staff were under pressure so just let it go, in the grand scale of things it's not life changing. So why a 4 and not a 5 marks (1) after making me think we were going to treated special, it was business as usual, I've had a message piped on a plate before and was half expecting something to make my wife remember the event, especially as I was asked. (2) The wedding, I'm guessing staff were diverted to the service of that and not us, other tables complained of waiting unreasonable times and if we were not so relaxed we may have done the same. The waiters were definitely under pressure and although they did try they were not very attentive. Having to pay a 12% tip for that level of service is not good, service charge should be based on level of service and not automatic, but that's not for here. Conclusion Food was exceptional but small portions for the price, \u00a347 for a glass of champagne 2 rounds of sandwiches and a few cakes is not great value with the level of service we received, I'd be happy to pay that if I was made to feel special, but I wasn't. The grounds were enjoyable, we may go back but would make sure a function was not taking place at the same time. There is a lot of competition in this area for our custom and when paying Premium prices we should get premium service.", "date_of_review": "10 June 2017"}

You only get a two hour booking slot for your afternoon tea, which on our last visit at Christmas we found to be just about right, but unfortunately due to traffic, some of our party were a little late getting there. We all understood that the time constraints were still the same and were happy to hurry up a little bit, but unfortunately I think every other table in the room had the same issue. What this caused was for the service to end up being slower than normal as the staff rushed around trying to keep everything timely, and actually having the opposite effect. We didn't get our cake stands until 15 minutes before we were due to leave, despite being ready to receive them quite a bit earlier. We asked for the bill at the exact point that our booking was due to end. Our poor waitress appeared to have the manager from hell (blonde gentleman) trying to get her to hurry things along and she looked like she was nearly in tears as she took our money. I felt absolutely terrible for her, as the situation she was in was absolutely not her fault.  On the bright side, the food was exquisite as usual. The location is just absolutely beautiful to sit and have a luxury afternoon tea and the grounds are well worth a stroll around afterwards. Everyone was happy with both vegetarian and the meat options, and we all got either a glass of Pimms or champers to go with the tea which really added to the whole experience. I would definitely come back again and recommend this venue for afternoon tea, but all parties should check traffic and allow a decent amount of time to arrive as your booking slot is not flexible!", "date_of_review": "12 June 2017"}

We eventually got there about 20minutes late and we were warmly greeted by the staff and taken to the Tudor room. We were introduced to Carmelo our waiter for the afternoon tea experience. He was an absolute gem and I even got to practice my Spanish! He had wonderful manners and had good conversation. We had jasmine tea and oolong tea \u2615\ufe0f with our sandwiches and we were offered more -it was delightful. I then had a hot chocolate with marshmallows followed by a tier of cakes. We delved into scones which were lovely and fluffy served with clotted cream and a nice jam. We had the English breakfast tea. We felt like the cakes needed more of a variety with more flavour and colour. The other thing I noticed was the cakes were one of each. I really liked the chocolate tart but I had to share it! Other afternoon teas I have been to have given two of each cakes. Presentation of the cakes were pretty. Even though the lady said we would lose our time at the table we actually didn't feel rushed and had the full 2 hours so it worked out fine in the end. The ambiance of the room was nice and intimate so it was good for a special occasion and as a nice touch they gave a wonderful dish with a cake saying happy birthday. My mother throughly enjoyed that.  After our teas Carmelo packed our cakes up as we couldn't finish them all in one go and placed them somewhere safe while we went for a long walk in grounds. There was a wedding going on and the weather was fantastic. I recommend visiting the English gardens, the rose garden was splendid and the discovering the secret gardens,bee hives and lake.  All in all a great experience and I would visit there again in the future. ", "date_of_review": "15 June 2017"}

We ordered from a wide selection of teas (coffee and soft drinks were also offered) and then a huge array of sandwiches arrived, followed by an incredibly beautiful variety of delicious cakes and hot scones, and many refills of tea.

We arrived and we were welcomed by a rather nice waitress (she was nice until she realised that my partner was English). Sat down and ordered our drinks. My partners coke was fine, but my white wine was warm. We then started looking around the place and realised that they get 'brownie points' for the decor and the fact that the place was amazingly clean. My partner was given a menu in English which was a really nice touch. We then ordered our meals. I went for beef roulade and silesian dumplings. My partner ordered the pork knuckle. We had to wait forever for our food to arrive. When it finally came, it looked absolutely amazing but that's were it ended. I will start with the pork knuckle - all the dressing that came with it was fine, but the knuckle itself was pretty much fat and skin and very little meat - not what you would've been served in Poland. My partner never had that meal before and I was really excited for him, but I soon as I saw it I knew it wasn't going to be good. Now, my meal - the most disappointing meal I had in years. Let me make it clear - I am from Silesia - I grew up on that meal. I had it every Sunday for 20 years of my life. I cooked it myself hundreds of times. My gran eats it every Sunday for the last 80 years. I cook it at least once a month. I think I know what I'm talking about. What I got on my plate was some sort of a mistake. I had the silesian dumplings which were fried! Silesian dumplings fried? Serioulsy? Why on earth would you do that? They also tasted like they had an egg and plain flour in them. They are supposed be potatoes and potato's flour and boiled. That's it. They most definitely are not supposed be fried and covered in basil pesto (basil pesto in Silesia? Where?). You have destroyed the most iconic meal in Silesia. The roulade - that was not a traditional roulade. It was nice, but it was not the one you eat in Silesia. It was some weird piece of beef stuffed with more weirdness. I can't even describe it. Traditionally you eat this meal with red cabbage. I can forgive swapping the cabbage for beetroot, but where that sweetness came from? This is not supposed be sweet! Also, did your chef forgot what salt and pepper are? The food was hugely under seasoned and at times tasted of nothing. For someone that never tried Polish food, especially Silesian food it could be an ok meal, but for someone who knows it well it was a disaster. Please, avoid this place. Everything there is for show, but there is no taste in it all. Go to a small, scruffy looking cafe and it will blow you taste buds away. The food at Sowa restaurant is not worth the money or your time.", "date_of_review": "26 August 2018"}

The floral display in the beer garden must have won prizes, it's unbelievable. The personal service, with two cooks bringing out the food and chatting, put the dining experience right up there to start with. The Ploughman's had a well-thought-out simplicity with a killer Stilton. The fish and chips starred a perfectly cooked piece of haddock in the lightest batter. Judging by what we had, I think the pub is trying to deliver absolutely top quality pub food in a compact way. I would imagine they have an incredible turnover in the summer, and also as the go to pub next to the crematorium. They had Timothy Taylor beer, which was great, but CAMRA would probably poopoo the pub because of the lack of real ales. Don't let this put you off though, Landlord is a fine pint, also the best bitter as a sessioner. If you are a gardener, you must check out the display. The fact that the fabulous Duck's Hill Garden Centre is half a mile away can hardly be a coincidence.", "date_of_review": "9 July 2018"}

Booked a table outside to be told we were being seated inside due to the wasps, the staff kindly agreed to set us a table in the garden. Menu was explained in good detail with our orders taken promptly, the staff deciding to place the jam in a different container to prevent the wasps. The drinks arrived in a timely manner followed by the afternoon tea, the jam was served in its usual fashion which did attract a lot of wasps resulting in the jam needing to be replaced. We decided not to order any alcohol but the glasses were not taken away. The food quality was very good with decent size sandwiches, but no offer of any additional items. Waited 30 mins for a waiter to top our drinks up but no one appeared - I had to go inside myself to ask for more drinks. Some of the staff were delightful, others couldn\u2019t care a less and it was weird we were served by so many different staff- there was no consistency which is possibly why we were forgotten about. It\u2019s very unlike me not to leave tips, but unfortunately the staff did not deserve anything - considering the standard of Great Fosters this was some what disappointing.

My sister booked dairy free for hers but they claimed to know nothing about it when we got there. Rather than sorting it out efficiently, they made a big fuss about it and said they couldn't do any sandwiches so she needed to order off the main sandwich menu! This whole thing took a lot of time so we were left with our afternoon tea for a good 30 mins while they sorted hers out. It made the whole thing really awkward for my sister who didn't want to make a fuss. I spoke to the manager who just kept repeating that they hadnt received the request for dairy free and so it wasnt their fault. Eventually he agreed to give my sister her afternoon tea free but then charged her for a sandwich! Apart from that, we waited ages to be offered any drinks and the service was overall very poor.

Knowing that we were staying in the hotel I was told that should I not wish to eat everything that a box could be provided and the cakes taken to my room.  Overall the cakes, scones and sandwiches were nice (I\u2019d go with other reviews and say that a different bread is needed for the coronation chicken and whilst the cucumber swirl looks fancy it looks better than it tastes.)

Mediocre Tea, Truly Great Service", "comment": "Like other Afternoon Tea reviewers here, we have a long and familiar history with GF.  Been coming here since I was a child. Indeed, it\u2019s somewhere we\u2019ve recommended to many and have often, over the years, taken transatlantic family and friends to visit, prior to the new ownership. Due to health problems, we haven\u2019t visited GF for at least a year, and we were excited to see the changes that we\u2019d read about. Whilst there\u2019s absolutely no doubt money has been spent on renovations, whichever interior decorator Alexander Hotels appointed had no business taking on this brief, unless said hotel group specifically requested anodyne as the look they sought to achieve.  Indeed the revamp appears entirely designed to rip out the hotel\u2019s heart and soul, and, instead instal a bland 4/5 star modern, sub Gulf, private hospital look.  Perhaps this works for the corporate, and the undoubtably lucrative local, nouveau riche, wedding market, but it does nothing for one of Henry VIII\u2019s former hunting lodges, and a sense of occasion. The building must be colossally expensive to run, so perhaps who am I to criticise? Now to the Afternoon Tea..... We were served by the utterly charming, and faultlessly professional, Caspar, (who was assisted by lovely Eunice with tea replenishments).  He\u2019s been at the hotel for the past 3 years and knows the hotel, and it\u2019s guests, inside out. Nothing was too much trouble, and Caspar offered us clean plates and refills of tea, milk, cream without being asked. He single handedly made our afternoon, and stopped us feeling ripped off. What was poor, mean and unforgivable at \u00a335 per head, (plus very deserved service charge), was the penny pinching of the actual afternoon tea, however.  Our tea stand comprised of 4 uninspired sandwiches, 2 warm scones, a small selection of very sweet, little cakes and a macaron. Never at any point we\u2019re we offered a refill of anything on the cake stand! Hmm I\u2019m certainly not the first person to mention this here on TripAdvisor during this past year. Whilst tea itself was perfectly decent, it didn\u2019t represent good value in any way whatsoever. Price wise, GF compares very favourably to other local offerings, but contents wise, it most certainly doesn\u2019t. It will be interesting in these steeply competitive times, to see how busy Afternoon Tea at Great Fosters continues to be.", "date_of_review": "6 October 2019"}

Returning for the 1st time in 3years it has changed quite a bit. still stunning. beautiful grounds.  unfortunatly the afternoon tea was rather dissapointing. I am dairy free and they offer a dairy free afternoon tea. it comprised of 2 salmon and caper finger sandwiches...very dry. unfortunatly it got worse. my only other sandwich on offer was 4 thinly sliced pieces of cucumber in white bread. nothing else. not even a slither of any type of spread. that was my offering. I'm dairy free, not vegetarian yet had no chicken offerings at all.  none of us were offered more sandwiches so my 2 sandwiches were my lot. the dairy free scones.hard and very cloggy. nice to have dairy free cream though and jam was lovely.  maybe my biggest disappointment was what most people look forward to the most. the cakes and deserts.  I could have cried. a tiny plain dry cake, some type of lemon jelly which was awful, a raspberry panacota type desert and a chocolate offering. truly terrible to be honest.  if that is the best they can offer dairy free guests I think they need to 're evaluate their thinking.  we were not offered top ups of water either. very sweetly we were presented with a happy anniversary plate written in chocolate with 2 macaroons for our anniversary. a lovely touch but unable to eat them due to my dairy free intolerance.  a big shame. I honestly think they can do better. especially now allergies and intolerances are common and there are many ingredients readily available to create wonderful things. maybe we will return for our 10 year anniversary and try again.", "date_of_review": "9 October 2019"}

It\u2019s always fantastic and has never disappointed my friends or family that I have taken there...until today. The menu has completely changed and you can tell they\u2019ve made a lot of cutbacks, yet charge the same amount of money. Normally we would greedily stuff ourselves with their delicious beef sandwiches on onion bread, or smoked salmon and cream cheese. This time, we didn\u2019t even want to finish the sandwiches in front of us, let alone ask for more. The smoked salmon and capers were revolting, the rest of the sandwiches were pretty tasteless. They used to give a lovely Victoria sponge or lemon drizzle cake, in addition to the delicious smaller cakes. They seem to have stopped that now. The smaller cakes weren\u2019t very nice, we would normally take them home if we hadn\u2019t finished but they were that bad that we didn\u2019t.  The service wasn\u2019t brilliant, whereas before the staff were very attentive. I used to always tell everyone how fantastic the afternoon tea was. It was always the best one I\u2019d ever been to. Today, it was a very standard afternoon tea but for the price of a very good one. It is far from worth the money that that charge now. I\u2019m not sure why they have made these changes, whoever has made them needs to change them back. Don\u2019t try and fix things that aren\u2019t broken!

I love it when someone is so sure of what they are doing and they are not only right but they nail it. Everything that was served to all us was perfect. Tartar sauce, clearly made on site was lovely. Peas were good quality and freshly cooked. They clearly had not been sitting in luke warm water like in some places. The chips were lovely. Skin left on, not greasy and they complimented the fish.  Now to the star of the show the fish. Great tasting, thin batter and again not greasy. Many pubs could learn from this one and when we are next in the area we will of course try something else.", "date_of_review": "17 July 2019"}

It was one of the best around with superb sandwiches, a good range of teas, super scones and and delicious cakes. Add a wide tea menu and a few more sandwiches if you would like them, and it was worth traveling around the M25 for.  I did. Repeatedly. I knew GF had new owners and that the price of the tea had risen considerably, there was also a maximum time at table policy which I did not recall from previous visits. Still, based upon past teas I was looking forward to returning. GF is still a beautiful building in immaculate grounds and inside there had been some half hearted refurbishment with corporate chairs and new but somehow not quite right crockery.  The tea menu had been cut back with a reduced choice, no more Lapsang. But if the tea menu had been trimmed the food offering had been slashed. No more trays of sandwiches and plates of scones and cakes. A single stand per couple with a few, trying to be artful, but fundamentally low rent sandwiches, a couple of scones and mini cakes and macaron. The scones had also been on a diet but were warm and tasty and came with appropriately reduced portions of cream and jam. The cakes varied from quite good to sugar rush. Service was very friendly even after we declined the various upsells. On a sunny summers day the grounds might make the tea a worthwhile admission price but otherwise afternoon tea at GF is barely worth crossing the road for, let alone a few junctions worth of the M25", "date_of_review": "10 October 2019"}

Taking away the over the top floral displays has really opened up the room. The afternoon tea - I have a number of complaints, which I did not want to address at the time (more later) We were seated at 1pm - we assume we were meant to sit in the 5 seats as there was no one there to show us. I had been offered to go through when I arrived as just me, but wanted for all 5 of us to go through together. Despite this, we didn't get our tea until 1.35. As in the beverages, not the sandwiches. I realise that you had a number of other afternoon teas on but they were served a lot quicker than us. (Were they guests of the hotel and therefore more valuable to you?) Agreed, one of my party made it tricky on the day by asking to be gluten free (in addition to myself) which no doubt caused panic in the kitchen.  When the teas arrived, I was given a tea holder (I don't know if there is a correct name for them) and it was pointed out \"sandwiches - gluten free\", \"scones - gluten free\" \"macaron - gluten free etc\". It felt really over the top and I did not rate the service of the girl who served them - Veronika perhaps? She had very very black mascara on. The teas arrived on individual tea holders. I have experienced this numerous times due to being gluten intolerant but it was actually very awkward on the table. Particularly due to the level at which they sat = eye level in your new lower down chairs. It meant conversation and celebration was around the edges of the tea and not flowing. Needless to say, I was further disappointed to only receive 3 finger sandwiches each. And no offers of replenishment. This has never happened to me before, even in the big London hotels (Soho, Dorchester Athenaeum). Funnily enough, the member of staff who was in the room then, managed to continually avoid our eye contact so never mind, a pregnant lady had just three sandwiches. It felt very mean. Previously, the service has been impeccable and we have been offered refills or more tea and water throughout - this did not happen, so I was only able to enjoy two cups of tea. The scones were lovely, however your staff presented the afternoon tea cages facing away from my friends so they were unable to see the spoons for the cream and jam. Small things, but when you are paying \u00a337 a head for a non alcoholic afternoon tea with only three finger sandwiches, it counts.  Moving on to the cakes. They were very small,intricate and overly sweet whilst not really tasting of anything. In fact, our pregnant lady didn't touch them despite only having three finger sandwiches.  We were permitted to sit at the table for longer than the allotted two hours, which we were thankful for - but perhaps also because of your delay in bringing out our beverages which would have a knock on effect for the rest of service. It did take us three requests to get the bill though, which was a bit frustrating as there was only one other couple dining at the time.", "date_of_review": "4 March 2020"}

We have a Gluten Free Daughter and a lactose free son and have always been blown away by the food. This time we chose to take our friends during the Eat our Help out scheme and have just returned a little shocked.  Very disappointed that the hotel was exceedingly busy (which is a good thing for them) but the afternoon tea was a long way from previous years. The Sandwiches were very plain, the scones were tiny and the cakes we overall below standard. We were so upset having taken friends and telling them how good it was going to be.  Overall the staff tried really hard and in 32 Degree heat did incredibly well but they were just short staffed. I have to thank them for at least making the effort. Casper took our problems but asked us to write a review again (I have written previously a glowing review). I want to understand that if eat out help out is causing this and intended to improve the number of customers this won't work. When we asked for more sandwiches the staff said she would ask her manager, never to return. The total experience was around 3 1/2 hours long and I don't know why they took so long,  But overall the food quality was not acceptable.  I will struggle to be back next year unless I am fully convinced this was temporary and will be removing my recommendation from Coeliac Berkshire website until this is improved.  lets hope this was a one off but please be careful of previous photos things are not the same.", "date_of_review": "10 August 2020"}

HOWEVER, the afternoon tea has very much gone down hill. They have kept the price of \u00a335-45 per person but cut the portion sizes dramatically. You use to get: sandwiches on multiple types of bread, fresh scones, a Victorian sponge cake and desserts.  You now get basic sandwiches, TINY scones, and miniature desserts.

The greeting from the two ladies serving was so warm and even though they'd never met us before, we felt like returning friends! We then met the landlord who was so charming and he told us that they wanted it to be a community hub sort of pub, so for that reason they serve food during the day but not at night and they don't do a roast at the weekend, that sort of thing.The bar was lovely and clean, fantastic atmosphere with no ranting dukebox throwing out it's music so loudly that guest can't hear themselves talk let alone think!!! They did have screen but it wasn't on, the landlord said that they did have a jukebox in the other bar but this one was kept as the more refined one.

Having not been for a while we decided to go on a quiet Tuesday afternoon and my goodness... Firstly, after we were seated, there was a great deal of confusion over a QR code which we were told to scan. When we were eventually provided one we were told to scan it but put in a different table number - this didn't work. Upon a different waitress arriving at the table to take our order (despite having no menus), she then told us we needn't bother with the QR code. We were then provided with the menus and what a difference compared to visits gone by. Very limited tea options. We proceeded to order - one normal tea, one vegetarian, an English breakfast and a black coffee. We waited a little while and a third, different member of staff attended our table for reasons unknown. He was pleasant and named Casper. We informed him of our veggie order, just in case. He assured us it'll be taken care of... Our food and drink arrived and we were greeted by two normal afternoon teas and our beverages - no veggie options in sight. We flagged down a member of staff and informed them of their faux pas. An apology was received and some veggie sandwiches promptly arrived. Now for the food... I'm not exaggerating when I say that a 7 year old could have knocked up the majority of what was offered albeit slicing cucumber that thinly must require surgical precision. Very bland, very uninspiring. Cucumber and cream cheese, egg mayo, salmon and PLAIN ham. The veggie options were PLAIN chutney, cucumber and cream cheese, coleslaw and egg mayo. I mean, c'mon. It was as mundane as it gets. The scones were microscopic and we asked for additional cream and jam in order to feel as though we got our moneys worth (which I'll come on to). I have no idea how you'd make scones that small. Finally the cakes sort of saved the day. They were easily the best part but in no way compensated for the rest. I suppose we should end on cost. Had it not been for the Eat Out to Help Out initiative, our tea would have cost us \u00a370 before service which is a 12.5% standard. That's \u00a378.75. Let that sink in. Excluding drinks, that's almost \u00a34 per item on the plate. \u00a34 for a chutney filled finger sandwich... In the end, we found the whole thing hilariously bad.

The meats were cooked perfectly and the red cabbage was the surprise of the dish, with its beautiful balsamic taste. The service was both enjoyable, with light hearted banter around the cellar we dined amongst and impeccable in its execution. Was certainly a memorable afternoon and one we will be arranging again.", "date_of_review": "1 November 2020"}

It was an amazing day and sitting in the beautiful gardens was a joy. Service was ok but it would have been nice to have had new cups and saucers with a fresh pot of tea. Sandwiches were so disappointing the brioche with beef which my partner could not eat and wasn\u2019t offered a similar replacement was good. The rest were poor supermarket white and brown bread when the local town has a great baker! Fillings were minuscule. My partner as a vegetarian was given two cheese and tomato sandwiches in white bread as an alternative. Scones were good. Pastries were ok but the lemon cake was dry. Unfortunately we will not be making a return visit.", "date_of_review": "23 September 2020"}

We requested when booking that we\u2019d like the occasion to be extra special and we were not disappointed. We were given our own private room, the staff were all friendly and courteous. The afternoon tea was excellent, with a good selection of cakes and the finger sandwiches were fresh and tasty.  It was a very pleasant afternoon. Beautiful settings to celebrate any occasion.

The food was great BUT Sowa\u2019s attention to keeping diners safe was extremely poor. Issues included  - no hand sanitiser on entering  - no temperature check or self declaration  - waitresses wearing masks under their chin - and worst of all, being seated less than 8 inches from the next table (I know, I should just have turned around and left) There were no screens and certainly no effort to follow social distancing guidance. It\u2019s a real shame given the food is good, Ealing needs decent restaurants and the local pubs are being forced to spend \u00a3000\u2019s on Covid precautions. Now I am home, I am pretty annoyed with myself for not causing a fuss. I\u2019ll decide on Sunday whether to drop local trading standards a complaint since there has to be consistent rules for everyone. And Sowa appear to be breaching most of them. What a shame...", "date_of_review": "12 December 2020"}

Such backward minded people shouldn\u2019t be working in a place like London where it is so multicultural.  I am from a mixed background and love learning about different cultures, food and traditions. It was my sisters birthday and with covid and everything that\u2019s happening I thought it would be nice to get out of the house and try this nearby place. I was excited to try Sowa as it seemed really elegant and inviting.  However, to my dismay it was anything but welcoming. I was cut off mid sentence when making my order to someone who was stood behind me in the queue (was not even a customer as he left the shop after their conversation which lasted a good few minutes). I let it slide trying not to think too much of it. I asked the waitress kindly if she could assist me in letting me know which cakes did not contain alcohol- oh! But it seemed a pain for her, she looked a bit angry and had an expression on her face that said why are you doing here? I started asking myself that very question! But I continued my order and sat down to join my family.  We were the only ones there at first, soon after us it started getting busy. I noticed that everyone had been served (like 4 or 5 tables) but we hadn\u2019t even been given our hot drinks yet. I looked around and instantly got another staff members attention. She asked me if I needed any help, I replied saying that it want help I needed, I just wanted to get served, questioned why it was taking so long when we were the only customers in the restaurant and so many tables have been served despite them arriving after us. The lady apologised and immediately went to go and see what was happening. So i thought great, shouldn\u2019t be long now. How wrong was I! Instead of getting my order sorted she was serving new customers. Filled with disappointment and disgust at the lack of service we requested a refund as nothing had even been prepared for our table, even after making the remark that we had been waiting a very long time.  We left with a refund of course but no apology whatsoever from the staff.", "date_of_review": "7 January 2021"}
