So I took my friend there this week to have the cold meze after a long walk. We sat outside due to the social distancing and ordered our food. The service so far seemed ok and nothing to complain about. As we began eating the various dishes I noticed that the hummus tasted funny and I asked my friend what she thought. She said it tasted \u2018fizzy\u2019 which meant it was \u2018old\u2019 and I agreed. We didn\u2019t eat any more of it and called the waiter over and told him. He said \u2018ok\u2019 and disappeared inside to the restaurant- we thought to get fresh hummus. He didn\u2019t return. So then I called the waitress over and told her the same thing. She said \u2018ok I tell\u2019 and she disappeared off inside. She didn\u2019t come back either. We soon finished the rest of the food and asked for the bill assuming that the complaint re the hummus would be reflected in the total of the bill. She brought the bill and said nothing about the hummus and there was no reduction in the cost. She went to get the card machine and when she returned I asked her to take off the service charge because we couldn\u2019t eat the hummus. She said \u2018service charge is automatic\u2019 so I said \u2018as we couldn\u2019t eat the hummus and you didn\u2019t replace Or apologise for it we won\u2019t be paying for it\u2019 She was very hostile and grabbed my friends card from her Hand and muttered something while shoving it into the machine. We were really taken aback. My friend asked for the receipt and the waitress literally threw it in front of her on the table!  As we got up to leave the waitress whipped the remaining dishes off the table and gave us the dirtiest looks almost throwing us out. My friend has the receipt but to be honest we didn\u2019t even check if she took off a couple of Quid (service charge \u00a32.30) as we were so relieved just to leave at that point.  I emailed the restaurant later explaining how surprised we were at this hostile treatment and asking for a manager to contact me but had no reply whatsoever.  I\u2019d like to think that if a manager knew that one of his staff treated customers in such a manner they would be reprimanded as it shouldn\u2019t bring the reputation of the whole business into disrepute  However I have no evidence that anyone bothered to pick up on the issues.  So with that in mind - much as I like the food - I won\u2019t be returning", "date_of_review": "23 August 2020"}

Non of the waiting staff are wearing face masks. Most customers are coming into the restaurant with no face masks on, whilst being taken to their tables.  Whilst we where sat at our pre booked table, another 2 people came in to eat without a booking. No contact details where taken from them. I was very surprised the waitress allowed them to chose the table to sit at. They chose a table next to us, which they had to squeeze past behind us, whist not wearing a face covering. This table did not allow the right amount of distance from our table, which caused me and my husband to have to move up along our table, whilst we were eating. We also noticed seated areas where not sanitised after use. I spoke to a member of staff regards these situations, which they knew they were breaking the rules but felt they could not work with following the rules. My husband and I , paid for the food we ate, then left the restaurant as we did not feel safe.  Shame the starter we had we enjoyed. Would I go back again, no.

We had to call the severes few times to get our drinks or even starters but the table next to us were treated better plus they were at their beck and call while we had to wait several times to get their attention, towards the end I notice they offered them drinks on the house ( the restaurant is very tight in space so they are right beside us) and gave them a card to give reviews, even then we had to call them to get our bill and to pay as well we had to keep getting their attention I m not bothered about the free drinks it\u2019s just the different treatment for us being Asians I felt quite uncomfortable.

The main was just one kebab and a bit of rice. Other restaurants do an entire platter for \u00a320. But I thought since I like this place when I eat in it will be worth the \u00a39-12 per dish I was paying. It was not. The salad was out of a bag, with nothing else added to it not even lemon juice, it was just leaves, not the usual you get when you eat in with carrots, pomegranates etc. The meat was dry and horrible as if it was cooked a long time ago not freshly. And then there was the \u2018home made\u2019 baklawa. It was OLD. It had gone off, I took a bite and had to spit it out. It was soft smelt and tasted like cheese that had gone off. Absolutely repulsive. It was also \u00a34.50 for 3 pieces. How can they send food like that to people? It was not home made and had clearly been laying around for a LONG time. The order arrived far too quickly as well so it was clear it wasn\u2019t freshly cooked. I do not recommend this place at all. Hygiene isn\u2019t up to scratch during these coronavirus times clearly.

We ordered the Gezi platter 3 for all of us, 6 platters in fact and the food was absolutely delicious! Everyone was super impressed. The meats were all soft and tender, very flavoursome and so much to go around. We ended up taking several take away boxes as we just could not finish it all there! My nephew is 3 and is allergic to egg, after ordering him some nuggets and chips we soon realised they were dipped in egg. The chef makes the nuggets in house, he quickly whipped up some chicken shish and it was a great hit with the kids! Plenty of warm bread to go around and they kept on replenishing the bread baskets, you certainly won\u2019t ever leave hungry! A massive thank you to our waitress Anna, she looked after us so well and nothing was too much trouble. She really was fantastic and made us feel very welcome and valued as customers. Real service at its best, she is a real credit and it did not go unnoticed. I know sometimes such a large group like ours can be a bit of a handful, but she did not break a sweat and all with a smile on her face.   If you are thinking of visiting, don\u2019t think twice. I know we will be back, was a great place for our celebrations and Gezi Park really was the perfect choice for us, I\u2019m sure it will be for you too!", "date_of_review": "11 August 2019"}

No problem! We just had a terrific 80th birthday party dinner here for 27. Food was amazingly good, and terrific value. I'm surprised some of us got past the starters, there was such a great choice. And the chocies were just as plentiful for the mains. The lamb was generously portioned and meltingly succulent. The fish was a delight for the birthday girl. Our veggies were suitably impressed by the stuffed aubergine and moussaka. Staff were attentive but unobtrusive and nothing was too much trouble. Beautiful breads, salads olives. problem was we were all too full for desserts, so will have to pop back another time for that experience too.

When I eventually got it and asked why no one checked the food, a waiter told me he didn't take the order on the phone and so it wasn't his fault. I said that's unprofessional as they're all from the same establishment, but she said he didn't care and blamed it on the chefs.  When I got home my food was cold and the portions were small.

Succulent lamb ribs that had a lot to bite on, fresh salad, bread was sprinkled with oil and they also served really spicy turkish Chilly I loved so much.

Good ventilation so its authentic charcoal grill didn't soak your clothes with bbq fumes.  What's more, I was never into turkish sweets as they normally come soaked in sugar/honey syrup but this one was different and i recommend everyone to try for sure.

This is one of a few great restaurants on the Wanstead High Street, but if you're seeking excellent Turkish in London, it's well worth the tube fare to E11. A versatile menu, expertise behind the grill and thoughtful service make this place unique. It's also great value.  Before any of the dishes arrive, there's fresh pita with olives and sauces -- the chilli sauce is just the right kind of spicy. The salad is always pleasantly surprising. Try the halloumi and sucuk and the albanian liver if that's your speed, but the mezze menu is extensive with plenty of tamer options. The kebabs are a lot of food for a couple -- we usually order one meat and one vegetarian dish. My mouth is literally watering as I think of the lamb. We're not into dessert, and yet we always order the baklava.  The hard-working staff are friendly and accommodating, although I can't imagine needing anything that isn't happily given already. Many months ago, we once watched a troublesome table hassle the waiter for something that was their own fault. I mention this only because the waiter and manager responded with impeccable grace. I was already sold on the food, but it was nice to catch a glimpse of the character of the business.  Gezi Park got deservedly busier after winning the Guardian Food Awards, so call for a table.

The card machine did not work so we had to go to a cash machine but I felt a bit uncomfortable. There was no atmosphere and we were sat by a drafty window.

Go for their grilled meat options, which are all very good. Their lamb beyti is particularly delicious. I'm also a fan of their freshly grilled Turkish bread, and which is prepared to order. Warm and savoury from the grill, it's a real treat.  The basics are all there, and they're really good. I wish that they would put as much effort into their mezze as their meat, which still lags behind competitors like Mangal 2 in Hackney.  More thought into other sections of the menu and some homemade authentic Turkish desserts and this place would be a real gem. At the moment, it's a diamond in the rough.

This turned out to be incredible value, when we got our food, as the quality and size of dishes was much higher than you would guess for that price. We opted for the 2 courses, and chose different dishes, so we could share. I had a glass of wine from the very reasonably priced wine list, and when asking for a glass of tap water, was given a whole jug, with ice, mint and lemon. Way beyond the call of duty! The food came quickly, but not suspiciously so, and everything we chose was delicious, especially Mucver, a courgette croquette dish, which we had never heard of before. The waiter charmingly told us what herbs were used, when we asked about it. We also loved the green bean starter, Yesil Fasulye.

We were out of site of the staff, and out of mind. It took ages to order drinks and for dips and starters to arrive. Other tables which were occupied after we sat down were served well before us. Our second bottle of wine never arrived, though to be fair wasn't added to the bill either. Staff ran in with plates of food, whacked them down and scuttled off, impossible to catch anyone's eye. My main course of salmon cost \u00a315 and was served with anaemic chips and a boring side salad. It was a thin tail portion, really not suited to grilling, and was overcooked, leathery and uneatable. No-one came to check on us while we were eating and by the time the plates were cleared, we just wanted to leave. The chopped fruit served alongside the bill was good though.

The service from all the waiters/waitresses was dreadful, the worst service I have ever encountered in a restaurant. They were rude as we asked if we could change tables due to a large party making an awful lot of noise next to us. They brought up main courses before the starter plates had been removed. They collected plates even though people were still eating. I did say to the waiter someone is still eating and he said \"I know\"! The food was very sparse and overcooked.One of our party asked for chips instead of rice to be told NO we cannot do that, so we had to order another portion of chips. When the main meal arrived I said I thought all the main meals came with salad and was told that salad would be coming separately. We had 2 small bowls of salad between 6 of us. The salad had no dressing and was not chopped like a good Turkish restaurant normally does. The staff were very scruffy as was the restaurant.

The venue is nicely decorated but the atmosphere was dire for lunch. You could hear a pin drop, it almost felt awkward to speak, maybe a bit of music would help and some social interaction from the waitresses, possibly a smile just to break the otherwise strangely tense atmosphere. The venue certainly charges at the higher end for Turkish food in London, but falls well short with service. I spent ages, along with a few other diners staring into what felt like a black whole when trying to get the attention of the waitresses during a time when the restaurant was not busy.

The food was decent enough, lamb ribs succulent and it was all quite tasty, but the rice portion, bread portion and salad portion were not great and overall I think it was very poor value for money and what I would have expected to pay in Kensington or Central London somewhere.

The menu was large and there was a fixed lunch section as well as a separate al a carte menu. We ordered Taramasalata, Albanian Liver, Tatsiki and along with copious amounts of bread accompanied by a delicious chili based dip, very moorish. The main course was Moussaka, Lamb chops, Lamb skewer and the 3 guys shared a Gezi Park special. We were warned prior to the special arrived about not overindulging in the delicious bread and dips. The meals were all beautifully cooked and prepared and served. We finished off by taking Turkish coffee accompanied by home made Turkish delight and Baklava.  We were all impressed by the standards, cleanliness and ambiance, definitely a find in amongst all the eating establishments in and around Wanstead. as far as value for money, spot on.

Such a lovely evening - the atmosphere was very pleasant. The restaurant looks very classy, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to all my friends and family. You must try.

You are always welcomed at the door with a smile and great service being looked after throughout your dinner.  The food was amazing, selection and variety of food means that there is something to accomodate for everyones needs and tastebuds. The dishes are made freshly in front of you in the open kitchen which is very clean and well maintained.  We also ordered some food for take out and this was catered for on time and with the same great service and quality.  Highly recommend this place if you would like great food and reasonable price with the a great atmosphere.", "date_of_review": "1 December 2014"}

That's Best in Show in the UK and deservedly so. Easy to overlook for Review on the grounds of close proximity and frequency of visits. The food is outstanding: lamb chops and the freshest pomegranate salad to die for and the Malbec superb. All served up by Julya and the team with charm and hospitality. I don't know anyone with a bad or mediocre word to say. Oh, and good value too, with said lamb chops and Malbec at \u00a325/head, although plenty of veggie and mocktail options if that is not your thing. One of the very best.

Booked a table for 7pm and place was fairly empty when we got there but by the time we left it was really busy. I think booking is definitely required on Sat night. Lovely waitress took drinks order first. I had never had Turkish wine before and when I ordered it she said if I didn't like it then I could change it. I didn't need to.. Had 2 glasses :-) We had a few different starters.. Haloumi, Turkish sausage and meatballs. All delicious. Nice bread also served. 2 of us went for chicken shish kebabs, 1 had the lamb chops and the other had chicken wings. All were served with rice and salad. Just enough rice.. Sometimes they can give too much. The mains were really tasty. Not much room left for dessert but 2 of them managed to share a piece of cheesecake. This is a lovely restaurant. It was a lovely evening and we could have taken advantage of the outdoor seating but opted for indoors.  Only negative was it was very fast service (some might say that's a good thing). Next time we would order our starters and when finished would order the mains. Less than 120 for 4 people which included 2 large glasses of wine and 2 beers with 4 cokes. Service charge was included. Looking forward to our next visit!", "date_of_review": "6 September 2014"}

The manager took our number and said he would call to let us know when a table was free. We wandered off and found another local restaurant. However, I did receive a call within half an hour, but had to say we would book another time, as we had seen enough to make us want to go back. This time, we booked in advance and we were not sorry we did. We were warmly welcomed when we arrived by staff who were impressively attentive, engaging and friendly throughout. As it was our first time here, we decided to choose a starter each and then a mixed grilled meat platter. The starters were generous in size and, as there were four of us, we were pleased that there were at least 4 pieces in each portion, as opposed to those annoying places where they insist on supplying on 3 to a party of 4. The sarma and calamari were particularly good. The platter, as with the starters, was of a very generous size. We had a mix which included chicken wings, lamb chops, lamb ribs etc, together with rice and salad. Each of the meat portions were wonderfully cooked and flavoured and we only just made it through the course. I can only comment on one of the desserts, as two of us never have them and one does not eat chocolate, so that limited her choice to ice cream, which she did not want. However, the cheesecake portion ordered by my son soon vanished! Despite the comments from a previous reviewer, we found the staff to be very busy, but always friendly and efficient.  As for the cost, we paid \u00a382, including tip, so at just over \u00a320 per head, I thought that was excellent value.  We eat out quite regularly and always score our experience and this one scored very highly. We will be back and suggest you try it out too. All in all, a very relaxed and enjoyable meal, so this one come highly recommended.", "date_of_review": "30 August 2014"}

We were celebrating a birthday and so enjoyed cocktails, starters, a main course and dessert, all of which were excellent. You are given free appetizers and the most delicious flatbread whilst waiting for the food which almost filled us up! Most of us had kebabs and they were excellent. Only four people could manage a dessert which included the cheesecake and rice pudding which surprised us by being cold but still delicious. If you like kebabs you won't be disappointed.
