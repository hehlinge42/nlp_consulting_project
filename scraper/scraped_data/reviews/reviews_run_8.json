I ordered the Roast Rump of Beef w/Horseradish Cream Sunday Roast that was served with the usual roast accompaniments. The Roast Beef was good in portion size and quality, but no horseradish cream? I did ask for mustard, which promptly arrived. The Yorkshire pudding was big and looked very appetising, but I\u2019m afraid you could tell it had been lying around along with the roast potatoes. One appreciates that these items cannot be cooked to order, however from the time the orders were taken to when they were actually served they could have been cooked from scratch. The restaurant did apologise for the delay. Apart from the roast potatoes the other portions of vegetables were ok but were disappointingly meagre. A side dish of cauliflower cheese was ordered which was ok. I also sampled the Roast shoulder of lamb, which was good.  Shared desserts followed which consisted of Sticky Toffee Pudding w/butterscotch sauce and ice cream and Apple Crumble Cheesecake. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was very good with the sponge being light and served with a good butterscotch sauce and vanilla ice cream. However, the Apple Crumble Cheesecake was most disappointing and could be described as nondescript. It wasn\u2019t served looking like what traditional cheesecake would look like (that doesn\u2019t really matter); this rectangular dessert did not taste neither like apple crumble or a cheesecake filling. Apart from the apple being a bit tangy (which was nice) I could not have in anyway told you what this dessert was. The only good thing about the dessert was the vanilla ice cream. In general the quality of the Sunday Roast was good apart from some of the points that I have raised, but feel overall it was too expensive for a pub lunch. Remember you are charging \u00a318 for a Roast Lunch in West London not Central London / City territory, so portion sizes should also be equal in all aspects of the meal. The desserts charged at \u00a36.50 are expensive especially when one of them was actually a nothing dessert. When you are charging this sort of money your product needs to be top notch, this dessert was not. What was noticeable was that the food was served warm to hot in a hot plate - something that I have not really found in other establishments (i.e. the hot plate) and it is a very good practice.  Apart from the delay of the serving of the main meals the service was good in relaxed ambience considering it was busy. The bill for 3 diners was just under \u00a3100 for a few soft drinks, a cappuccino, 3 roasts, 1 side dish and 2 desserts. There was no alcohol, starters or even complimentary bread and butter, which some eateries provide you with these days. So you can draw your own conclusions as to whether it\u2019s good value for money?", "date_of_review": "25 February 2019"}

At a very minimum they should be aware that you have chosen to NOT make your restaurant DDA compliant. It is bad enough that you are not compliant, but for your staff to 'confirm' on two occasions that you have a wheelchair accessible toilet when you do not is not good enough. When we booked we enquired about wheelchair access and the availability of a wheelchair accessible toilet. We were advised that \"there is one small step down\" to the level where the toilet is and that \"wheelchairs have been in before\". Later that day, just before leaving to drive to the restaurant we called again to confirm that the toilet was wheelchair accessible and were assured a second time that it was. Both times the member of staff answering the phone seemed inexperienced but asked another, presumably more senior, member of staff for confirmation/answers. On arrival we learned that even to access the restaurant - via two steps for which there is apparently a ramp available - a potted plant would need to be moved to allow a wheelchair to enter. (You knew we were coming with a wheelchair!) On entering it was discovered that the toilet is down a narrow corridor with a tight corner that a standard wheelchair cannot navigate. The toilet itself is then a standard cubicle that cannot accommodate a wheelchair and its user, never mind a carer/assistant. Put simply, you DO NOT have a wheelchair accessible toilet. If asked in the future - be it by potential customers or legal compliance inspectors - maybe you would be so kind as to be honest about this. You may argue that 'with assistance' your restaurant is accessible to wheelchair users, BUT you cannot and should not be claiming that you have a wheelchair accessible toilet. As such we had a family night out ruined by a wasted tourney to your restaurant. Wheelchair users have to plan outing far more carefully than able bodied people at the best of times, but to find on arrival that you have been given such blatantly misleading information is beyond frustrating. The law is very clear on equal access for people with disabilities, giving misleading information goes beyond even this. - The Access Inspector", "date_of_review": "15 April 2018"}

Having read all the raving reviews, I was really hopeful. The pizza arrived relatively quickly was hot indeed. However, both I and my wife found the pizza base really hard and chewy. We struggled using the cutlery as it was not pre-cut into slices. The sauce had good flavour however wasn't spread evenly. The mushrooms were undercooked and hard on the Mare Monti, but the smoked samon chunks on the Salmone pizza had really nice favour. We've had lot better pizzas and for the price we didn't feel that we got value for money. The chicken nuggets and chips were really good.  Given the number of staff I counted on premises, the service was slow and unengaging. Took a long time to get someone's attention to order some desserts and one of the items was not delivered but promptly put on the bill. Even more time to complete payment.

Needless to say I was far from impressed. On a positive note the location and views are pleasant but the food was hard to rate as anything above average.  First of all I asked for a table by the window upon booking and the restaurant granted this request. After sitting down for 10 mins we were then told we were sat at the wrong table as there was another booking under the same surname for 4 people. Surely it\u2019s not hard to work out the difference between both bookings when they have different group sizes? After my partner and I then moving table we then had our starters which was the Scallops and the Calamari which were pleasant enough. My main course of Lamb Shank was terrible. Tough meat and the rice bomblasted with Parsley making it pungent to taste. Couldn\u2019t eat it.  I notified the manager who was abrupt and rude. Still hungry I ordered dessert which was panna cotta as it\u2019s a favourite of mine. This was presented beautifully. Yet the taste was an abomination. Too much gelatin gave the consistency of jelly and the taste was lacking any flavour or depth. Two mouthfuls was enough.  If you want to experience a good Italian then steer clear of this one !

On the other hand the food was a real disappointment in that there was nothing wrong with it but definitely nothing right. We ordered fried calamari as a starter. What we could were these perfectly round thin rings that looked like it came directly from a bag of frozen squid. Very homogenous and tasteless. I had the sea bass. It was made wrapped in aluminium foil with steamed vegetables. It had the potential to be great but...... The whole fish on the bone was tiny, it was not at all fresh, you could smell and feel the age of it. Unfortunately it was one of if not the highest priced dish on the menu and therefore was a very poor choice. In the world of British cuisine, this place offered the same blah food that all pubs offer. The pizza was dry and hard, the calzone looked the same.

My husband had a tuna pizza which he declared as 'absolutely delicious ' and which he was determined to finish (he did eventually!!). I had a mushroom risotto which was very tasty and very filling! The one small disappointment was my starter. I ordered Fungi - stuffed mushrooms served with a side salad. The mushrooms were delicious but there were only 2 on the plate!

A party of 4 booked a table on a Saturday evening. The restaurant was fairly busy. We waited at for over 25 minutes to have our order taken. The service throughout the whole evening was poor. The waitresses seem to be very inattentive. Two of us order scallops (these were okay). Two of us ordered calamari. The portion was incredibly small. We counted six rings of calamari on each plate. The calamari was extremely chewy. Considering we were paying \u00a39.95 a portion for this starter, to me seems rather expensive. We all decide to have pasta again I had a seafood pasta which was a great disappointment, as this again had squid in which was so chewy, 3 prawns and mussels. My sister had pasta with tiger prawns and cherry tomatoes in a wine sauce. This also was lacking in taste and very sparse in ingredients. The total bill with a bottle of wine came to over \u00a3148.00 for the 4 of us. We are more than happy to pay this but we all really felt this was overpriced for the quality of our food.

The main reason we decided to go to the specific place was that it was next to Hampton Court where we spent our morning. We ordered a number of starters and mains. The mains were of good size and fairly priced (but nothing special in terms of taste). However the starters were very limited in size and expensive. For example, for a portion of 6 (literally) calamari rings we ended paying \u00a39.95!  I mentioned to management that the calamari was expensive for what they charged and the reply I received was relatively rude: 'it is an appetiser and it is fish'. No acknowledgement that it was a complete rip off nor that they could do better. After all our bill was more than \u00a3130..... I don't think this restaurant is anything special.

Most recently visited a couple of week's ago. The food & service is superb. Friendly welcoming staff & very efficient too.

Unfortunately for me, not being cash rich, I return here for special occasions as against a casual weekend visit. Of the 6 at our table, we had 2 bottles of very good red wine (maybe about \u00a328/\u00a330 a bottle), tap water, couple of soft drinks, 3 starters, 6 main courses (one off the children's menu), 5 desserts, 2 Americano's, (no free Lemoncello this time round) including service came to around \u00a3220 (do the math = \u00a337 approx. per head).

The food is good, but on balance on the pricier end of the scale for this type of restaurant. Staff here are polite and welcoming. The big unknown is the ambience. This was the first time we'd experienced being there when a big group had been booked in and it was not a great experience. The entire back of the restaurant was laid out as a single table and there must have been 30-40 people noisily celebrating birthdays en masse. Inevitably when they were being served any of their drinks of food courses the rest of us had to sit and wait. Consequently after 3 hours we had only had starters and mains so gave up on desserts. I really cannot blame the staff - they were working really hard. Management need to have a strategy so that other diners aren't neglected in favour of groups. Quite quickly the noise and heat became unbearable - no chance of pleasant relaxed conversation - and the condensation was running down the windows with just a ceiling fan running. We were reduced to almost shouting to make ourselves heard. What pushed this review down to 3* in the end is that on coming home our daughter said we stank like prawn crackers. It must have been a fine mist of cooking fat coming from the kitchens as this morning I could smell our coats hanging in the hall and it really wasn't pleasant! If I was going back it would be on the basis that I had a plan B lined up in case I walked in and saw any of the restaurant laid out for a big group booking so that I could turn tail and walk away. I'd also want a table well away from the kitchen entrance - probably by the front windows is better. In speaking to some friends locally, it seems our experience is not unusual so maybe this place is getting a reputation for accepting large bookings. Shame really.", "date_of_review": "11 February 2017"}

La Fiamma is privately owned/operated and it shows. It has a pretty extensive menu and wine list, which is presented unconventionally to my mind - back to front, wines first then food. The restaurant has a welcoming, muted colour scheme with emphasis on dark wood floors embellished by lovely Victorian fireplaces, mirrors and paintings. Not the cheapest ristorante, but portion sizes are quite healthy, the cooking is very good, not exceptional or uber-creative but well above the average.

We had a table for 9 people for a friends birthday. Order the starters and mains together, not a problem at all. All the food came together which was good. My pizza was strange as I order a pizza that was described as Peperonni, mushrooms, ham and peppers . It came with the listed toppings in quarters on the pizza and was not that tasty. No desert was offered only the bill. Came to just over \u00a3300 with a 12% service charge added. We all paid for the bill and when we were about to leave the manager called over a couple of us to say that we had not paid enough and had taken \u00a357 pounds in cash. We explained to the manager/owner a female that we had paid the full bill with the waiter and she had added it up and the total amount was there. Then the manager was getting rude and would not listen, some of party had left the restaurant and the manager she it was down to us to prove we had paid by showing our card receipts. I said some people have left and to check the last transaction on her card machine which she refused. We told the manager that we were leaving as she was not listening and threatened to call the police and she was going to lock the door. The manager then grabbed hold of me trying to stop me and then tried to push past me to get to the door as she did this I lost my balance with her pushing me. The waiter then found the receipt next to the till and gave it to the manager. No apology was given. Thinking about it now while writing the review I wish the manager had called the police as I could have pressed charges for assault. I will never going back again and from other reviews it seems like the owner/manager does not like unhappy customers and she is always right.", "date_of_review": "25 September 2015"}

The shared starter of scallops with chorizo, chopped avocado and tomato, was delicious the scallops plumpseous (is that a word?!) and juicy. For the mains, my partner ordered Penne Con Carne, which looked plentiful, and she assured me was very tasty and meaty. I had fegato, calves liver with vegetables. The veg were hot and cooked al dente, the liver being two large slabs on onions. No problem with quantity! However, the first slab was full of gristle, which had not been removed, although this was disputed by the manageress despite the evidence on the side of my plate! as it was otherwise cooked reasonably, I decided to tackle the second slab; this was completely undercooked, not just pink but oozing blood, so inedible. The wine and coffee were fine. The cost of the fegato was not charged, so the bill came to \u00a352 including tip. My rating relates to the liver and the contention of the manageress.

The restaurant was very busy and had a good feel to it. Lovely views out to the park at the rear but sadly there were no window tables available due to a couple of large groups. Still we were happy with the table we had. Service was friendly - maybe a little slow, I put that down to it being busy, but I did feel on a few occassions when staff walked past us that they could have stopped to take out order - I was on the verge of having to catch someones eye when they eventually came over. To start I had the king prawn salad, which was delicious, my partner had the special of stuffed mushrooms in a bechamel sauce - it did seem to take an age for these to come - and although we like our food hot the mushrooms were almost nuclear in temperature!. I had the pork shank with apple sauce for my main and my partner had the Penne al sugo di carne. Whilst my pork was lovely his pasta was average - in his words 'he could make better at home' the description suggested that it would have a rich red wine and tomato sauce, which it did not, in fact when I tasted it the over riding flavour was of mushroom and I have to say the meat was pretty tough. I had the panna cotta for dessert - it was not as soft and creamy as many I've had before, almost felt as if there was too much gelatine in it - my partner had ice cream and there is not much that can go wrong with that. Although I have given just an average score it is somewhere we would try again as it has the potential to be so much better.

How long does it take to cook some garlic bread?? For our starter, we missed 1of our starter. After waited, we decided to grab one waitress which said she will go to see where is our last starter. Finally she arrived when we all finished our starter to ask what was the missing starter. What is the point to ask that when everybody else finished their starters??? We order with our main some red wine Nd they bring us some white wine. At this point, our meal was ruined with all their poor service.  We asked for the bill, and we're very surprise than nothing has been knocked off our bill. We aren't the kind of people to try to grab something for free but at this point with a long time to wait for our drinks, same for our garlic bread, a missing starter, wrong wine served, we though it would be fair to knock the garlic bread and a bottle of wine as our Christmas dinner has been ruin. To do short, worst attitude ever!! No customer service, no apologise,just threat and had to pay the whole bill for our worst Christmas meal ever!!

All our food and drinks were served within a reasonable time and all of good quality with all the staff working very hard to ensure we had a good service.

Me and my girlfriend wanted to visit for a long time, eventually made it one Sunday early November for a late lunch. Lovely setting with nice big windows looking onto Bushey Park.  Nice waitress offered parking permit, gratefully received. Good omens?! 2x glasses of red (\"Manzeriano\"?!) - very nice; things were looking up... Bread was provided on the table, very stale. Always a bad sign - the good omen U-turn?! Unfortunately, this is how it played out. Ordered the 'dello chef' to share - scallop skewers wrapped in Parma ham. Disappointing. Little flavour, left much to be desired, and the scallops were served on the skewers with the orange roe still attached. I had read someone's TA review claiming that the pizza here was the best they had ever tasted. I asked the waitress how they cooked their pizzas expecting they had a wood fired oven; they use an electric oven. The family on the adjacent table were served a couple pizzas shortly after - they looked supremely average. Completely flat and circular; no authentic character. I ordered the rigatoni with asparagus and peas. My girlfriend ordered the rigatoni with chicken, \"sweet\" peppers and olives. We had these dishes with the lamb shank with veg and potatoes. Both pastas were over cooked and their was little or no flavour in the sauces. The lamb shank (\u00a318) did not fall off the bone and was dry. The veg was very overcooked. Didn't bother with desert, based on the above. I was honest with the waitress when she asked how the meal was; she said she would feedback to the kitchen. Perhaps this was a one-off, however I wont be going back. I've had much tastier, more enjoyable meals at Carluccio's. Expected more based on the price, location, nice surroundings and appearance that this was an authentic Italian restaurant serving quality food. Disappointing.

It was a Monday night and quiet. The service was good and friendly. One of the waitresses managed to take our order successfully without writing anything down. The table was nicely decorated for Christmas with crackers etc. The restaurant looked pretty too.  There was a good choice of wines and the menu was quite extensive. There were nice starters, pastas, pizzas, risottos and grills. I had a goats cheese and aubergine starter which was very tasty as was the linguini with scallops. My husband had the garlic bread with cheese which he said was OK followed by the lamb shank which was excellent. For desserts we had the pannacotta which was great and the ice cream. There was a limited number of flavours with the ice cream, basically the usual suspects - vanilla, strawberry and chocolate, but they were full of flavour. There was a good choice of coffees as well.  The staff were willing to split the bill amongst the large group by couples and individuals so that we paid for exactly what we had which was very helpful. It was also good value. It was a very enjoyable evening, with a nice ambience and good quality food. I would recommend it and would go back. ", "date_of_review": "2 December 2014"}

The restaurant is full of character and the views are stunning. On top of that, the staff are so helpful and friendly. Nothing was too much trouble for them and, when a table by the window overlooking the park became free and we requested to move, it was no problem at all. They cleaned and re-laid the table beautifully for us, without any fuss and then moved our drinks and everything over. Then there's the food. Even something as simple as the salads on the antipasti menu are delicious and well executed. Simple flavours but brought together so well and using lovely produce. I had the seafood pasta Cartoccio, which was absolutely stunning, with huge prawns and all seafood cooked beatifully. I really can't fault this restaurant. It's a gem of an Italian I drove past all the time without realising how fantastic it is. In fact, it's so good, we're going back there with my parents this weekend.

WE couldn't have done more when we reserved a table and asked if the restaurant was accessible. We were told that there were 2 small steps but it wasn't a problem only to travel there to find it impossible to mount the 2 large steps. The restaurant had no ramp and didn't even seem apologetic! They said that they could 'lift' the chair in (impossible). Why is a business like this allowed to operate when it has been asked by legislation since 1995 to make 'reasonable' adjustments .. and has done nothing! Don't they understand how upsetting it is for disabled people not to be able to gain access to their services? Or degrading for people to offer to 'lift' them in and out? We then went to a restaurant 5 minutes away, who's building had a step and they happily brought out their ramp to allow access. I certainly would not support this restaurant by spending money there. If your conscience does well fair enough... but please ask them when you're there to make their restaurant accessible for everybody! Please 'La Fiamma\" get your act together and make the adjustments you should make!", "date_of_review": "17 September 2017"}

We have been here on a few occasions when meeting up with our old buddies whom we met on holiday in Sharm el-Sheikh nearly ten years ago (but that\u2019s a different story or rather, review).  Here at The Barley Mow, my son never tires of me telling him the story of the last duel which took place on Englefield Green. The story is written on the beam wall as you come down the stairs into the restaurant area. We always sit at the large table to the left as soon as you come down the steps which is tucked away in a corner, perfect for the youngsters and it is set away from the kitchen. The menu has particularly French influences ranging from moules marinieres to boeuf bourgignon to confit de canard to even North African flavours such as lamb tagine. The food is delicious, my son who is six years old has rather discerning taste and requested for a running commentary on the menu, refused the children\u2019s menu and promptly ordered the moules marinieres. The boeuf bourgignon was simply divine. It just melted in your mouth on a bed of mash almost but not quite submerged in a red wine gravy, just how I like it. For dessert, the pistachio souffle is out of this world. So light and fluffy accompanied by a dollop of chocolate flavoured ice cream \u2013 Yum! The kitchen is an open kitchen so you can see the chefs at work. The service is attentive and the servers know when you require a refill. They have very good customer service skills (compared to other places I have visited!) We spent a good 3-4 hours dining on a three course meal and there is never any rush for you to leave. We are usually the first to arrive and the last to leave for the lunchtime diners. A wonderful dining experience which will bring us back here again for another rendezvous with our chums from Sharm.", "date_of_review": "13 March 2019"}

Friends had pizzas, calzone and risottos and everyone was complementary of the food, so thumbs up all around.  For dessert I had an esspresso with vanilla ice cream inside. Never seen this before but tasted amazing. Others had cappuccinos which were made to a high standard and came with little amaretto biscuits.  Bill wasn't too bad at \u00a316/17 per head with just a main/drink/coffee. Overall, I recommend this restaurant for it location and food. ", "date_of_review": "2 September 2012"}

However, our dining experience was tarnished by a very uncomfortable display of unprofessional management, my wife and I were appalled at how the manager, who refused to give her name, treated the floor staff. We later found out this manager is called Anna. It was not only uncomfortable to watch but very upsetting, nothing more than outright 'bullying' and very unprofessional conduct. One waitress was yelled at for not collecting a table of empty glasses when she was struggling to balance plates and dishes on both her arms.

We ordered around 5.45 and our starters turned up in a timely way. Dinner took longer than we expected so we asked about it. The server said he\u2019d check. We asked again. Then we asked again about 6.55. And it transpired that the order hadn\u2019t gone to the kitchen. We\u2019d expected to be done by now and indeed the post cricket crowd were in and it was busy so we wondered if we should leave. We decided we should eat, so we re-ordered.  I spoke to Tom, the manager who was nice, offered the table drinks and actually had the food ready mostly immediately as at some stage it was realised and the order processed. I did suggest some focus and communication when it\u2019s going wrong might be sensible. The food did arrive promptly by about 7.05. Mine twice. (They forgot the egg as advertised). At this stage a competent young gent with a beard took charge of our table somewhat recognising that the experience was in the pan.  One of our party had ordered the mackerel. It was overly oiled. One could see, but they were hungry. A mistake, as they couldn\u2019t manage the amount of oil added to the potatoes and mix veg and felt nauseous.

We couldn\u2019t face dealing with more staff or managers, and I felt the stress levels were either bad for my heart or hatching ulcers, upon reflection we were all ok, so we escaped promptly. Will my local in laws be back? Probably not. But over the 70 plus years of being here, in Egham, the Barley Mow has had ups and downs. On a sudden downward curve it appears. Could do better.

The vast majority of people in the pub/dining room appeared to be having the one of the Sunday roasts that were on offer. Our table of 5 had a mixture of dishes including from the child's menu for my 5 year old. Everybody was very happy with their food, and considering we had a couple of fussy eaters that's not bad. In the main we ordered just mains and all very simple dishes (such as Sunday Roast or Fish and Chips), but all the food was well cooked. The deserts looked very appetising but the portion sizes of the main were very generous so no room for sweet! I would say prices are borderline high for a gastropub, but just about justified as both the service and food are so good. There are a few places now in Ealing with a good reputation for food, but I would say this pips most for this type of food.  Highly recommended.", "date_of_review": "17 January 2016"}

Fine there is a sign which me and another women didn't saw and when i reported it to her she just said yeah yeah without a look or a smile. At least say sorry we know there is a sign or whathever but come on you can't act like that. One man in the bar was finding her very rude as well.

We recently went back as we heard that it had undergone refurbishment, we were very surprised at the \"new look\" - the bar is still very similar to how it was but has been given a new lease of life and a fresh coat of paint.

Just need the sun to shine now to help them get more guests in (we're yet to dine outside).

Now the important bit... THE FOOD! All menu items that we have tried have been delicious and realistically priced, we asked for recommendations from Tom the first time we were there, and he made a few suggestions, he was spot on with his descriptions and we certainly were not disappointed.

The order was questioned and the manager simply said that there was no mackerel, but again no refund of the difference in price offered (we'd already paid at the bar when ordering). My friend happily ate the sardines but as it was such a light dish he decided to have dessert and so chose a dessert to the value of 6 pounds and explained when ordering that this had already been paid for, together with another dessert for which he was charged the menu price. I, personally was disgusted that no apology was offered for a staff mistake and that my friend was not immediately offered at least a refund of the 6 pounds price difference. A good restaurant would have offered free desserts all round with a profuse apology! On top of that my fish and chips were not good - the fish itself was fine but the batter was bland and slightly undercooked, and the chips did not taste freshly cut and fried either.

We were immediately made to feel welcome by Johnny and others behind the bar. What a pleasant surprise this impromptu lunch was! I had the Sunday roast beef which was excellent with lots of yummy veggies and my girlfriend had the stone bass which she said was very good. For dessert my girlfriend had the pistachio souffle which I was only allowed one bite of.... and after tasting it I couldn't blame her, it was very, very good.

I had the Duo Ravioli which was 5 pieces of ravioli served on a bed of peas and a bit of cabbage with a tasteless watery cream sauce. 2 pieces of the pasta just tasted sour (supposed to be Goats Cheese and Rosemary) and the other 3 pieces were bland with a hint of mint (supposed to be pea and mint). My husband had roast beef which he could not even cut as the quality of the meat was so bad. The Yorkshire pudding was solid as it was so overcooked and burnt and the accompanying vegetable which was supposed to be cauliflower cheese was again just a watery mess. When we complained he was offered the chance to swop to pork which was better but the Yorkshire and cauliflower remain the same. I was not offered any solution to my measly pasta portion and was told that is the amount you get. For \u00a312.50!! They also offer a half price for half portion for older children on some items on the menu and my daughter choose the beef burger which when it arrived was the size of what you might expect served at a cocktail party. To add insult to injury when the bill arrived they had automatically added the service charge when they knew we were not happy with our food.

Very nice inside with a cute back garden with the front overlooking a beautiful grassed area sometimes with a little cricket being played... so quite idyllic . The food menu has a good choice and the cheese souffl\u00e9 that 3 out of the 4 of us has for our starter was sublime.... Again 3 out of the 4 of us choice the roasted pork shoulder dish which was very melt in the mouth and not dry, but would've been enhanced with a little gravy .. or jus.... if one is feeling cheffy. Didn't indulge in the pudding but did order the cheese platter which was a very sad plate indeed. Stilton, Red Leicester and I think it was a strongish cheddar served alongside 3 biscuits, some walnuts and dried apricots. This could've been elevated with the addition of some french cheese.... the chutney would've been better served with a burger... it was too sweet. They also had 'run' out of 4 items that we requested...... no Hendricks (I know!!) had to chose another one, so choice of a single malt whiskey ( to use with a mixer) you don't want to be mixing your really good stuff with American dry after all. Fabulous choice of wines which weren't ridiculously expensive. And other little bits and pieces weren't available. The staff were totally brilliant.... big shout out to Olivia, who was friendly and helpful and very attentive. Would I recommend you go? Oh yes, please do. We will be going back and as I said before the food is very good and best of all not silly money.

Unfortunately they were just not worth the price. The mussels were full with sand and grit, obviously not washed or soaked for long enough, which made them unpleasant. They had also been cooked for far too long, which made them discoloured and odd in texture. Steak slightly overcooked for what we asked for. Scotch egg small and piccalilli definitely not a traditional piccalilli... Garlic bread recommended by waitress, but was far too oily... the oil was dripping down my hand!

Refurbished within the past twelve months and under new ownership, this pub restaurant has been open since the end of last year. The new look, ambiance and menu is all good. Service from the waiting staff also good. However on the three occasions we have booked a table one more waiting staff would have made a positive difference. The food has generally been well prepared (apart from the kitchen taking a couple of attempts to produce the food as ordered). The menu whilst not large is good. The bad: on our first and third visits kitchen service was pretty poor. Over an hours wait for main courses and then issues with the main course order. This was added to a delay in one of the meals arriving at the table. Since all the meals were hot they would have spoiled to have waited for late/corrected meals so we could not all eat at the same time. The kitchen service based on our experience is simply not good enough and needs to improve. On our second visit, having booked in advance, a party arriving ahead of us, not booked, were shown to what had been \"our table\". We had arrived fifteen minutes before the booked time so there was no excuse. We were offered an apology, and a free bottle to sit at a round table for three - there were four of us plus a large dog so not practical! We declined and waited for a table for four. Three tries and all with some disappointment. There are other good, if not better places to eat in this area and the food here whilst good will not carry the day and overcome for us the short-comings we experienced for this establishment.  We will try again,at some point, in the hope of improvement, but not anytime soon.", "date_of_review": "26 June 2017"}

One roast beef much the same story, nicely cooked tender beef, plenty of veg, perfectly done yorkshire. If there could be one small gripe I would have liked some green veg rather than just braised cabbage (broccoli/peas/green beans would have been nice) - but neither of us could quite finish the portions which were perfectly judged so we were certainly not left wanting.

Was a little worried as a friend was vegetarian but there were options available. All four diners were really happy with the food and will definitely be visiting again.

This was our first visit to the Brasserie and first impressions were pleasing. The environment was warm and welcoming with friendly and helpful bar staff. After taking a drink in the bar area we moved through to the restaurant which, although it was early evening and quiet it had a lovely feel to it and an interesting aspect of a full view of the Pass and food preparation beyond. We were welcomed by Johnny who I believe is the General Manager and who's guidance and attention to detail along with his cheerful but unassuming friendly manner was faultless . Here is a young man who doubtless will prove a major asset to the company. Our food was cooked perfectly, beautifully presented, hot and tasty. On enquiring Johnny mentioned that the majority of the food that is served in the restaurant is made in house, that in itself is a bonus when cooked this well. In short we will definitely return, possibly to try the Sunday lunch. Well done the Barley Mow and extremely well done Johnny, keep up the good standards and do make sure to re stock the Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry.

The kids menu was not great either but was well priced. We all found desert lacking anything great compared to our meal. The service was great and I loved the venue.

So we did ....... While the service was good given the restaurant was packed out, the food at best was luke warm, all 5 of us ordered the Beef, it was served 'worryingly' quickly and on a non heated plate the food was just about warm, we complained and was given an apology and new vegetables, when these were served they only came out a little warmer than the vegetables served with the meal. The restaurant's offer of unlimited vegetables, roast potatoes and yorkshire puddings was a little farcical as by the time we had ordered the 'extras' they were served after we had finished the meal.

We arrived a 7pm to a fairly busy bar but by no means overrun, ordered drinks and sat at a small table by the window. The table had previously been occupied and there was an empty crisp packet, 3 empty glasses and some used tissues adorning the surface. These were not cleared away for more than half an hour; a poor start. We went down to the restaurant at 7.45 and a charming young lady introduced herself and explained the specials of the day, we had a table right by the open kitchen which was buzzing and thought \"excellent\" We ordered some drinks and nibbles, just a basket of bread and a garlic baguette. The bread took 10 mins and the garlic baguette about 15-20 minutes after prompting the waitress ! Two of our friends were 5 minutes late arriving and whilst they ordered drinks straight away these were not delivered for at least another 10 minutes and again required prompting. Next was the starters; 6 people = 6 starters a fairly simple equation but 10 mins after the first 5 had arrived we had to prompt the waitress again and she hurried to the pass where we watched the forgotten starter being prepared. I should also note that the restaurant was not at capacity, with several empty tables around. On to the main courses and we were all sitting with empty glasses again as the drinks service was so slow, I felt sorry for the young lady who came to ask for our wine choices when she explained it was her first day and so little assistance could be offered. When the mains arrived they were excellent; the Chateaubriand was carved at the table just the way it should be and we finally had some wine. Whilst we all enjoyed our main courses it was almost possible to forget the level of service experienced but sadly this soon reared it's head again. Having finished our meal and returning to the bar for after dinner drinks, I chose a Beefeater gin according to the drinks menu served with pink grapefruit juice, unfortunately the glass was so full of ice that there was no room for any tonic, I asked the barperson about the tonic only to be told that it would be extra; after pointing out the drinks menu which clearly states that all gin's come with a Fever Tree tonic I had to ask for the ice to be drained out of the glass and repoured, the same happened with my sons Hendricks gin. Finally to cap it all the bill arrived with a \u00a330 service charge added, I asked for this to be removed, the lady then went to get a manager, I believe his name was Tom, Tom went to the till, adjusted the bill and handed it back to the barperson. he made no attempt to ask why we were not happy, apologise or even communicate with us in the slightest. If the leader of the team has no interest in customer service then it is no surprise that this filters down through the ranks. In summary, the food was great but the lack of service ruined the experience, I really wanted to like this place as it used to be my local for over 10 years but I won't be rushing back.", "date_of_review": "8 January 2017"}

My garlic bread arrived and was cold with frost still visible underneath, a cremated shrunken replacement came back after about 10 mins, which wasn't great. Mains came, I hade the beef stroganoff which wasn't great either, but the other 3 meals seemed ok. Once the table was cleared, we waited another 1/2 hour before the same waitress came to us, to reset the table with knives and forks and asked if we had ordered our meal ..... we told her we where waiting for a desert menu, eventually 3 deserts where ordered and a white coffee, the coffee came with no milk followed by the deserts. At no time did anybody ask ask if all was ok, was the food ok, it just seemed really bad service with the waiting staff going through the motions. I did complain at the end to the guy that checks you in on arrival, (I did ask to speak to the manager, but he didn't explain who he was to me), who apologised and refunded the deserts and the garlic bread, and explained that being newly opened, it was early teething problems that would get resolved and hoped that we would return at a later date.

The venue has recently been taken over and refurbished and is fabulous light, airy yet vibrant. The menu is short but has plenty to choose from. I started with the Cromer crab pot which was delicious, moist and tasty. My wife had the cheese shuffle which was amazing.  We then had the Chateaubriand between us, cooked rare and delivered absolutely perfectly. Seared on the outside and perfectly rare throughout. The portion size was perfect, enough to be satisfied and not so much as to be wasted. My wife had the scallops which were served beautifully and I did not get to try them as she refused to let me near them they were that good.  Our host Lawrence, I think, was brilliant attentive and responsive but not intrusive. We had wine by the glass from the excellent wine list.

We have now dined twice at the Barley Mow, once in the upstairs pub area and the other in the downstairs main restaurant and have been disappointed both times.  The service is poor, with young and poorly trained staff, seating crowded and over run by noisy and uncontrollable children.

The food at the Barley mow needs attention. The cheese souffl\u00e9 was not light enough in texture and was luke warm at best. Unbelievably, they ran out of mussels at 6pm on a Wednesday evening meaning we had to reorder two mains. The substite of chicken and mushroom pie was not good at all and contained very little meat and sadly was swimming in a tasteless, watery and greasy sauce/gravy and it was also 80% pastry. The lobster tail is tiny and only comes with a tiny portion of chips for a whopping \u00a324.00 The CHATAEUBRIAND for two for \u00a350.00, was also tiny and certainly didn't look as if it came from the thickest part of the fillet as it sloped to a smaller thickness at the end. Whilst my companions felt it was very nicely cooked to order and very tasty, it certainly did not represent good value for money for its size and unfortunately only comes with nothing but two small slices of tomato. Simple things like French fries cost extra and the portions are again tiny and presented in a small side bowl.  However, there is some good aspects here, as with their other UK venues and has been mentioned many times before on this site, the pistachio souffl\u00e9 is exceptional and a real USP for the chain. Finally, I cannot compliment the staff here enough, they are all friendly and professional at all times. Lovely venue but both drinks and food prices are way out of kilter for a local pub dinner, albeit a RB brasserie one. If marketing operations ever read these reviews Please give some thought as a chain about giving better value for money especially with portion sizes and perhaps include French fries or complimentary sides as part of the meal. It would be a low cost high payoff result for all.", "date_of_review": "5 August 2017"}

It was a sunny friday evening so we booked in advance. We were shown promptly to the table which was near the pass which we found fascinating watching the chef's work. I had the salmon gravidlax which was deep smokey in taste with creme fresh to cut through and my friend the potted crab which I could have easy gobbled up too. For main we shared the Chateaubriand with and a selection of veg and potatoes which cut like butter. Best piece of beef I've had for a long time. I couldn't fit dessert in but had enough room for another gin and tonic! Well priced for what you get. Service was great, staff very professional still take time to talk too you personally.

Olivia, our waitress was very helpful and attentive. We have been to the Barley Mow several times since it's renovation and it is home to a lovely pub and restaurant.  However, I am increasingly concerned regarding the standard of the food. I had to send my meal back last time as the pork was over cooked. This was changed with no discussion and I thought it might have been a one off. However having visited yesterday with friends, I was concerned at the portion sizes and quality of the food. We had a papaya salad which was, for the price of \u00a38, substandard with little to no papaya in evidence and just a handful of leaves. The snails could be served with more bread.  For the mains, I had the rib special and they were good but again, over priced and this is not a complex dish just coming with a few chips. Other dishes were nice but very small portions given the generally over \u00a320 main course charges.  This is a great place to meet family and friends and the waiting staff are, in my experience, excellent. We really enjoyed spending the evening with close friends and that is what it is all about. However, I would urge the management to ensure that the quality of the dishes are reviewed, and most importantly for people who are both new and potentially returning customers, commensurate with the prices being charged.

Almost 10mins after that a waitress arrived asking for our order, even though we had no menus! This isn't bad service, it's NO service. Our food was ok but certainly not worth the price we paid. (see food pics) My partner's pork chop was over-cooked, dry and very fatty. My cauliflower & roquefort quiche was actually a pie but I don't think the chef knows the difference. The size of the piece of quiche I received was barely the size of my palm - the rest was a leaf salad with oil for dressing and 3 baby potatoes which were clearly reheated after they had already been heated before (you could tell in the taste). My plate was overgrown with the salad and frankly it's an insult to charge \u00a312.50 for a plate of salad leaves and oil!!!

A friendly reception at the bar, the restaurant manager, the drinks waiter and waitresses (not short on staff!). A good selection of foods and drinks(Beer and wines) with an Anglo-French leaning. As it was UK 'school Summer' I ignored the salads and went for the simple warm options; moules followed by the Steak frites.

A truly awful place, over priced, over crowded and lousy service. If your idea of fine dining includes paying over the odds for mundane food whilst sharing your space with kids and dogs this is the place for you. We had Sunday lunch a few weeks ago - mediocre, over priced and poor portions. This week the small bar area on the right as you enter had several diners shoe horned in which mean there was no where to sit so you had your drink penned at the bar surrounded by yet more dogs and kids. Seems the owners put profit over providing a nice experience for their customers. Everything about this place says price before value and it seems locals have voted with their feet given their scarcity. Nothing about the Mow recommends itself to anyone who has any discernment or taste. Avoid like the plague.", "date_of_review": "28 December 2016"}

The staff are as friendly and as helpful as ever and the menu is varied, interesting and reasonably priced. Also, wonderful to see some Cornish produce on the menu, my home county!

In the fifteen or so years that I've lived here it's always been a fairly average pub and never ever managed anything more than a notch above that which can be microwaved or put in a deep fat fryer. We locals have been waiting in anticipation when local gastro pub chain The White Brasserie Company (sister company of the well established Raymond Blanc franchise Brasserie Blanc) took over the Barley Mow . Over the last few months they have heavily invested in refurbishing and extending the premises breathing new life into the tired old building. Last night the second soft opening took place and I was lucky enough to secure a table to sample the fruits of their labours!  Located just 1/2 mile from my house and a brisk 10 mins walk we were looking forward to having a place to eat on our doorstep that didn't involve a taxi or train ride. On arrival we met the charismatic Johnny O'Connor, the GM steering the ship, a great host but obviously a man who takes his craft seriously as he skilfully manages his brigade of staff to deliver a fairly impressive service. Once inside, the decor is bright yet cosy. There is a small bar with a full range of pre dinner drinks and cocktails available including an outstanding Sauvignon Blanc on tap and a Fleurie!  If you are a lover of all things that is the drink of the moment; GIN, then this is the place for you! An impressive range of Gin's to suit all tastes from the classic Hendrik's to the stellar aromatic Gin Mare. The dining area is split on two levels; the new larger lower level looks into the open kitchen, a signature feature of Brasserie Blanc's, revealing an openness and transparency of what goes on in the kitchen!  As its a chilly night outside we opt for the slightly more intimate and cosy upper floor and choose a table adjacent to a roaring log fire, it's warmth a welcome addition to the ambiance. After taking some time to cogitate and deliberate over the extensive menu, I'm seduced by the Hake for mains which I had a year ago on a visit to Brasserie Blanc in Winchester and which wowed me then. My other guests make their choices and I order a delicious Pouilly Fum\u00e9 at a very modest mark up on retail price. It's crisp and fresh and the perfect partner to my choice of starter... Starter Rainbow smoked beetroot & goat\u2019s curd salad, balsamic dressing & beetroot crisps. One of the best iteration's of this classic that I've tasted. The secret... The beets are steamed separately unpeeled to preserve colour, then peeled and cold smoked in their own in-house smokery. Finally, to finish the dark beets are marinated in a red wine marinade and the the lighter colours in a white wine marinade. The result a visual stunner that balances sweet and sour flavours with the lightness of the goat's curd. One course in and I'm already loving this place! Main Course Roast hake fillet with saffron sauce, mussels, clams, kale, new potatoes. I had already bigged up this dish to my guests and and wasn't disappointed when it arrived, the wonderful aroma from the saffron sauce tantalising my taste buds. The Hake cooked to perfection, crispy skinned and yet moist so that it's delicate flavour and texture could express themselves in the luxurious combination with sweet mussels and clams. Al dente kale and new potatoes provided an unfussy but necessary balance to the flavours on the plate. Wine number two was a budget favourite from Rare Vineyards; one whose modest \u00a323 price tag totally under estimates the sublime combination of Marsanne/Viognier that was the perfect partner to our quartet of fish that were our main courses.  Asking our waiter, Vince for a soup spoon to ensure that not a drop of the saffron liquor was wasted the only debris left on the plate were the discarded mussel shells! Cheese Course Selection of traditional seasonal artisan cheese; Double Gloucester, Keen\u2019s Cheddar, Yorkshire blue Having already decided unanimously as a table that we were all going for the French classic Tarte Citron we decided to share one cheese course between four. Beautifully presented with a tangy red onion marmalade and garnished with dried apricots and candied fruit the cheeses went down a storm. In my book Keen's Cheddar is up there as one of the greatest English cheddars that exists. Made the same way it was a hundred year's ago from raw unpasteurised milk it's flavours, strong deep and full of umami! The Yorkshire Blue creamy and yet with a delicious savoury saltiness! I could see myself popping in for a cheese course after dinner at home without the guilt of having a pound of cheeses tempting me in the fridge at home! Dessert Classic deep-baked lemon tart, cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche And so to dessert. A deep slice of sunshine with a lovely caramelised surface courtesy of chef's blow torch! The tart zing of lemon balanced perfectly with the custard creme filling and offset both decoratively and flavour wise with the off sour tang of a thick cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Bringing this triumphant finale to a close, to accompany the dessert we had a classic Muscat de Beaumes de Venise, one of my favourite sweet wines... But we were not done and in a defiant act to prolong our enjoyment of the evening further we ordered post dinner cocktails! Leg\u00e9r whose job it is to keep the wine and cocktails flowing took to making several new off piste cocktails to keep us happy in addition to her signature Espresso Martini! Espresso Martini using Stoli! A Barley Mow twist on the Brandy Alexander and of course the quintessential Bondesque classic Vodka Martini, shaken not stirred! Johnny, Tim and Vince by the log fire in the upper restaurant. All in all a fantastic night! If they can maintain this quality of service and food this is going to be a real local asset and transform the restaurant scene in the village. If you need any more of a recommendation I've just booked for Christmas Eve, but don't delay as they are already filling up..

Like a large chop with the crackling on the individual chop which was new to me but made for really super moist yet crunchy crackling. Starter for us was a salad, possibly a beetroot thing which was amazing and fresh. We really enjoyed it. I faced the kitchen and having been a Hotel Manager in a 5 star London Hotel it was actually exciting watching the head chef run the hot plate, making sure that staff acted swiftly but also that the food quality and presentation was spot on. We are talking highly presented dishes. We have popped in all week and ate on this occasion and have found the staff and management very welcoming providing an attentive service.- The Restaurant is separate to the bar and well worth a visit. The Barley Mow has been there for 300 years and a change like this, turning a grotty pub into a quality dining establishment will take a while for all to adapt - locals and wider community but for the first week an excellent start and we will be popping in again very soon.", "date_of_review": "5 December 2016"}

It has been taken over, and whilst the bar staff/owners were very friendly and welcoming, It was not a great experience. The only food one was a soup, a burger(over priced) and a choice of baguettes with fries. No Sunday lunch?? Who wants a burger on a Sunday? All the blackboard were covered with wine options, where there once would have been food. Anyway, we opted for baguettes. These were a disappointment. The cheese and onion one had very little topping, and the baguettes were thin and overbaked. There was a handful of salad leaves, and the chips were overdone and very salty. For \u00a35.95 I think the quality was poor. The other problem was the loud and intrusive 'rock' music playing. More suited to a city bar than a country pub. There are plans to re-vamp the place, which is fine, but I hope they just don't go all trendy and up all the prices, like the Hare and Hounds up the road.", "date_of_review": "24 January 2016"}

We used to come here often in our younger days, but haven't been here for a long while. The pub is on the green and has a good location. Inside it's only of average size, but has a large garden. My wife went to find a table whilst I ordered some drinks. Three beers on offer - Sharps ubiquitous Doom Bar plus Atlantic Bitter, together with Timothy Taylors Landlord. So for a pub in leafy Surrey we have two beers from Cornwall and one from Yorkshire. With so many local breweries to choose from, this is pretty shoddy. i had the Landlord and it was nothing special. I joined my wife ( she had cider) and she was still looking for a table. Many were in a poor state of repair - paint peeling off, damaged seating, etc, and it took us four goes to find a decent one.  Time to order food. We decided to have two specials - my wife went for canneloni stuffed with goats cheese and butternut squash, whilst I decided on the Butter Chicken Burger. I was served by a tall very thin woman. I gave her my order but she didn't seem to be listening, but staring over my shoulder. When i asked her if she'd got my order, she claimed to be deaf ! She eventually seemed to grasp what i wanted and took the specials board to the till, whereupon she proceeded to type into the till a vast quantity of writing. The lady who served me my drinks asked if I was being served, to which I replied \" I think so\". She went over to the typing girl and assisted her. I re-iterated my order to her - i got the impression this wasn't the first time she'd had to do this. We were supposed to have a numbered spoon for our table to identify us, but tall and thin didn't give us one. After about 15 minutes our meals arrived. Mine was supposed to have bacon and guacomole, but no sign of either. I went back to the bar and spoke to the drinks waitress who came over to the table. Yes...you've guessed... it was the wrong meal ! So away it was taken. Meanwhile my wife was eating her canneloni. She stopped half way through. \" I can't eat any more\" she said. \" It's lukewarm, stodgy and the filling has congealed.It's like it was cooked 30 minutes ago\". My correct meal then turned up. It was hot, and i had bacon and guacomole, although the chicken burger itself didn't taste hugely of chicken. Average at best. Eventually the drinks waitress came to clear our table. She asked my wife if her meal was OK, seeing that she left lots, so my wife told her. Drinks was very apologetic, and gave us the money back for her meal. This review flirted with getting just one point, but the drinks waitress and her attempts to keep the place afloat, made me give it two, but only just. One decent member of staff covering for the deficiencies of everyone else is not a good way to run anywhere, and I would advise you to steer clear of The Barley Mow for the time being.", "date_of_review": "9 August 2015"}

We waited a long time for our starters, pre ordered days ago, to come. The soup I had was delicious. However in the main course, the carrots were practically uncooked. They were inedible. The 'crispy roast potatoes' would have better fitted the description 'leathery roast potatoes' We had to make a request for additional gravy. There was no cranberry or bread sauce to accompany the traditional turkey. No jugs of water on the table. Having finished our disappointing main course, we then waited an hour for any signs of the pre ordered desserts. there were only 2 Staff on duty in an increasingly busy pub. It seemed that despite having paid \u00a325.00 per head, we were definitely not a priority. Finally we gave up and came away not having had the dessert, mince pies or coffee. We did not make the balance of the payment due for these. All in all it was bitterly disappointing to the 12 of us who had looked forward to our Christmas celebration. None of us would recommend The Barley Mow to anyone else. The Landlady did not even apologise for the non existent service. Our daughter ( not a chef) could teach their chef how to make mouth watering crispy roast potatoes. All of us could teach him how to cook edible vegetables.

We went on \"burger night\" and this offers several types of burger and a free drink from a selection. We ordered a range of food.  Unfortunately, all the burgers came with bacon and cheese when two orders specifically requested no cheese.  I myself had gammon and egg, one of my eggs was more like an omelette and the gammon would be described as wafer thin ham rather than a gammon steak. I ordered herby potatoes but they weren't available, so I asked for a baked potato and although they were on the menu, they had none of those either so I was offered only chips. They were served with frozen peas.  A colleague ordered the chicken pie and herby potatoes, but again they only offered chips which she refused. The waiter said he would bring her extra veg, she got a double helping of the frozen peas and a few pieces of carrot. She actually ate only the crust of her pie which had obviously been cooked seperately from the rest of the pie as the chicken was crusty and the sauce just full of pepper. Another colleague specifically said that her club sandwich should be served without mayo. It came with mayo and had to be sent back.

Previously we went to the Barley Mow over the past three years as we live a measured 350 metres from it. We were very disappointed. Today, mother\u2019s day, the food was, like always, over cooked, especially the Yorkshire pudding was burnt to the point of charcoal. The baked potatoes were most definitely cooked in used oil and so hard that it could not be cut or forked. One of us ordered a beef roast and, after we sent the plates back to replace the Yorkshires, we discovered the beef was actually pork. We let that go because we are not there to make unnecessary trouble. The biscuit sticks that came with the ice cream were old and stale. Every time in the past your chips were burnt. Today for the second time in three months the bill was completely wrong. Your people are friendly and obviously want to help, but I dare say that maybe training might help (and the same thing might apply to you in terms of business management). Small, but irritating things like waiting too long for orders, not cleaning tables and having to queue at the bar to order each course on the menu is very annoying.

I saw the photos dated early 2012 of the garden (well maintained) and the inside of the pub (rather dark and drab) but as it was on the village green and it was a pleasant evening, it was worth a visit. However upon arrival, the inside of the pub looked like it had been refreshed; newly decorated bar, light coloured walls, varnished wood flooring and tables, new chairs, ceiling spot lights and stylish wall lights. The new menu had homemade dishes and the staff were buzzing with enthusiasm about it. We were shown a newly designed menu with some of the old favourites kept on and new dishes added to reflect the creative bubbly personality of the new landlady Sonia and newly appointed chef, Dan. It transpires that this pub came under new management at the end of March 2013. The pub had to be closed for 10 days due the amount of building work required to have it safe for trading. Having worked for a new start up business, and as with any new venture, it is expected that there will be teething problems that will be ironed out in good time, however the happy nature of the bar staff, lead by the new landlady (who has a zeal to provide only the best service to her customers) can put to rest any reservations, and that this pub is here to serve its community and visitors alike. My 1st visit, I decided to try the lasagne. It was homemade with locally supplied beef - freshly minced from steak (as are the burgers - oh don't get me started on the Moroccan Lamb Burgers which are to die for!!!). I couldn't eat a pudding due the size of the lasagne portion!! Make sure you don't eat anything filling at least 4 hours prior to ordering this!! Value for money is an understatement.  My 2nd visit, I ordered a Sunday Roast chicken (on recommendation of the landlady), which was a decent size, and then ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding - I found out that I'm not the only one who likes these - there was only 1 left - so I had it!! Gorgeously hot and sticky, I savoured every mouthful. On my 3rd visit, I had the Vegetarian Sunday Roast with Butternut squash with goats cheese (as recommended by a fellow diner). As a meat eater, I reluctantly tried this to at least give it a go. I was not disappointed. It was gorgeous!! I then ordered pudding - the Barley Mow mess - OMG - pre-order these as they sell like hot cakes!! My partner had the Roast Pork. The crackling was delicious and crispy and the plate was licked clean within a very short period of time!  My 4th visit, I tried a Moroccan Lamb burger, having seen it on the Specials Board. There were only 2 left. When it came out, I was not disappointed. It was accompanied with tzatziki and halloumi cheese, the homemade chips took me back to my childhood when potatoes were hand peeled and cut from scratch! The burger was well cooked and the spices were mouth-watering. Definitely a repeat order! I am truly surprised at the last 2 reviews; however when the bar is busy with customers waiting to be served and with only 2 people serving, patience must be exercised. Also bear in mind how experienced were the bar staff? We all had to start from somewhere - didn\u2019t you Battyw? Was the landlady advised of your disappointment with your brown bread 'snadwiches' and given the opportunity to put this right DavidC55? One of my hang ups are the lack of disabled toilets in pubs/restaurants. The building works in the garden is for such - a disabled toilet. This was not addressed by the previous landlords. Unfortunately if builders had the courtesy to treat other people's property like they would their own, there would not be any unsightly cigarette butts on the ground. The neglected garden was inherited from the previous landlords. The priority of the new landlady was to have the essential building works carried out first and then move her attention to garden. But as a Senior Reviewer, you will no doubt be willing to have the courtesy to revisit this pub and speak in person to the landlady to justify your shameful score. I on the other hand will continue to support this local village pub and give praise and constructive criticism for each visit, in person and on trip advisor. Keep up the good work Barley Mow - your village needs you!!!", "date_of_review": "21 July 2013"}

I have eaten in this pub for years now and the food has alway been impecable no matter what you ordered and the service was second to none.

We visited on a Sunday lunch time which should have been heaving as it used to be but it was very quite. I was amazed because I was expecting not to get a table.  I ordered two brown bread snadwiches, one prawn and one chicken mayo and a bowl of chips, but what arrived was two Baguettes. ~We were starving so we said not to worry when the guy offered to change them. The bread was very dry and there must have been a small spoonfull of filling in each one. The chips were lovely but what a shame. I asked if the place had changed hands and was told that it had. It seemed that the cheapest ingredients were used to maximise the profit margin and it showed. Sadley, we will never return to eat there again until it either get's it's act together or it changes hands. The last owners had the food spot on. All reviews are of course subjective but our meal really was terrible. The once lovely garden was also neglected with some building works going on but fag buts all over the place and the whole place just does not look like it's cared for.  I hope the owner / landlord takes this as constructive critisism because your pub can be a little goldmine but the food has to be A1 or you won't survive.", "date_of_review": "16 July 2013"}

The two student bar staff were very slow and at one point standing there chatting ignoring my partner who wanted to get served.  We sat in the beer garden,again empty on a summers night. As it was getting darker I asked the bar girl if she had any candles she said no.... Really not very helpful and made a story up about the neighbours complain if candles are lit, so if you decide to go remember to take a torch.  Really awful - I waited till all my guests had arrived and redirected them back to my house, cracked on the tunes, lit some candles and had the beer and wine flowing...

I won't be going back until I read some good reviews and being in the green I hear from word of mouth about places.

Unfortunately, when we placed the booking, they neglected to mention that the Englefield Green summer fair would be on that day. Queue arriving to find 100\u2019s of people milling around and no available parking. After driving down the back roads for a while we found a space on the roadside and then hiked back to the pub. On arrival at 1pm \u2013 the time we\u2019d booked, the bar staff told us they\u2019d given the table away \u2013 always a good start. However they did then pull some tables together to give us sufficient seating \u2013 although during the course of the meal, we were repeatedly bashed by the table behind as they got up and down. The food choice was normal pub fare \u2013 not particularly inspiring on the face of it. Ordering was relatively straight forward although we were lucky to get the one lady behind the bar who had a clue \u2013 more on that later. The food arrived and looked very appetising for 7 of the 8 orders \u2013 they\u2019d completely forgotten one of the meals - which turned up 5 minutes later. Having said that, the quality of the food was great \u2013 really tasty and pretty well presented. Being pub fare there was a mix of club sandwiches (enormous and tasty), Ham, egg and chips (very nice), salads and two children\u2019s meals plus the tardy but eventually extremely tasty lamb burger. And just to say \u2013 the best chips I\u2019ve had in a long time! After the plates were cleared away, more drinks and coffees plus ice cream were required, so I offered to go to the bar and order \u2013 20 minutes later I was served \u2013 there were two bar staff serving at this point with one of them a chap who appeared to be in reverse gear and had no clue about bar work. Bear in mind there must have been 10 or so customers waiting to be served, yet there were 3 or 4 young ladies clearing and cleaning, but just 2 \u2013 actually one and a third (see earlier point) people serving at the bar. Then when the coffee arrived (after another 20 minutes), it was just left on the bar and more to the point was Nescafe made with the kettle in the kitchen as the coffee machine had broken down. At least I assume that\u2019s what the 5 members of staff waving their arms around and pouring various contents into the top of the machine then waving their arms around again was all about! After that, we got the bill and made a swift exit. A real shame as their kitchen have obviously nailed the quality of food if not the tickets.

A nice, sensible range of interesting offerings on the menu. It came quickly and was nicely cooked. A nice range of real ales etc on offer and some nice house wine. Service was excellent and the staff nice and friendly. The fish and chips were as good as you can get anywhere as was the ham egg and chips. The Classic Aubergine with Parmesan was delicious and not too rich. We were nearly tempted by the special which was Moroccan Burger but the fish and chips were too much of a temptation for my Canadian relatives. Prices were reasonable and comparable with most country pubs. Good value at just over \u00a315 a head including two drinks each (except the driver!) In my student days I don't remember there even being a back garden. It now has several benches, with sun shades, on a lawn and is family friendly with a small children's play area at the bottom. The location is lovely with a big green in front of the pub and it's close to Virginia Water, Saville Gardens and (worth doing) head down a couple of back roads and you can walk to the Long Mile in Windsor Great Park. Runnymead, the Magna Carta Memorial, the Air Force Memorial and the Thames are all a few minutes drive away. They have recently taken over and are working hard to revamp the whole place.

HOWEVER, in saying that, I have been here quite often for a drink. They also do a great trivia night on a Sunday, which I would recommend (but you need to get their early for a table). Service isn't bad. Just a couple of young lads behind the bar which are always friendly enough. Thumbs up on the outside area as well on a sunny day.

Very pleasant surroundings and staff but the meal was disappointing. The meat was cooked to perfection - one duck leg & one lamb selection BUT the veg which you would imagine was the easy part was not. I personally did not feel the pea jus went with the lamb and the crushed potatoes were not crushed and browned - just cut up. If it was sold as boiled potatoes and carrots fair enough but to say crushed potatoes was not a fair description. I hope the pub takes note - if simple improvements could be made it would be worth a second visit but not as presented last Tuesday. The duck came with grilled lettuce - different but tasteless however the side portion of chips was good.", "date_of_review": "19 June 2015"}

After selecting a pint from the excellent range of guest ales, we settled for a table outside, making the most of some August sunshine - that rare thing this summer! We ordered the Italian charcuterie board to share \u2013 coppa, finocchona, salame vento, bra duro, olives and bread - all good, but a tiny bit on the small side if you are sharing. For the main we both had the 3 Roast selection, Chicken Leg, Beef cuts and Pork with stuffing. It came with all the trimmings, including a huge Yorskshire Pudding. It was a very good effort, though the beef was far too chewy. We shared a sticky toffee pudding, with vanilla ice cream for dessert, which was simply sublime.

The conversation was watched over by a man behind the bar who uncomfortably kept an eye on us (3 school mums) over the rest of the evening as we quietly supped our red wine without an accompanying nibbles.  A pub which is meant to have high food standards really shouldn't be providing tomato ketchup as a chutney to cheese, and for your profits, you are either paying your supplier way too much for your cheese or trying to make a greedy profit for a poor standard of cheeseboard. 3 school mums who will not be coming back to your pub and have already told a few others our story who have also been put off.

The highlight of the meal however was the absolutely delicious deserts - the souffl\u00e9s are to die for. worthy of particular mention is the welcoming staff and their friendly attentiveness to their customers.

But it seems too busy to cook the food long enough for it to be edible and enjoyable. Both my daughter and I had scallop starters..two small and one large, with slivers of crispy bacon and the most bizarre vanilla flavoured sauce. We both found the small ones were 'just' about cooked, another minute possibly and they would have been fine. The large ones were raw inside... I had wild boar sausages (delicious!) with mash (watery). My daughter had steak, (so raw it was almost walking off the plate, it turned my stomach) she sent it back to the kitchen to get it cooked. After much waiting, it came back burnt on one side and like leather. Suffice to say she didn't eat it, but had the 'pleasure' of paying \u00a319.50 for it. It came with a peppercorn sauce which also had the most weirdest of tastes, lemon/smoke combo? that also was discarded. All in all a very disappointing meal.", "date_of_review": "14 February 2016"}

Whilst the lure of scallops with vanilla celeriac pur\u00e9e sounded inviting, the (un)finished article was far from that. Whilst the smaller scallops were just about done the largest one still had a glistening raw centre.  Ok, I thought, I'll let them off that one because the scallops that were cooked were good. Next, I ordered a medium rare 28 day aged Angus steak with peppercorn sauce. Sounded delicious. What I got on my plate was the roughest looking bit of steak I'd ever seen and I'm surprised it didn't walk off my plate and start mooing it was so underdone. Definitely not medium rare, more like \"Are we sure it's still not alive\"?! The waitress took it back and it came back medium rare, but still a rubbish bit of meat.  The peppercorn sauce was just...well....bizarre! Since when were lemons the basis of a peppercorn sauce?! It was so lemony it was inedible. Just a bit weird. I was really looking forward to this meal as I like the pub itself and regularly visit for drinks and maybe a Sunday roast. This meal however was a huge disappointment and left me still feeling hungry as I could barely eat what was given to me. Just drinks next time I think :(.", "date_of_review": "14 February 2016"}

Also it's a shame the yummy mummy's of Ealing could not keep their various offspring under control, the screams of said children echoed round the pub, the garden and probably half way to Acton!!!!!  However the food more than made up for said gripes, it was in one word heavenly!!! My starter of stuffed courgette flowers was so good that I just wanted to keep eating, with the hazelnuts and honey complementing the fresh vegetable perfectly. My stuffed tortellini was equally as good, with loads of fresh flavours and was very rich with lovely tasting pasta.  My partner was equally impressed with his squid and then wood pigeon.

Pub wasn\u2019t that busy, seen it busier but the staff are running around like headless chickens and don\u2019t seem to know what they are doing, the outside tables are covered with glasses and empty plates which seem to sit there for quite a while. I waited a good 10 minutes to be served at the bar even though there was only one person in front of me. Second time I went to order some drinks, the bar was empty, 3 people came in after me and all got served first, even after I said I was here first!!! Wanted to order some puddings but gave up waiting and came out. Really annoying and very disappointed, such a shame because it could be such a lovely pub if only the staff were on the ball.

One cocktail one beer 2 cokes a coffee and a port .Bill \u00a3143 with included tip. Service from the staff was excellent .Fish soup was tasty came with cheese croutons and rouille.Clearly the rouille is not Raymond Blancs recipe .It was yellow and basically tasted like mustard mayo.No sign of cayenne or saffron.The chicken dish was fine .The filket steak was cooked as requested and perfect.It came with bernaise and a piece of butter on top of it.I assume this buttwr should be melting but it was too cold and after eating the food was still in a lump.The chips were not home made and very much looked and tasted like Mcains skin on fries.The pork dish was ok but was advertised as with crackling.There was not one piece on the plate.Lastly and worst of all was the cheeseboard.The cheese was fine but the crackers consisted of thinly sliced baguette of bread and some attempt to toast it.The homemade chutney was tasteless and tasted like apple sauce with mustard seeds in.Not worth anywhere near the \u00a38 and Bistro Pierres cheeseboard often included in their set meals is way better and on its own \u00a32 cheaper. I think they need to get someone inspecting the food before it goes out and checking the items against the menu.Its a nice place in a nice location but we expected much better from this chain in the Blanc empire . A couple of things not available on the menu which didnt matter as we woudnt have ordered them.Lastly they have a little bread station on the left as you go downstairs into the eating area of the pub .The butter for this bread had been left in an open wrapper in full view of guests on a ledge at the side of the baguette cutting station.It was never moved and just seemed odd and not making a great impression.", "date_of_review": "19 September 2018"}

After they did it the first time we specifically said NOT to drown the drink with Coke yet they managed to do the same again. It's almost like you feel obliged to order another shot or were they doing this so people would refuse the drinks and the staff would get to drink them themselves? If it had happened once, I'd let them off but it happened ALL evening so was very annoying.  The toilets didn't seem to be checked during the evening which always makes me feel uncomfortable about a pub. Seeing as this one closes at 11pm, which is quite early compared to other pubs in the area, I'd have expected tables to be cleared of plates and glasses more often and toilets to actually be checked during the evening.

We had booked this using a virgin experience voucher, so the menu was obviously limited. Chose the Steak Frites 'express'. Express being the right word as the food was served roughly 5 minutes after our bread and oil came out for starter!. Nonetheless, the steak was cooked nicely and would recommend this from the normal menu. Puddings were not so great, my pear tart was very nice but my wife's apple crumble was literally just stewed apples with crumble mix sprinkled on the top. No apple sauce so very dry and hard to eat.  That said, eating here on a voucher is somewhat restrictive, the normal menu looked great and apart from the apple crumble the food was good enough to make me want to go back and experience it properly.

My partner ate veal Escallops Vitello in marsala sauce with steamed vegetables. To complete the meal we ordered a pitcher of sangria (\u00a321.95) which took the total bill, with an Affogato to finish, to around \u00a340 each including a service charge for our waitress Ornela, who was managing all three occupied tables on her own.

When we arrived at 8.45pm we were seated almost immediately which was good as we were a party of nine,our drinks were ordered and arrived very quickly,then we were given venues and proceeded to order,that's when it all became calamity two of my party ordered buyers but were told they had ran out,so chose the chicken salad,one ordered mussels,two ordered fish and chips,one Gammon and eggs,two tagine and then the last guest who arrived ten minutes later ordered fish and chips. The first fish and chips came out after roughly 15 minutes and was given to the last person who ordered...very strange but also funny,then five minutes later t we the mussels came followed by two fish,the fish was very dark in colour and had been over fried,we asked how much longer the rest of the food was going to be as the first person had nearly finished ..we got no update from the waitress who just seemed to be avoiding us,after about another half hour we asked to see the manager as we still hadn't had anymore food,after dealing with another customer complaint she came over to find out what our problem was,we explained how bad the service was and explained that three members of the party had eaten and the rest of us hadn't,she said she would find out from the kitchen and get back to us, ten minutes later the food started coming out in dribs and drabs and was luke warm ,the chicken salad arrived and looked nothing like the picture,and was under cooked,the tagline arrived five minutes later and was sparse and lacking flavour,all this time the manager was standing next to us looking at the food in disgust,the Gammon never arrived and that was the final straw after having to wait over an hour for nine mains to come out on time and together we had enough and decided to leave . There was an offer of drinks on the house which we declined,in all my years in I have never had to complain about a meal,but this was atrocious and how the chefs in the kitchen can call themselves chefs God only knows,smart brasserie on the outside shocking on the inside and the highlight of our evening were the chips we had to get from the chippy in egham", "date_of_review": "24 June 2019"}

Lot\u2019s of positives: good location on the Green;mainly nice and light and airy inside , but also with some cosier corners and a pleasant garden area. Friendly welcome from member of staff. Choice of 4 hand pulled ales at a reasonable price. My customer had the special Burger of the day . Came with quite a few add ons & chips and he enjoyed it . I hope he did because it cost \u00a319 for a lunchtime burger! However it was better value than my roasted salmon , which was the smallest piece of salmon I have ever seen . To be fair would have been OK as part of a starter, but as a main course it was a joke . I was glad I asked for chips rather than salad, although that was all it came with , apart from half a lemon. Probably to avoid embarrassment, it was served on a half size plate but it still looked a bit pathetic .  So a mini portion of salmon , some sauce , a medium sized portion of what seemed like frozen chips and a lemon . \u00a315 I rest my case !", "date_of_review": "26 August 2019"}

The food was good, the service was friendly and you get a great view over Bushy Park.  We ordered the garlic bread and then risotto and penne roso verde and a glass of the sangiovese and the tiramisu.  The garlic bread was the only poor part of the whole experience. It was doughy and either under proved or more likely under cooked.  The risotto was quality. My wife and I cook a pretty decent risotto at home and mostly the ones we have out are a disappointment. This one wasn\u2019t, full of flavour with earthy mushrooms including girolles and porcini with peas to cut through the creaminess.  I was not convinced at the start by the sangiovese but it really grew on me and went well with the risotto. For a house wine it was right up there on flavours but it's a grower.  The pasta was really tasty. Well cooked and the ingredients had been brought together to create this lovely well balanced sauce with a meaty sauce and the chorizo really stood out.  We finished with the tiramisu which was light as a feather with just the right amount of coffee flavour.  It is a little more expensive than every other Italian in the area but you can see where the money goes in terms of location and flavour. With the exception of the garlic bread I would highly recommend a visit. ", "date_of_review": "11 January 2019"}

A Negroni was waiting for me courtesy of my friend: and very good it was too. In fact the bar and wine list scored highly all evening, as did the service. A bottle of Valpollicella was really excellent with wonderful length and the cognacs we finished with were a bargain at \u00a36.50 each for a restaurant price. Staff were uniformly efficient, helpful and polite. But the food was the let-down. My friend's four stuffed mushrooms received the thumbs up; although the accompanying salad was proclaimed a let down. My mussels were simply salty with no flavour of the white wine which was supposed to form the sauce. They didn't inspire. La Fiamma says that its pizza and pasta are all home made. I can't dispute this. I can only say that my quattro stagione pizza was perfectly circular with a remarkably neat edge and with a perfect circle of tomato sauce within it. The toppings were remarkably evenly spaced and the whole thing was nearly completely flat. It didn't inspire or taste at all fresh. Draw your own conclusions. We were both impressed with a menu which listed 8 risottos. Risotto is a good sign in an Italian restaurant as it takes a lot of skill and effort to make well. But the seafood risotto that arrived was truly appalling. It may well have been made with 'Italian rice' as advertised. But it wasn't a risotto rice. Instead a pile of long grain rice and seafood sat in the middle of a pond of rather thin seafood sauce which had not been absorbed into the rice. To add insult to injury, my friend was ill that night. Dessert was a house special of vanilla ice-cream with crushed amaretti and a shot of amaretto liqueur was really excellent; but not rocket science. The ambience was good, the staff very good, the bar was good but the food was pretty awful. We both live locally but neither of us will return.", "date_of_review": "12 January 2019"}

SHOCKED BY CHEF ATTITUDE!", "comment": "I visited la Fiama last week as I was curious of the changes since it was refurbished so wanted to see how it compared with previous visits. All of the food was nice and generally happy other than finding a shard of bone in a chicken breast. The chicken breast had been wrapped in Parma ham so this was not visible and a bit surprised when chewing to find what it was. I wasn\u2019t really that bothered as I\u2019m not one to complain but my partner said you should mention something to the waitress when collecting our plates which I did. The waitress went the the kitchen and came back after speaking to the chef who had said that it was a conective piece of tissue which I could relate to as there was a small amount of grissle which I had noticed but was not what I was referring to. After a little deliberation I brought the matter up again as I didn\u2019t feel they had accnowled what I had told them and brought the matter up again. I noticed annother senior looking chef who was sitting in the corner of the restaurant who could obviously hear the conversation as we were the only people in the restaurant at the time and decided to come over and give his opinion on the matter. He brought a prepared chicken breast from the kitchen showing me a large connective bone which was apparent with the example he was showing me but did not come out on my plate as so. He was adamant this was the only bone that I could have been talking about but was nothing like the small sharp shard I was referring to. I was all a bit taken back as to how they reacted in complete denial as to something I was only making them aware of. I told them to bring my plate back so I could show them the evidence which they failed to do so when asked other than continually getting told this is not possible. They affectively were calling me a liar and felt it was a complete let down to what was a fairly tasty meal. I don\u2019t think we would have been spoken to in this manner if we weren\u2019t the only customers in the restaurant. We won\u2019t be coming back ever again.

Never ever ever have I been served pasta in foil. The waitresses were absolutely charming.

The restaurant is attached to the rear of the pub, is comfortable and contemporary. The staff are very welcoming on arrival and service is professional . On past occasions I have been to dinner midweek which has been busy but not too busy. The menu has been quite varied and the food very good. Try the Camembert cheese with chutney and fresh bread or the fish platter are excellent. Or pate if you prefer! For main course there are a few treats but noticeably calves liver which was really good. On this occasion it was Sunday luncheon with a set menu with a shortened menu including some of the above favourites plus Sunday Roasts. A quality Sunday luncheon well presented, ample portions and good service and value for money. A fish dish and the belly of pork were offered that were very well received. Summarising _ highly recommended , quality restaurant for informal family/ couple occasions. Try it you wont be disappointed!", "date_of_review": "12 December 2016"}

I eventually had to leave the table and ask at the bar for the bill. When it arrived it had the service included and 'SERVICE NOT INCLUDED' crossed out on the bill. I suspect they did this because they knew the service was poor. I may investigate having the service refunded from my \u00a3120 bill. The food was reasonable but not the best pizza for an Italian restaurant. Considering the way the waiting staff over fuss as they dress the table when you arrive, you would think they would be more attentive when plates need clearing, deserts ordering and the bill delivered. I would probably have left a below average tip of around \u00a310 because of the poor service but because they made it compulsory I am seriously considering using the 2015 consumer rights act to get a refund!

My wife's pizza was so overcooked it was difficult to cut. My small lasagne seemed to be missing the meat and pasta content and my overwhelming impression was that it mostly comprised of a rather thin tomato sauce with one layer of topping. We skipped dessert. We were with friends so we soldered on, paid the bill and left without speaking to the management.

We have eaten the bar food a lot more often than that and it never disappoints. We probably go in for drinks about twice a week and have a happy hour cocktail on our way back from the Sainsbury's shop on a Friday. Sorry to sound mundane but the only time we would use the car park is when we are having one drink, and usually we can get a space. What I have found really impressive is that the core bar staff are the same after all these years! I can only assume from this that the owners are good employers. We chat to the bar staff and the owners when we see them and I think they all do a really good job and have made the place what it is.

The roasted garlic that accompanied it was sweet and a perfect combination with the mild, creamy, tasty cheese. Plentiful portion to share - delicious. For mains we decided upon the fish pie and the steak and ale pie. If like me you enjoy only a little pastry then you will love the the latter. The steak and ale pie was a delight, cooked to perfection and again the portion plentiful, it was like the never ending pie. Triple cooked chips yummy too. My daughter said her fish pie was very tasty and again plenty of fish within it. For dessert we could only manage coffee. We also had 4 alcoholic beverages between us and the whole meal came to \u00a352. Well worth a visit if you like posh pub grub.

We all ordered roast, I had the pork belly roast and my friends had the roast beef. The portion size was small with the veg allocation being one slice of carrots, one broccoli stem and a spoonful of braised cabbage per plate.  The pork belly seemed really quickly cooked as none of the fat had rendered down and there was no tasty meat attached too it, just rubbery inedible fat.  The beef looked a lot better but came with some small pieces of string the perfect size for chocking hidden within the beef.  The Yorkshire puddings looked impressive but were very greasy.  The service from the bar was good but requests to the food server for additional veg and sauce were left unheeded.  Overall I didn't rate it and won't be going back for the roast!

The waitress service was attentive, friendly and drinks and food arrived reasonably quickly despite the restaurant gradually filling up. The food was tasty and portions just enough. My roast beef (medium rare) was tasty. Veggies lovely, esp the red cabbage. Roast potatoes? Not bad, but never as good as home made, are they? ? Cappuccinos to follow were tasty and hot.

Got lucky with the parking so mother didn't have to walk that far. Real buzzy atmosphere was the first impression which is great. Table was to the right as we came in the main entrance which was close to the back entrance to the car-park. The staff were friendly and efficient, the time between courses was about right too. All the food was of good quality and large portions, really could not say anything negative about our choices. Even the 'roasts' were extremely good, which, for me, is a positive sign as normally restaurant/pub roasts are always disappointing. And such good value as well. Overall this was a very successful sunday afternoon family meal and we would come back. Only slight negative was that where we were seated was right next to the back door, so we had to put up with the comings and goings through this entrance on a coldish day and we did feel like we were sitting in the car-park as there is nothing, no blinds/curtains on the back windows, to block our view of the unattractive rear area to the pub.", "date_of_review": "18 February 2014"}

It has recently re-opened after a facelift and a change of name, used to be Midas Touch, although I think the management is still the same. We went there a few times, were never that impressed but decided to try it again in its new incarnation. We were hoping that it would be a suitable venue for my husband's 60th birthday celebration dinner early next year, but we were very disappointed. I didn't find the menu very inspiring. The starter menu in particular is dominated by fish and seafood. I had the soup of the day, carrot and coriander, but it was peculiarly tasteless, even with lots of salt and pepper added, I only managed half of it but no comment was made when the dishes were taken away. My husband had squid and my friends had stilton & garlic mushrooms, which they said were OK. For my main course I had lamb steak, it came with dauphinoise potatoes and a runny pea, leek and mint pur\u00e9e, like a green gravy! There were no vegetables, so I ordered a green salad, which was very small and consisted almost entirely of lamb's lettuce, with some rocket and a few green beans, it had far too much salad dressing. It should be served separately. That was \u00a33 extra. For \u00a313 I wouldn't expect some vegetables to be included. Service was good, food was OK, but unexciting and overpriced. Drinks were very expensive. There were only 3 white wines by the glass, two around \u00a36 for 250 ml, one over \u00a37. I asked why there weren't more wines by the glass and the waitress said it was because when they did used to offer more no-one wanted them! But I guess there must be more choice at the bar, and if so why not in the restaurant?

But, when ordering pork for a Sunday roast you\u2019d expect a crunchy bit of cracking. Very disappointing that this wasn\u2019t present, the potatoes felt like they had been sitting in a hot oven 20 mins too long they were leathery/rock solid. And don\u2019t get me started on the abomination of the Yorkshire pudding!!!! Good grief it was a savoury sponge cake. The Apple sauce was baby food consistency. Really should\u2019ve gone for bog standard Apple sauce out of a jar, would\u2019ve been far better. As for the lamb, it was very overdone, and the trimmings presented the same problems as the pork roast, however the mint sauce was not so bad.  I say the service was quite good, because when they were made aware of the bad food, they did offer to rectify their shortcomings on the food, but by that time we weren\u2019t really interested in additional food so they took 20% off the mains.  It\u2019s a shame because the pub is a nice venue and the service is generally good but the food was a massive let down.", "date_of_review": "26 May 2019"}

The seating area is behind that, or downstairs. On the ground floor the seating area is cosy, and pleasant to sit in. The menu is fairly large with the usual Turkish meze and grilled meat dishes. Specialities like seftali are not here, but plenty of favourites are.  What separates this restaurant from many in the area is the use of real charcoal, which flavours the meat in the right way, and of course any sundries that get grilled.  The meat is very good quality and when you sit in, kebabs are served with rice and salad.  I recommend the beyti, or any of the yogurtlu dishes. But you cannot go wrong with their Adana, chicken or lamb sis if you have plainer tastes.  I am a Turk, and very fussy with kebab restaurants in London. This place has me coming back to frequently. When I lived in the area, a takeaway chicken sis was my preferred option, served in a large wrap.  Prices are good for the area. Thoroughly recommend. ", "date_of_review": "11 April 2016"}

Hidden at the back of the kebab takeaway, this is a proper hidden gem. Coming here is like being on holiday. There is always a queue of people waiting for takeaway - it's a sign of how good the food is. Make your way through to the back and Sinan and the team are always ready with a friendly welcome. There's plenty of choice. We recommend the whitebait, patlican kizartma (aubergine) & karides grill. The tuna steak is always wonderfully marinated meaning it's tender and tasty. The grill gives a wonderful flavour to all meats. Regular favourites are Pirzola (lamb chops) and Adana kofta. Everything is very fresh and we love the salads. And the pomegranate onions are a treat if you are lucky enough to be given them. It's always a happy day when we know we are coming here. ", "date_of_review": "4 March 2016"}

The lady (forgot to take her name, but manageress I think) who organised the evening had everything running smoothly and professionally and also added a lovely personal touch with thistles on every table and a lovely informal and professional atmosphere. Everything was deleivered with such understated class. She introduced us all to the new chef and he intorduced each course for us which gave it a real sense of occasion. The chef blew us away with his skills, we felt like we were on an episode of Master chef the professionals ! Every ingredient and element was cooked to perfection. There was even a wonderfully enthusiastic young actor who beautifully narrated one of Burn's poems and really brought it to life. It was a wonderful touch of theater.

The whitebait is as good as it gets, the tuna is amazing, all the veg starters are great and every dish comes with an amazing salad - the exact opposite of that type of British cuisine where salad is 'the trimmings' or even a chore to get through. My highly carnivorous wife loves it even more than I do! They do amazingly well with a tiny kitchen and not very large seating area but it never feels uncomfortable or oppressive. The custom is the most diverse I've seen, in that no one age, gender or background dominates and there's always a nice buzz about the place. You could go there for a romantic dinner for 2, with a bunch of mates or with the whole family, and be equally pleased.

What we got was almost the best meal ever Upon arrival I was let down by the appearance : the chips were not typical chippy chips (i.e. big chunky chips) but rather fries and the \"fish\" was two smallish looking portions rather than one made to look like a big fillet of fish like many vegan places do. However, once we cut in it was almost the best meal I have ever had.  The chef here is a genius. The tofu was wrapped in not only Nori, but also samphire and lots of it. The batter around it was delicious and the accompanying vegan tartare sauce and the minted pea puree : OH MY GOD!!!!! this was so good I dare say it tasted like it also had fenugreek in the pea puree but i may be wrong. Maybe parsley? Whatever it was it was delicious. Even the chips were great - nothing like chippy chips but very very good fries with skin on and crispy too.  The only fault I can find is that the chef had used silken tofu which is far far too soft and slightly ruined the overall texture.  Had they used a firm tofu this would have been one of the best meals I have ever had in my 37 years.  I really commend the chef here and just hope they will start to use firm tofu and not change a single other thing about this dish  Great music and now great vegan food too.  This is one of my favourite venues in the country and I just wished i lived closer! Please could you guys start doing some vegan desserts too??? Many thanks A big fan", "date_of_review": "28 October 2019"}

Bad idea to start so optimistically. As this is to be my first review a mate suggested that we try this place as it has a heck of a lot of first reviews.  (I also see that management do not exactly shine under criticism so they may want to stop reading just about now) Unlike those reviews I am not here to big up the staff. I would if I could but the service was just about ok and I better move on before I rethink that. We were just going to grab a pint as I had started to check the reviews as we sat down. Then the weather turned so we had lunch. Something else to blame on the weather. Between us we tried the double burger and the gammon. What could possibly go wrong? All I will say about the burger is that I had a MaccyDs the next day and it was ten times better and under half the price with a free drink.. The gammon was dry and very chewy. It really should have come with a steak knife. We both exited lunch agreeing that we deserved a really nice dinner to make up for it but in the meantime we needed some crisps to survive. Initially I could not quite figure out how this place was in the top local 40 places to eat until I was shown how to weed out the first time reviewers. Now TA makes much more sense. If this place was not in the nice situation it is in by the river it may struggle to stay open. This is a drinks place and it is fine for that.

I have frequented this restaurant at the slightest feeling of being peckish. It is a wonderful place, with the front being take away and the back being the restaurant.  The food is cooked fresh in front of you (kebabs), over the charcoal grill. They are some of the best kebabs I've ever tasted! I love them!  And if you want something more refined, then just go into the restaurant, which is very class, and very nice.  Staff are also incredibly friendly- so much so that they remember faces and names, and will always converse, even when they are very busy!  Prices are excellent- at \u00a37 with rice or \u00a35/\u00a36 normally- I'm more than happy to pay that for the well cooked and tasty meals I'm having!", "date_of_review": "21 February 2013"}

Being fans of Lebanese and Greek restaurants, we had comparisons in mind!  We were greeted very warmly and the waiter was superb throughout our meal. Very attentive, helpful and regularly refilled our bread basket!  We ordered 3 starters to share; humus, cheese filled pastries and falafel- all really nice. The cheese filled pastys were definitely a favourite-hot, freshly cooked, and very flavoursome! Then for mains we ordered spicey minced lamb kababs which came with a lovely, big mixed salad and rice and also a lamb kleftiko. Both were again very enjoyable, the lamb in the kleftiko was perfectly cooked- fell off the bone- really tasty! Overall our experience was really good, Great food, great service and very good value for money. It isnt exactly the most glamorous of restaurants; seating is fairly tightly packed and the outside does put you off a little (from the outside it just looks like a takeaway). However, the food really was tasty and the service was excellent. Would definitely recommend for a good Turkish meal if in the area! And just a quick note... it looks nothing like the profile picture on here!!! Much smaller and a bit less grand!", "date_of_review": "3 April 2013"}

The topping on both pizzas was - to put it mildly - meagre, with the tomato on the Marguerita spread very thinly and looking as though it had been scraped off again round the edges. The mushroom and cheese pizza was \u00a32 more than the other pizzas, which we assumed was for the mushrooms; but there were very few of these. The fries didn't arrived till 13 minutes after the pizzas, which were at least half eaten by then, and only after we had reminded staff twice and I was on my way in to the pub to ask where they were.

We'd been to the Boaters previously a year ago to eat, and for drinks since, and remembered it as a fun with good food and a great view. How it has changed! Loud, blaring bass music greeted us, so much so that we could hardly hear our waiter initially (this was lowered). The waiter was so laid back it could be described as sloppy, but the food was worse. The starters were just passable (but not great) as was the one portion of fish and chips ordered. Three mains selections were unavailable, so we ended up choosing three portions of flat-iron chicken. When they arrived we couldn't believe that a chef had actually thought the food was presentable enough to leave the kitchen. All portions looked like big pieces of raw fish, sloppy grey skin and very cheap-looking cuts of chicken. When I made the more senior person there aware of my view he actually asked how I would cook flat-iron chicken! The rosemary-salted chips were anything but that and when we asked for what was actually on the menu, we were brought a separate dish of rosemary salt, which the waiter then accidentally dropped all over the table. He brought another dish but made no attempt to clear the salt-laden table so we ate surrounded by the stuff. We didn't eat much of the chicken but the cat did quite well out of it as we wrapped chicken up in paper tissues for him! The waiter thought that was funny. I know we should have sent our meals it back, but as it was mum's treat we tried to make light. My mum paid the bill before I saw it, so I didn't get chance to deduct the 12.5% service charge before I saw it (nearly \u00a320). As we were leaving, I told the more senior person that we were very unhappy and questioned the service charge for a pub meal. I was told that the Boaters is \"technically a restaurant\" and as such charged for service - well you could've fooled me. Such a shame, it was really good a couple of years ago. As we left at 9pm, there were just two tables of people eating, which unfortunately says it all. I suggest a paddle upstream to the Mute Swan in Hampton Court to see how it should be done.", "date_of_review": "9 May 2019"}

It was then that I first saw this palce as I drove passed and made a mental note as it looked good from the outside and the smell was even better. Well 2 years late and I was comign back past Hammersmith on Saturday and decided I would take the opportunity to stop and get a taekaway. GIven I live quite far away and am not suaully in that kneck of the woods I thought what the hell, tiem to try it out. I was praying that it was as good as I remember it looking and smelling lol. I did a bit of research on the place to make sure it was not really bad and to my delight the reviews I had found were positive. Now, as this place is quite far from me I thought I would take advantage now that I was here and order a few different things off the menu to judge the place upon as that is usually what I do when trying out a new place. The restrauant is small but theres a decent amount of tables and seems to have a healthy amount of people sitting in to eat as well as getting a takeout. One cool thing which I like to see is that they have a perspex panel infront of the BBQ upon which they cook all the grilled food and so you can see all the food being made infront of you when ordering a takeaway. I',m a bit of a kebab veteran so I all ready knew what I wanted but had a quick scan of the menu anyway. They seemed to sell all teh usual Turkish/arabic style menu items so you won;t be short of choice. I decided to go with a Large Lamb Kofta, Small Chicken Shish, 1 portion of Wings and Small chips ( i have a weak spot for chips lol). The Wings were ok, tbh they wer'nt naythign to write hoem about, woudl say they were just average. The Lamb Kofta was nice, there was plenty of salad put into my wrap and the lamb itself was well seasoned. There was a bit mroe fat then i'm used to in the meat but overall the wrap tasted good and I would have it again. The Chicken Shish or Shish Taouk as its sometimes called was also good and tasty and the mixture of chilli and garlic sauce which I had complemented it well. The chilli sauce used is a little bit unusual comapred to what you would normally get, in that it had chucks of tomato and chilli in it rather than jsut being a purely smooth watery chilli sauce. It was nice enough, not the best i;ve had, not the worst, but it was good overall. The chips were very nice and had a unique taste to them which made them more tasty than your average fries.

The Fish and chips was very good and substantial, my steak was slightly overdone but still tasty. We were served by a brunette with a Northern accent and the service was prompt and efficient (Sorry I\u2019m terrible at remembering names and even worse at placing accents).

There were only a few customers. Eventually the waiter found some menus. When we then ordered we were told that two of the mains were off the menu. (Why not say that at the start). Our drinks were served promptly and we waited for our food - and waited and waited. The restaurant at this time was getting quite busy but other people were served before us. The food was extremely ordinary. The flatiron steaks were very tough - yes I know they are a little tough and have a qrissly membrane but they had no flavour. The normal fish and chips came with the fish barely cooked. The veggie \"fish\" consisted of two great battered lumps, cold in the middle. The starters were quite reasonable. I had quail (\u00a39), beautifully dressed and cooked + a few tomato slices. Had it been Claridges fine, but not \u00a39 at a riverside pub. The general conclusion is that the Boaters will feed you, but it is expensive.  When we were asked if the food was ok there was silence. We could not challenge the 12.5% service charge as we were paying and this would have embarrassed our friends even more than the food.", "date_of_review": "17 September 2018"}

We were served by a charismatic young man called Joe who was very helpful and had a great knowledge of the beers! We stayed and had some lunch in the large garden. The food was absolutely delicious!

My friend who has never been before was left speechless by the beauty of the views of the Thames from the venues elevated balcony. A truly stunning location. Only minor flaws, nothing worthy of losing a star but points for improvement, firstly I would have liked the spectacled chap on the bar to pay attention when I order my drinks because I would actually like what I asked for, secondly the mac & cheese, Parmesan is a lovly cheese but in a mac n cheese it\u2019s a waste of time, I get that the chefs want to look cool using nice ingredients but what you\u2019ve made is just a white sauce with pasta, seriously it\u2019s disgusting, use a real cheese, like cheddar, it has flavour.  But what do I know I was only a chef for about 9 years.... The fries were also stone cold when they were brought out, luckily the young chap named Scott who appeared to be running the show fixed the issue instantly without hesitation or complaint, most professional.  When it came time to pay the bill I was served by a rather beautiful & charming young man called Ned who genuinely made us feel appreciated as customers as he waved us a good honest goodbye.  Yes I would go the boaters again, if I could I\u2019d move into the balcony & lay there watching the river everyday. ", "date_of_review": "15 August 2018"}

The pub itself is beautiful and sits right on the river. The bar is vibrant and I would definitely go back for drinks.Unfortunately the food was terrible and over priced. The chicken was inedible and swimming in butter and tasted off. This was after waiting abosultely ages for our food. When we ordered dessert, we waited a good 15mins before someone came round and asked us if we wanted dessert and we had to order again as our order wasn\u2019t placed. When the dessert came out the ice cream was mealted and it was so small for the price. Whilst we were waiting, we witnessed the waitress drop a plate of bread all over a gentleman\u2019s lap. The worrying thing was she then picked it off his lap, put it back on the tray and served it to someone else on the other side of their table. One of our party complained and to be fair the manager was very good, and she did not charge for the chicken and one of the desserts. She explained they were short staffed and it was clear that was the case. It was also evident the staff were not very well trained. The manager handled our complaints very well and for that reason I would go back for drinks but not to eat as I cannot believe any chef would send out a meal that bad. I actually felt ill later that night from eating half of the chicken!", "date_of_review": "10 June 2018"}

While the pub is quite large, the restaurant area only comprises of about 8 tables, and was seemingly attended only by one very inexperienced waitress, plus two other who came to help intermittently.  We were seated and given food menus, and then left there for at least 30' before anyone came to get our orders. Then the waitress asked me which sauce I wanted with my steak, and when I asked what the choices were I was told that they only had peppercorn sauce (why asking the question then?!). After this, she had to scramble to get us the drinks menu and find out what beers were available from the bar - didn't seem like such a difficult question?!  A few minutes after we placed our order, the flustered waitress came back and apologised to me because they had run out of chicken. I pointed out that I'd ordered the steak. She blushed more and apologised again. I was left there wondering if they were really planning to serve me chicken with peppercorn sauce. Once the starters came (mackerel pate & croquettes), we asked for some plates and a portion of break so we could share them. After quite some time, she came back with one plate only and one slice of slightly burnt toast. The food was alright though, so we had optimistic expectations for the mains, unfortunately my steak was tough and overcooked, and - guess what? - it came with bernaise sauce! Not to mention I did not get a steak knife or anything.The other dishes (mussels and lamb chops) were better. Finally, after another 20' trying to get somebody's attention to get the bill, we asked to split the bill on two cards: \u00a330 on one and the rest on the other. Waitress goes into panic, calls manager, they scramble around the till, finally she comes back and she announces that the best she can do for us is to put \u00a332 on one card and the rest on the other one. That was the last straw - we asked for the 12.5% service charge to be removed from our bill. Avoid like the plague.", "date_of_review": "3 June 2018"}

The booking process was easy, I requested a nice table overlooking the river and got one. The view of the river was lovely, the evening sun even coming out for us.  Our waitress was Connie who was very attentive and helpful with gluten-free requests and also delightfully clumsy (not with food or drink for which she is a safe pair of hands - but she certainly bumped into an empty chair or two) As someone equally clumsy, I immediately sympathised.  The food was of a reasonable standard, but the bill was surprisingly heavy for what we had. Reading a few other comments on tripadvisor, the management at the Boaters has a clear choice. Offer standard pub food like this for a more reasonable price in exchange for filling more tables or up their game and make the food something more special.

My dish was the linguine which was delicious to the last forkful.  The last time we were at the Boaters was over five years ago and we did not return as we thought it relied on its superb position next to the river to dole out quite pedestrian food.  No more! There has been a change of management and now it is a real foodie place in fantastic surroundings by the river.  True, we were spoilt a little as we on an were early walk and so managed to get onto the outside, narrow patio/balcony overlooking the dinghies pirouetting around each other on a brilliant sunshine drenched river.  That area is first-come- first-served andcso it was mere luck we happened on a vacancy as all the inside river view tables were booked on that May Bank Holiday (One thing, the stool chairs could do with cushions....) Special mention for Courtney who could not have been more helpful as it was supposed to be go-to-the-bar service but she ignored this and really looked after us.

For all those years we\u2019ve been meeting for a drinks on the \u201cquiet sunset balcony\u201d (see website), our feet at the river\u2019s edge, in the company of other locals.  We\u2019ve had countless Mother\u2019s Days with neighbours, Birthday dos, New Years Eves, Xmas Karaokes and Boxing Day brunches at the Boaters\u2019s. We\u2019ve attended the Tasting evenings and on more than one occasion, my husband has taken 20 work colleagues and spent hundreds of pounds in one evening.  We cheered David Walliams swimming past and waved to the Queen in Gloriana from that balcony. So, over time we\u2019ve probably actually paid for those familiar wooden boards and railings.  We\u2019ve withstood all the changes of management and fluctuating standards; virtually the whole pub being taken over for dining and one not being able to sit down for a drink as a result; the bevested tattooed hordes, plastic cups and long waits at the bar on weekends such as this; the grazed ankle bones as kids whizz through on scooters and climb on the stools to dribble and pant on the bar.  (Both our offspring in fact have worked there as students.) On bleak February evenings when the place is empty, it\u2019s us who still faithfully appear every week.  Why then, on this lovely Friday evening, were we set upon by security and asked to leave?  Yes, two local pensioners, with their first and in this case, only pint of beer and white wine, thrown off their regular spot on a half empty balcony.  It\u2019s because you have now decided it\u2019s for diners only. So an area that would normally be packed out with happy (and free spending) drinkers, many of them locals, was virtually deserted save for six people. (See photo)  You didn\u2019t even have the decency or amiability to come and talk to us yourself, but sent a bouncer! He was, in fact, charming and empathetic as we have become familiar to him over the years and so, he \u201callowed\u201d us to finish our drinks, \u201cbut next time......\u201d. it\u2019s the garden with the cr\u00e8che, dogs and cigarette smoke. Well, with a heavy heart...will there actually be a \u201cnext time\u201d.....? Some neighbours walked past and stopped for a chat, as people always do when you\u2019re having your drinks on the balcony. They were equally as outraged when we told them. As will all the other friends and locals that we tell, except they\u2019re now all up at the Queen\u2019s Head instead.  It may not have a balcony over the river, but at least you\u2019re welcomed and valued as a regular and there\u2019s no danger of being thrown out by a security guard as if you\u2019re an ageing Sid and Nancy on a bender.  So welcome to our pub and neighbourhood. Come a cold November evening, if it\u2019s just you and the bouncers, pop up to the Queen\u2019s Head for a drink with the locals. We\u2019re actually all quite nice.", "date_of_review": "5 May 2018"}

Firstly it\u2019s setting is excellent, in Canbury Garden right by the River (Thames!). Second it\u2019s under new management which is neither good or bad as we can\u2019t compare it to before but maybe worth knowing. For example they are child and dog friendly. But now, in the main Dining Area, Dogs are no longer permitted but everywhere else is OK. There is plenty of Al Fresco seating with some overlooking the River and others by the side of the Restaurant where they serve BBQ Food in better weather. They serve CMRA Ales which looked very popular. They also have live Music so maybe worth checking this out if this floats your Boat! Our experience of the Food was mixed. 2 of us had Double British cheese burger with smoked cheese, maple cured bacon, burger sauce & skin on fries which cost \u00a313.50 each. I was feeling quite hungry and debated to myself whether this might be too much but actually it wasn\u2019t.

There didn\u2019t seem to be any Maple Cured Bacon but I didn\u2019t realise this until it was too late. Even if it had this, my appetite isn\u2019t huge but I left not feeling satiated. My wife had Crayfish with Avocado on Rye (?) bread which at \u00a38 or was it \u00a39 didn\u2019t deliver to its expectations. The Service was good but they weren\u2019t stretched.

Although located a short walk away from the main riverside pub/bar scene it certainly doesn't lack atmosphere or vibe.

The meat is always super fresh (mixed shish is the best) and you can see them cooking it. Humus is amazing and they serve it with a nice warm bread.. Also, often when we are too lazy for cooking in the evening (or late at night) we stop for a wrap: you can chose to have inside the shewers instead of the usual doner kebab (which i'm not a fan of, but here is pretty nice as well) and it's really really tasty. Another big plus is that is cheap, it's difficult in London to find this quality for the same price. The staff is super friendly (well they know us by now, last week they asked us if we wanted to sit down and have a tea while waiting for our take away!!) and alway extremely helpful.

Because of the location we were not surprised that the menu was on the pricey side but the only meal ordered by our party that we deemed good value for money was the poached smoked cod. The steak and ale pie came in a small enamel dish accompanied by a small portion of overcooked greens.

In recent years the menu and quality of food has improved; it was always good but not it is terrific! Today we decided to go early for a light lunch and gravitated to our favourite starter of double-fired calamari with teriyaki sauce and chilies. WoW! This is a dish which has to be tasted. he rest of the menu is great but I highly recommend this as a starters or a shared starter. Besides the food, the location is exquisite; right on the Thames which looks great in summer or winter. Cozy pub-like feel to the place and always buzzing. Then there is the staff. The folk who work the restaurant and the bar are always enthusiastic. Today I asked for the recipe for the calamari and, guess what, they share it with me. I will not try to cook it as getting the best calamari/squid is pretty difficult. Any criticisms? Yes. They don't serve Kronenbourg beer which s a pity as this is my favourite in the UK. But the the other choices are not at all bad! As for the prices, they are on par with most god gastro pubs and quite affordable. Try to take in the jazz on Sunday nights; booking needed if you want to dine at the same time. In summer and winter the outside patio area is also great as it is on the water and there are heaters. Dog friendly too. This is a 10 out of 10 place and a rare find which suits families during the day as well. Do not miss it! From Des and M in Kingston", "date_of_review": "1 October 2017"}

When booking I requested a west-facing table with a river view and we were given one which was thoughtfully set at 45 degrees so we could sit on two adjacent sides and both look out over the Thames at a glorious sun-set and slowly gliding swans.  And now onto the food: As a starter I had Crab Cakes (\u00a38). These were utterly tasteless but thankfully they were tiny (little bigger than a 50p piece) and I only got given three, so eating these bite-sized morsels did not take long at all. I\u2019d not want them ever again and you should certainly give them a miss too if, God forbid, they are still available when you dine here.  My wife, though, was pleased with her Blue Cheese & Nectarine starter (\u00a37.50), and with her main course Burger and skinny chips (\u00a313) although the accompanying 'Burger Relish', supposedly devised and then handmade by the Chef himself, looked and tasted like cheap Tartar sauce. She couldn't face it, and nor should you.  As my main course I had the 28-day-aged Scottish rib-eye steak (\u00a324) which came rare as requested and was delicious. It was a very decent size and accompanied by fat chips and a dressed watercress salad which were both excellent too, but the real treat was the peppercorn sauce (not an extra, as is so often the case, quite unnecessarily) which was fantastic, indeed the best I can ever remember tasting. So: 10 out of 10 for this particular dish. Our desserts were a Lemon Parfait and a Sticky Toffee Pudding (\u00a36ea). My wife thought her Parfait was \u2018very good\u2019 but I wouldn't want to rate my STP any higher than 'good'.  The bill, with a bottle of Merlot at \u00a321.50, came to \u00a397 including an \"optional\" 12.5% charge for service. It would be interesting to know how much of this quite handsome tip, if any, actually reaches the staff.   ", "date_of_review": "5 August 2017"}

Wonder why we were given the menu which had roast listed on it. Oh well. No worries...we modified our order. Then we waited...and waited...and waited for what appeared to be an eternity! We complained to the manager...and waited some more. Next time we complained we were told that somehow our order was misplaced/given away to other customers. They apologized profusely!

Fair enough, however about 20 minutes later, i heard him telling a couple behind us they had two beef roast dinners left? So I found that a little odd.  I had the burger, it was two 4oz patties cooked to absolute buggery and far too small for the bun. The woman sitting near us also had the burger and hers looked just as overcooked so I assume this is just the way they are served? I would suggest either using a single, bigger Pattie, or cooking the smaller ones for much less time, I've honestly tasted Big Macs that are nicer. The fries however were lovely.  The ice cream was very nice, however serving it piled up in a Kilner jar makes it very tricky to get to the bottom. I realise it's trendy, but I think a bowl is always better for ice cream.  Overall I'd visit again because the Jazz was lovely and the setting and service is nice, but I feel the food needs some work.", "date_of_review": "24 July 2017"}

One guy asked if we could sing Happy Birthday, and rather than politely declining, she decided to berate him, and tell us off for talking while she was singing. Our group were not sitting close to the band and nor was anyone drunk, disorderly or shouting so I don't understand why she felt the need to say that to us. Even the table next to us told us we were not being loud at all. I don't know of any bands that require complete silence from the audience, especially when we were only talking quietly amongst ourselves.

The star rating on here was a little off putting but we decided to give it a go anyway. Wow, we were so pleased that we did... we live in Surbiton and enjoyed the lovely walk along the Thames - it is a little further from the Kingston bridge than you might expect but what a find. We were welcomed warmly and menus were brought over to us, considering it was 4pm on a Tuesday we just expected to order from the bar so this was a great start. One of the bartenders (Emma) then came over with the drinks list and charmingly let us know they had a great selection of beers and they were more than happy to give samples. It is really lovely when you go into a place for a meal and receive not just service, but hospitality, and this is what we got.  We ordered the Squid to start and a surprisingly elegant dish was served in excellent time, piping hot and perfectly seasoned. We devoured this quickly and awaited the main course eagerly - when food is this good you should order a bottle of wine to celebrate, so we did. A neat little Pinot Noir from the Languedoc at \u00a324 - young, fruity and perfect value. When the steaks came out we both hastily cut into the middle to assess the cooking temperature - and simultaneously breathed a sigh of relief. We had ordered our ribeyes medium and they came exactly as specified, fat rendered down to a delicious crisp and the meat still juicy and red. The accompaniments were all entirely quaffable - chips, macaroni cheese, watercress all delicious and thoughtfully prepared. Not to mention the sauce Emma got us from the kitchen without hesitation! We ordered dessert and again the quality and care of the cooking was exceptional.  It is rare that both the kitchen and the front of house are so customer focused and deliver on every count so The Boater Inn has really impressed us today, we will be back many times.", "date_of_review": "6 December 2016"}

Starters: the squid was very salty with the sauce used and the prawns nothing special, slightly overcooked and probably not fresh. Both were small portions and I wouldn't recommend these dishes.  We ordered the roast beef but the food was an odd mixture of cold and hot: cold yorkshire pudding (which, had it been hot out of the oven would've been delicious as it was light, massive and crispy), warm-ish beef which was tender, slightly pink and went well with the tasty gravy. The veg though was lukewarm and the roast potatoes crisp on the outside, fluffy but strangely mouth burningly hot when compared to the rest of the dish! My partner though, said his potatoes were cold.. Whilst we were there, another table had a similar issue and sent 3 of their dishes back to the kitchen for being cold. We also ordered the sirloin steak and though it cost \u00a320, the cut of meat used did not measure up: it was grizzly, chewy and not really edible. We ended up leaving half of it on the plate which was disappointing.  The roast had real potential and I think I'd definitely go back to eat it again but the kitchen needs to work on their timings to ensure all, the food on each plate arrives at the table hot. It's really not acceptable to serve a dish that's part hot, luke-warm and cold. Hopefully this is something The Boaters can work on and it'd be great to be able to consider the restaurant as one of our preferred places for Sunday roast in Kingston! :)", "date_of_review": "11 December 2016"}

But as you wind your way through the dark park, towards the black, slippery river, flickering lights and strains of music beckon you on. Inside it was quiet, but after aperitifs of Prosecco and pints, people started filtering in and there was a convivial buzz. They'd let me come earlier to tie balloons to the chairs which, alongside their own fairy lights and tiny vases of flowers, made a festive little corner, looking right out at the water below us, with illuminated rowing boats still gliding across the ink. We ordered starters of garlicky, spiced prawns; sticky belly pork squares and terrine with black pudding pur\u00e9e; chicken liver parfait followed by one burger; one game pie; one steak and a confit duck with haricot beans. There was a side of truffled mac and cheese with spinach that was delicious.  Everyone was happy with their food - both the cooking and the quantity. The steak was smoky and tender, the game pie was rich with flaky pastry. The cassoulet was melting and unctious - just right for a Winter's evening. The wine list had some interesting choices and although everyone was too full for pudding, they brought the birthday girl a delicate dishful of cheesecake and ice cream with a birthday message on the plate. This was a welcome gesture and reminiscent of the Boater's in earlier incarnations when it felt like a real local.  In the twenty five years we have known it, it has changed hands countless times and has varied immensely from a friendly pub concerned with providing its regular clientele with good quality and consistency, to a characterless, indifferent corporate wannabe gastropub that never quite hit the mark. However, under its present management things are looking up.  We also went for the Boxing Day Bottomless Prosecco Brunch which was, indeed bottomless, with good, light and fresh food and attentive service, despite how busy they were. It was great fun.  So I would recommend the Boater's again. It's not particularly cheap, but pubs around here aren't these days. However the prices are lower than some other pubs in the immediate area and we felt the food was good value. You can't beat the location of course, but that's always been part of the problem. Some previous managements have relied on that and become complacent about everything else. But not this time. It's heading upstream and making a splash.

A lone piper wandered through the gardens of the pub, setting the scene for a Boaters Burns Night! There was a welcome glass of fizz or whisky & ginger at the door. The tables were adorned with thistles, candles and Scottish poetry.  The chef came out to introduce his 6 course menu (35 per head), which started with a little arancini style scotch quail egg resting on a tiny copper pan of smoky, steaming Cullen Skink. This was followed by smoked salmon 3 ways. Then a sorbet - Irn Brew sorbet - which caused a titter and was delicious.  After this the piper strode in, in full flow, heralding a haggis carried by the chef. A brilliant and animated address to the haggis was read out - he gied it laldy - and beast was stabbed. It was toasted with a tot of whisky which had magically appeared in front of us.  It was served up accompanied by tender beef brisket, rare beef, neeps and tatties. It was actually more elaborate and interesting than described here - but, probably due to the tot, I\u2019m struggling a bit with the details. However I do remember the chocolate desert and the nibble of tablet to round things off.  It was a fabulous night with delicious food and great attention to detail that made a real difference. A number of our party had Scottish blood and one was a quarter finalist on Masterchef - all with high standards and all very impressed. So Slange to the Boaters. Pure deed brulliant.", "date_of_review": "25 January 2020"}

My husband wanted more gravy as he\u2019s a gravy monster and an extra jug was brought out promptly. The veg was a good selection and not overcooked at all and the roasties were to die for. What impressed me most was that despite being really busy, the service was excellent. The waitress was brilliant in recommending desserts.

We had booked a table beforehand with the purpose of eating there for that evening. We were seated, given the menu and we decided to have a couple of drinks before deciding on food. Ordering drinks was a small ordeal, we were never checked on and had to almost \u201cbadger\u201d for service. After about an hour of drinks, our inattentive waiter came to take our food order only to tell us that both steaks on the menu were unavailable, after our order had been taken. It shouldn\u2019t have taken him until the point of ordering for him to tell us.  We also asked what cut of chicken was in one of the options that had only been labelled as \u201cflatiron\u201d chicken. He said he didn\u2019t know and then didn\u2019t bother to find out until my partner specifically requested for him to ask the chef, 10 minutes later. (We assumed he would go and find out so we could complete our order.) We then decided to stay and enjoyed a delicious meal of the aforementioned chicken, during which there was a changeover of staff.  Around 2 hours after initially ordering, low and behold, another customer was served the steak I had originally tried to order. Was it pre-ordered? Or was it a steak that had been defrosted whilst we had spent our evening there? Either way, it would have been nice for the original waiter to keep us in the loop to begin with I.e. explain that steaks had been preordered or weren\u2019t ready to be cooked yet and if we waited a while longer, we could have ordered them. It left a bitter taste being honest and felt as though certain patrons of the restaurant are treated favourably.  Also, side note, what kind of pub doesn\u2019t serve cocktails? And I don\u2019t mean cheeky vimtos, where are the negronis or old-fashioneds? Considering you can spend over \u00a315 on a piece of chicken, you\u2019d think they\u2019d be able to serve a decent cocktail. A shame, you can tell some of the staff work very hard and the chefs are obviously capable.  Not sure if we\u2019d go back. Maybe a pre-order of steak is what\u2019s necessary.", "date_of_review": "2 August 2020"}

Problems started as soon as we arrived. I had booked and requested an outside table. My friend sat at a suitable table in the shade, it was a hot day. I went inside to confirm my booking and said my friend was already sitting outside, to be told by the waitress no, that is not your table, as she. pointed to a table in full sunlight. I said we wanted to sit in the shade, and the waitress had to go and ask the manager if that was OK. How pathetic. So we got the table we wanted, what difference would it have made to them where we sat? My friend asked for a soda and lime. She was given soda water with a slice of lime, no lime juice. Said it was completely tasteless. What type of,person is working behind the bar? She didn\u2019t drink it. I ordered the main course \u00a310.50 salad, which must have cost them no more than 50p. A quarter of a pack for Rocket, plopped on the middle of a plate, with half a carrot underneath, a quarter teaspoon of hummus and a few chick peas. What a joke. Suitable for a baby rabbit. I asked if this was a starter, No said the waitress and would I like a bit more? I declined, getting really fed up now. Why not \u201cput a bit more\u201d on the plate to start with. So our meal was now getting worse. I had to eat some of my friend\u2019s chicken to at least fill me up a bit. I was a bit riled with my meal and asked to see the manager who was hardly inspirational. I said my meal was far too small for a main, I refused to pay \u00a310.50 for a such a small plate (OK it was the principle, \u00a310.50 isn\u2019t exactly a fortune) and he said nothing, just stood there. When I said I was prepared to pay for the starter size he jumped at this like a shot. He also took off the price of my orange juice.  We used to like Eggs Benedict at The Wheatsheaf, no longer on the menu. Perhaps this so called chef can\u2019t cook poached eggs. And maybe they are getting more greedy and offering less food because of all the money they have lost due to Covid. This is not the way to run a restaurant. We will not return.", "date_of_review": "16 September 2020"}

I spoke to the waiter who informed the Manager who then spoke to us. He asked whether we would like to move and I said it was not for us to move but the restaurant to maintain a safe distance for their guests. The other couple were moved, but the experience had left me in an extremely uncomfortable and awkward situation and not one that I would like to repeat.

The meal was a tad expensive at \u00a3120 since we didn't have a bottle of wine and my friend and I only had 1 beer each. Apparently the Tempranillo that my wife choose, was an eye watering \u00a37.30 a glass. We should have had the bottle @ \u00a321.75! They were serving my favourite beer Shere Drop, from the Surrey Hills Brewery, but it certainly didn't taste like it. I know my Shere Drop and it certainly wasn't that. Clearly, the barrels must have got confused, because I know what Shere Drop tastes like, even when it's on the turn or from dirty pipes. In summary, all this for \u00a3120, oh, and that excluded my \"Shere Drop\" and a glass of Prosecco that came to an additional \u00a311.40 when we first arrived! Would I return? Possibly for the food, but avoid the beer unless it's bottled!", "date_of_review": "24 January 2020"}

On arrival, we decided to get a drink at the bar as we were early. The service at the bar is awful! There were 5 staff behind the bar and none of them were serving! All busy dealing with orders from the restaurant area! Waited 15 minutes to be served! None of them looked at the waiting customers once to apologise for the delay. Eye contact was never made, it was like we were invisible.  To add insult to injury, when they eventually turned round to serve, they didn\u2019t ask who was next and just served who was in front of them!! 3 got served before me who came in after me! My god, that is so frustrating! When I complained, the barman just smiled! No apology! Didn\u2019t even answer me! Note to management - train your staff in bar management! Teach them how to say \u201cwho\u2019s next please?\u201d And can say 2 deal with the restaurant orders and 3 serve the bar customers? Also the girl behind the bar walked off to talk to her friend!! Seriously! There\u2019s so many waiting to be served here and you walk off to chat?!?! Unbelievable!! When we sat down at our table to eat, we were handed menus and then left for 25 minutes before we were asked if we want to order a drink! We were ready to order food by this point!  We complained and again no apology. She didn\u2019t even answer, just stared at us! Anyway, the starters were lovely! Prawn and Avocado and haddock fish cakes were really nice!!  I had the fish and chips for main and my girlfriend had the pork which were superb! Although the girl asked me if I would like ketchup and mayo, I said yes and didn\u2019t see her again. My girlfriends mum ordered the beef... don\u2019t ever order the beef!! Such a con!! 3 of the thinnest strips of beef we\u2019ve ever seen! About 6 inches long and an inch wide and a mm thick! Over cooked and so chewy that it had to be spat out! And you are required to pay \u00a32 more for the beef!  The con is a huge Yorkshire taking up half the plate with loads of veg, and a few potatoes costing pence for the restaurant and then tiny bits of inedible beef. The portions here are so mean and overpriced. We complained for the 3rd time and eventually the manageress apologised and refunded the cost of the beef.  We were then given desert menus and left for a further 20 minutes before asking for our order. We didn\u2019t bother as had had enough by then. Can not get anyone\u2019s attention!  Such a shame as the pub is brilliantly decorated and it\u2019s a great buzzy atmosphere! Have just moved to the area and was hoping to make it a regular for us/family/friends but we won\u2019t go back.  The staff need training in serving at the bar and tending to the tables quicker. Maybe employ more staff for the restaurant. The beef roast needs to have better quality meat and bigger portions. Toby Carvery roasts are far better.  So disappointed this won\u2019t be a regular.

The Wheatsheaf is an attractive looking pub/restaurant with separate drinking and eating sections. The menu was interesting and varied. We planned to go for two sharing plates and then a main course each. Our waiter encouraged us to just have the one sharing plate so we had room for our main course. He was right. Our sharing plate with pitta breads, houmous, olives, roasted pepers etc was fine for the four of us. Three of the four ordered main dishes from the specials list on the wall and the fourth chose from the standard menu. All of them were nicely presented and tasty meals. We had a bottle of wine to share - not over expensive and easy drinking with our food. Would certainly be happy to go to the Wheatsheaf again. Our waiter was excellent - helpful and keen that we enjoyed our meal. Exactly what I want from an evening out.", "date_of_review": "29 July 2019"}

However on this occasion there was a plague of bar flies, been told that this is a regular occurrence.  Worse of all the staff were getting ice for their own drinks using their fingers, considering all the bad press about dirty ice you would think that it would never happen. Staff need training on serving champagne, normally the ice bucket is generously filled with ice and water, then the bottle opened and at least the first glass poured? The margin of around \u00a330 perhaps warrants this, alas staff training is obviously an issue. There was also an excessive amount of fruit behind the bar, uncovered and feeding the bar flies.

One of the biggest observations was how friendly the staff were and how many were working (lots, in a good way), it seemed as though they had put a lot of training into the staff for the better! We both ordered steak, and I was seriously impressed at how good the meat was and how well it was cooked, perfect medium-rare. We followed it off with a descent espresso. The only slight let down, like so many good restaurants is when you ask for the bill. In all fairness the bill came quickly but it did feel like a while before someone came over with the PDQ machine.

We visited on a sweltering Saturday evening and the place was packed. There is plenty of room outside and a large dining room inside where we ate. We noticed air conditioning units on the ceiling but did not notice much effect as it was warm inside. We had a glass of Albury English sparkling wine as an aperitif which was excellent. I am always glad to see the English wine industry being supported, especially local wines such as this from near Guildford. For starters we had asparagus with broad beans, mint and feta which was perfect for a summer dinner - light and refreshing and tempura prawns and squid which was also very tasty. For mains we had two choices from the specials board. The thyme marinated pork with mash was described as being served with french beans but actually came with broccoli. The apple compote was missing and the red wine jus did not seem to have much red wine. The rump of lamb came with potato gratin and the same broccoli and jus as the pork. Despite the errors both were well cooked and delicious. We had a a lovely refreshing bottle of Rioja blanco from a good well priced wine list. Service was excellent- quick, warm and welcoming. In conclusion, well worth another visit and it compares very favourably with other local pub restaurants. Recommended.", "date_of_review": "8 July 2018"}

The Wheatsheaf on the green based on Esher green is certainly a lovely venue for a British pub. On first appearances it is a quiet looking pub that doesn\u2019t stand out however when you pull into the car park (which is a reasonable size) at 12:30pm only thirty minutes after it has opened on a Tuesday and find the car park is almost full it is has to be a good sign. Entering the pub the first thing that hit me was how open and bright it was with a nice atmosphere and plenty of full tables. As you would expect on a weekday it was mainly retired ladies and gentlemen which is not always bad especially if they are as opinionated as my grandparents (trying not to use the word fussy). The menu is presented very well and has a fantastic selection of food and drinks with a perfect number of dishes and great explanations. The staff were happy to explain further if needed.  I do have a strong opinion about how full the table is with cutlery, glassware and decorative stuff. Obviously this is dependent on the type of restaurant I am eating in but in a pub a limited layout is much better, The Wheatsheaf does this very well. The waitress took away the wine glasses as soon she asked if we were having wine with lunch (I wanted to say yes but probably best not to), she was very attentive and asked all the right questions and could answer any that I had.  We ordered a sharer camembert (a reminder I was with one of my friends I am not as greedy as I look) which was a fantastic size with a good amount of bread and vegetables to dip, including mooli a Japanese reddish. For mains we both had a burger; one veggie and one meat. Now when you have chunky twice cooked chips on the menu you expect a small number stacked up at the side of your plate which I understand in fine dining especially when you have five courses to get through but in a pub The Wheatsheaf have the right idea with a plate full of plenty. The burger itself was ok, a little overcooked and a little dry but garnished very well with pickles, lettuce, tomato and off course the best bit cheese and bacon. The food presentation was better than your normal pub, the chef clearly takes pride in his food.  Overall I was happy with the lunch experience which reflects my score. I will certainly be booking a table for dinner and hope the experience will be equal or better.", "date_of_review": "20 March 2018"}

The menu here, with a veggie curry, Tuscan bean casserole and vegetable \u201cstack\u201d as the offerings here. Sorry to say to me as a veggie these sounds like bland rabbit food. If I want a curry- I go to an Indian restaurant NOT a pub. Bean casserole just sounds really unexciting. The vegetable stack is the veggie alternative on their burger options but this is pure laziness by the chef! There are 1000s of amazing recipes for veggie burgers around, as demonstrated by GBK who now offer 4 amazing veggie burgers on their menu. To simply stack 4 vegetables on top of each other is nowhere near the same as tucking into a burger and it\u2019s a shame they cant see this. They offer a gnocchi with meat sauce- how about a rich, creamy but simple butternut sauce for veggies? Or ask Chef to create an actual homemade, veggie burger?

Have visited many times for dinner during the week. Have found the restaurant to be consistently excellent featuring a range of starters, mains and a short list of desserts. The food is prepared carefully and presented well, the ingredients are always fresh resulting in a very high standard of cuisine. We chose the battered cod, peas and handcut chips, lamb cutlets and a fillet of salmon_ impeccably cooked, tasty and tender with thoughtful accompanying vegetables and potatoes and sauces. All very good. Priced competively especially considering the standard. A little disappointed that calves liver ( my personal favourite and really excellent) has been dropped from the menu! I got over it_ the fillet of salmon was great. The dessert menu was enticing_ try the chocolate fudge brownie sundae! Service friendly and attentive. All highly recommended.

Only little niggle is the bang bang chicken salad is a little on the bland side and needs twice as much peanut butter/crushed peanuts and more sweet chilli sauce in order to be standout (I\u2019ve had it last two visits). Chips are lovely and chunky but a little undercooked. Very good selections for kids and they are super accommodating. Great puddings too, so make sure you leave some room!

No unreserved tables available, was told I could sit at a reserved table until the booking time, we had planned to be there until 7pm or later. At 6.10pm we were told the people who had booked for 6.30 had arrived and could we now move! The only option available now was to stand at the bar, this wasn\u2019t acceptable so we drank up and went to another pub very nearby with better seating, atmosphere and excellent choice of real ales.  I have no problem with tables being booked in the bar area but 10 or more is crazy. You have no standing area with shelving so the choice is stand in the middle of the pub and hold your drink, stand at the bar or go elsewhere.

The bar was busy but we weren't in a terrific hurry, after all we'd started looking for somewhere to eat around Beaconsfield so a another 5 minutes or so wouldn't worry us. I immediately recognised the menu because it's identical to The Old Plough in Cobham which we know and love. The Wheatsheaf does not disappoint with a lovely interior, friendly staff, good drinks menu and carefully prepared cocktails. If Esher was closer to Dorking I'm sure we'd be regular visitors. Rather like at the Cobham pub we opted to select several items from the starter menu and create our own little tapas.

He worked hard but made it look easy, specially aware, juggling lots of customers and keeping them all happy, funny, smart and with a fluid knowledge of his craft.

One had Bang bang peanut satay chicken, oriental crunchy vegetable salad followed by Twice cooked belly of pork, creamy mash, wilted kale, cranberry compote & red wine jus. Both helpings were large, especially the starter which had a generous amount of chicken. The other had Conisbee\u2019s Cumberland sausages, Colcannon mash, onion gravy & crispy shallots. The gravy was extremely good. I had Cod, smoked salmon, crayfish and spring onion fishcakes, pickled vegetables, rocket, dill & mustard hollandaise followed by Braised crispy Gressingham duck, parsnip mash, spinach, peppercorn sauce. The duck, two pieces, was very good indeed, well cooked and succulent. We were also given a large bowl of vegetables as an accompaniment. All three of us really enjoyed the meal.

Browns of Bexley is now achieving what every other modern Deli aspires to, after only a few months of being open. They sell what you would expect from a deli i.e. meats, cheeses, olives and does excellent coffee too. What is so impressive the the choice of other deli goods. It must be difficult to select products for a shop that could effectively sell any foodstuffs they want. Browns has selected some of the most innovative products available, rather than cram shelves with overpriced supermarket products. The prepared food is also excellent. The owner makes all sorts of baked goods each day and sells them for really reasonable prices. They are just wonderful.

There are not. It feels like the groups successful formula has somehow been executed here on a tighter budget and fixtures and fittings (especially on the way to and in the toilets) are showing sign of wear or the original poorer workmanship.  That would pale into insignificance were the food as good. It is not. Again the formula for the group - namely the menu staples - is the same but it looses something in the delivery. Both our mains were only just warm - a casserole should not be and wilted spinach isn't nice when cool. We concluded they had been sitting around for a while as we were the only ones being served and staff training seemed to be happening in parallel - a case of eye slightly off the ball.  Otherwise service was friendly, reasonable sized car park and well tended small outside area with seating. Prices reasonable.

Not a huge portion, and perhaps a little more expensive than usual but nothing ridiculous and I would rather go for quality over quantity any day.   The staff were very friendly (to us and our dog), chatty and helpful, reading my wife's mind for some extra gravy with lunch! This was our first visit, we were passing and stopped in on a whim, so we were very glad that we found the place.

It was superb, consistent great food and good service..  Then it slipped a little and after one visit on a Sunday lunchtime with friends I vowed never to return. The food was appalling. Yesterday I decided to give them another chance and whilst the food didn't dazzle me it was good and of an acceptable standard. The Roast beef was good, a huge Yorkshire pud along with well cooked roast potatoes. Gravy let it down slightly as one would have expected a rich red wine jus rather than bistro but all the same it was entirely edible. The one thing that was horrendous were the vegetables. A tiny portion in small bowl of overcooked mush between two persons was shocking.  Eaton mess for pud was good quality albeit missing a few more strawberries or a coulis to compliment the sweetness of the white chocolate. An improvement! Its a beautiful pub with a fabulous location! I shall return and hope that some day this place returns to its former glory!", "date_of_review": "8 May 2017"}

Also there is a deserts menu that all you desert lovers would dribble over but for me im not a full on pudding person and they have a fix for that- dark, milk or white fair trade chocolate bars, just for that touch of sweetness after gorging. Youre looking at about \u00a38 starter and \u00a315 main but honestly the food is worth that. There is one thing that has to have a mention before I stop waffling...The gin coctail!!

The prices were way over the odds but that may be because i am used to devon prices. Pub though very impressive and bar staff and waiting staff a real credit to the owners and made the entire evening. The ladies loos were clean and tidy as was the pub itself.

Given we were recommended to come here and this is under the same ownership as the Crown in St Margarets where we go fairly often, it was a huge disappointment. Credit where credit is due, the food, as with the Crown was pretty faultless apart from the desert, more of which later. From the outset the service was appallingly slow. We had to chase our first drinks which took 20 minutes to arrive and it did not appear hugely busy, just bad management of the staff on duty. The main course was again slow to arrive but I had the calves liver and my friend had the fish and chips, the latter looked rather heavy on the batter and light on the fish. More issues with the desert, suffice to say the passion fruit lemon posset with raspberries came without the raspberries and when we tried to catch the eye of the staff it was almost impossible and we were pretty much ignored. The final irritation was at the end when a quiet and quite reasonable complaint was made to the Manageress about the bill which had an odd item on it and we were told it was something else but with a different name ?! Her inability to understand customer service was annoying - rather than asking me what I wanted her to do, it would have been simple for her to simply offer to remove one or 2 of the items on the bill as a gesture of goodwill. It was not my place to educate her in the art of customer service. All in all pretty appalling and suffice to say we will not be returning here again.", "date_of_review": "31 March 2016"}

We were not disappointed. An excellent meal was had by all. As there were 10 of us, we were given a lovely large table tucked away from the main body of the restaurant which was still atmospheric but more private. Slightly less loud, than if we'd been in the middle of the restaurant which was extremely busy. We had an excellent waiter looking after us, who was friendly and very efficient. The food as always was delicious. If I were to make one very small comment, it would be my starter (I had mushrooms on toast) appeared as a smaller portion than I've previously eaten. It wasn't a problem at all as the mains and desserts are still fairly large portions, however I just felt the price of the starter at \u00a37.50 was a tad expensive for its size.  Thank you to The Wheatsheaf for a lovely evening. If you're thinking of eating at a Pub in the area, then this one is a must.

Car parking at rear was getting a bit full, but it was not too busy when we visited so may be a problem at busier times. Nice restaurant area at rear (bar area at front looks very relaxing) with high ceiling but most of the seating was around the outside which didn't leave enough room between tables - centre of restaurant was one large table, with loads of space. Good choice on menu but thought it quite pricey. So even though we were being treated, Mr Crow chose a sandwich option but was a bit apprehensive that it would be a bit fancy in presentation but lacking in substance. He need not have been concerned, it was excellent, a good size and very tasty. All other members of the party enjoyed theirs very much. Service was good and reasonably attentive but the restaurant wasn't too busy - may be a different story at busier times. The bill was not cheap but for what everyone had, it was reasonably priced and everyone left having eaten enough. Hopefully the Crow family will be treated to a meal there again sometime. Unfortunately the venue was let down by excessive noise, caused by a noisy centre table and young children being allowed to run around. The staff and parents appeared to try keep things calm, but Mr Crow believes that a restaurant, especially one like The Wheatsheaf, is a place to eat not play.

This used to be my favorite Italian in London that I recommended to everyone, I haven't been there for a while and was excited to invite my mom for a dinner when she came to visit me. I wanted to order pasta with clams however the waitress said they didn't have it and offered a seafood pasta for 3 extra pounds (19 pounds) that wasn't on the menu, I agreed - the dish arrived with 1 (!) prawn, rubber-like squid, you could barely find any octopus and the sauce was not tasty at all unlike on my previous visits. Mom's Lasagna was ok. On top of that, we ordered 2 glasses of Montepulciano wine that was listed for \u00a36 for a small glass on the menu but appeared to be \u00a37 on the bill... we were also charged \u00a33.80 for a bottle of water that was brought opened and looked like a tap water, and another \u00a36 for service charge - so \u00a312 pounds extra on top of our food bill. \u00a0 So \u00a355 for 2 pastas and 2 small glasses of wine - really mediocre dinner, not worth the money.

The food we had was the Duck Noodle soup it was lovely! The stock of the soup was a bit tasteless however the meat and general food was excellent. Service was good, The drinks variety is impressive. Good place however I can see why it may be overlooked as I did not know of it\u2019s existence prior to my visit because it\u2019s location is slightly out of the way from where people would typically go looking for a restaurant. Reasonably priced and clean and authentic interior,  Service: 9/10 (Credit to the blonde waitress, Just needs to be that bit more confident when she talks but otherwise was a great host Food: 7/10 (Basically a cheaper Wagamama\u2019s but still very good) Will I come back: YES!

Avoid!", "comment": "Where do I start.  The staff were pretty bad. Especially the girl - she was really rude to my mother. When my mother was giving her order, instead of saying pardon she looked at my mother displeased and resigned - 'I can't hear you!'. Also when taking my wife's order she seemed clueless on the wine, no table to offer some advice on the house wine. It almost seemed like the waitress didn't want to be there...  The main guy (manager??) seemed to be going around like he wanted to be helpful but didn't know how to be, he was kind of useless!! The kind of guy that liked to look like he was important but essential he was inadequate when we were there. The food was pretty mediocre. The chips that came with my food and my niece's meals were pretty measly and the lamb shank my mother got looked like a hot mess. My sister had a steak that she described as being like donkey meat. When the manager saw that she wasn't able it eat it instead of asking her was there a problem he just looked disappointed as if to say 'you didn't finish it!'. I think we all felt so disheartened and would normally complain but we just wanted to leave - the experience was that bad. My wife had a nice vegetarian meal so it wasn't all bad, just most of it was!!  Definitely wouldn't have tipped but the chancers had it included in the bill... Overall it was quite pricey too. Side note: there was a birthday do on for a separate party, and this cheesy backing track, dimmed lights and disco ball (above the entrance) went into overtime as a birthday cake was brought out. Fair enough the people were on a night out and no discredit to them, but from the restaurant's side it all came across as disingenuous after the experience we had.", "date_of_review": "18 July 2017"}

My family and I visit the Good Earth in Esher quite regularly and the food in here is at the same standard but in a closer location and a lot cheaper. The food, again, is delicious and the staff seem to put a lot of thought and effort into each and every one of them. Calvin, the owner, is so kind and caring as are the other staff here.

Bread and butter and carrots and celery and dip provided at the start so nobody is ever impatient to be served.  My smoked salmon starter was a delight. It's more than I eat for lunch.

I ordered dessert of the day which was pecan tart and it was served with design of a table clef in sauce on the plate. Ground floor toilets are convenient for speed and anybody disabled. The decaff coffee was included in the set meal price. We hung around at the end and were not rushed to go. My leftovers were wrapped up. I must go there more often.

They are always making sure you and your meal is exactly how you would like it, and always accommodate me and my \"extra parmesan\" lol  Honestly - whether your going with your friends / family or romantic meal - try this place - you wont be disappointed!

We both ordered pasta, which took a while to come so we ordered bread in the mean time, we weren't given oil or butter but noticed that the two tables beside us received oil. Then our pasta arrived. I understand in Italy they often serve pasta courses as first courses, so even though we were slightly shocked by the small portion (\u00a315 each) we let it slide...hoping for the most tantalising taste experience of our lives. We were greeted by unseasoned, plain, tasteless food. It was literally terrible. I've received greater joy from eating microwavable meals. We then asked for the bill and were made to wait ten minutes for the card machine as the waitress chatted with some male customers to our right, completely ignoring us, so we had to ask again.

Wine list was short but well priced with some lovely Gavi di Gavi on offer which they put on ice for us. The fish was extremely fresh and perfectly, simply cooked.

Wholemeal sliced bread was one offering the other were slices of a white baguette and butter in re packed pieces....a bit naff really. The waitress took our order and the starters arrived quickly. The minestrone was ordinary and I think had been sitting in a big bowl for some time, the triicolore was simply ok. As soon as the starters were taken away the next course arrived. My Escalope Milanese was not great, barely fried and very tasteless. The accompanying pasta had clearly been sitting in a big bowl and scooped off as needed. My wife's sea Bass was utterly tasteless and was served on a bed of awful tasting spinach. Now as for the vegetables, you could not order what you wanted, you got a serving of what they had and again over cooked. Boring and lack of freshness. I have no doubt that many of the desserts were bought in for example orange sorbet in the skin or lemon sorbet. It was a pre printed dessert menu like you find in many Indian Restaurants.

The zabaglione was fine but the pavlova was dreadful - it wasn't pavlova at all, it was a shop bought pure white meringue nest with a bit of fruit and it wasn't nice at all. When we said this to the waitress she agreed and called the manager who was, frankly, very rude and kept repeating that it was a popular dessert and we were wrong to say it wasn't a pavlova. It doesn't matter how popular it is (and the clientele was quite elderly and the dessert probably was a popular one in the '70s), it wasn't as described and we felt the manager was unnecessarily rude when we said we'd expected the dessert to be a homemade pavlova rather than something we could have bought in the local supermarket.

My other friend ordered the Pera Al Forno which is an interesting mixture of fruit and cheese. For main course we had 2 veal in breadcrumbs, 1 veal in mushroom sauce and 1 seafood pasta. All was very good although one of the veal was a bit chewy.

Not the best ? No - but consistently very good value. Large selection, complimentary crudit\u00e9s, very drinkable house wines and friendly service. Recently took friends from Italy - they thought it excellent value and good, authentic food. We are regulars and have never been disappointed. Is the clientele mainly retirees ? Yes - but we are the discerning and well behaved population; and our grandchildren love it, too. So what's wrong with that ? Well with a try !", "date_of_review": "1 July 2014"}

It was traditional English Italian restaurant food, not really what you find in Italy.

I did not have a starter but the rest of out party had various starters which they all said were very good. I had the fillet steak which are huge at 11ozs and it was absolutely mouth watering. I asked for a different sauce with my steak as I do not like pepper sauce and they made me a Maderia sauce instead. I must admit I had never had such a huge steak and although quite hungry found it a little to much to eat it all and I really hate wasting food. Apart from the steak there were only a few vegetables on the plate, but probably just as well. I had their Tiramisu for dessert and it was one of the best I have tasted. We were looked after and our drinks topped up by the different staff . I can thoroughly recommend this restaurant.", "date_of_review": "8 July 2014"}

It's usually full so booking ahead is needed, especially for the Early Bird offer before 7pm. The decor is really beautiful, with stars in the deep blue ceiling and a nice mural of Venice all around reflected in lots of mirrors. It's clean and the staff are welcoming. the Early bird 2 course menu is well priced, and the food when it arrive is well cooked. There are lots of crudites on the table to start with, though not much bread. The butter comes in horrible little Anchor wrappers you have to fiddle with to open them. The first course arrived reasonably soon after we ordered. The leek and potato soup was tasteless, and there was no salt or pepper on the table. We then waited...and waited...and waited...for nearly 45 minutes, for the main course. There ere two waitresses wandering around seating new customers and serving more crudities, the manager behind the bar shaking cocktails and no one else for a while, then more waitresses seemed to appear but no luck. They wandered round and round our apparently invisible table, appearing to be in a daze, till we called one over who suddenly seemed to jolt herself awake for a few seconds but seemed no to know why we were there at all. Had we been accidentally dropped there out of train carriage through a worm hole? When she realised we were there to eat and awaiting food she disappeared off to the kitchen and we waited another ten minutes before the really rather well prepared food arrived. We noticed that nearly everyone else was in the same situation and came to the conclusion that the management had cynically decided to finish off all the scrounging Early Bird first courses together regardless of when people arrived before allowing the customers to have any more to eat. we then looked at the dessert menu which was also rather nice, but by then our teenager got rather grumpy about all the hanging about, the adults were filled with dread at the thought of waiting another hour, and so we called the manager over and got the bill, which came very promptly. We'll try the Italian just next door which was fuller earlier next time round.", "date_of_review": "26 October 2014"}

The place was full and the staff just about coped but service was definitely patchy. Because the place is small the tables are packed tightly together which means if you're not careful you'll have your elbow in somebody else's food (or vice-versa). The food is pretty much what you'd expect for a suburban \"Italian\" restaurant, nothing exciting but then again nothing to upset the horses. The only dish to stand out was the fresh zabaglione which was excellent, even then the portions were so huge nobody managed to finish one.  The wine list is rather strange, seems to have no structure, and no house wine. I tried the first on the list, a Trebbiano, which was fine and reasonably priced compared to others on the list so I suppose that was the \"house white\". As you walk out of the door of this restaurant you can see at least three other Italian restaurants within a few yards. if the menu and prices of this place appeal to you then go and you'll have an OK meal, if they don't then there are lots of other choices.", "date_of_review": "9 April 2014"}

My wife's main of sea bream was tasty and light, my monkfish however was plentiful but not really tasting of anything much. Some of the pasta al forno dishes going past looked a better bet. Lamb shank was tender and enjoyable. Overall the meal was only \u00a325 a head (no wine as several drivers) so reasonable value and very good portions, but generally standard fare that my parents find enjoyable and to be fair the restaurant was completely packed so they must be doing something that the clientele like.

The deco is great with a Venetian painting stretching from one end to other of regatta bridge. Sadly this was the highlight. We found a early bird menu 2 courses for \u00a310.95. Picking up the menu was expecting the list of traditional menus such as bolognese etc. lasagne was the only italian on the list in the mix of tiger prawn and garlic mushroom starters? The starter was deep fried prawns , with a main of lasagne , perhaps homemade but tasted cheap ingredients, followed by what looked and tasted like a frozen cheesecake. For 10.95 wasn't looking for heaven and earth but basic customer service and service with a smile was something that lacked here. A sense of didn't want to be there was in the air from the get go from staff. Waiting for the bill was an effort trying to get what appeared to be the managers attention was a struggle as he enjoyed a conversation with some friends at the bar. Not a traditional experience after all, poor Customer service coupled with average food , saved by the deco. Not enough to return , both ask and sazio may deliver what I was originally looking for.", "date_of_review": "9 January 2013"}

Good service and no hurry, even though it was full. I have used this restaurant several times and always been pleasantly surprised. I have used other restaurants in Hatch End, but this, overall, does seem to have the edge. My only criticism is that apart from the house wine (which is quite good) the others are becoming a little too expensive and so we limit ourselves to one, or go to the pub first \u2013 Owner, please take note, drop your prices and I\u2019ll spend more! Few restaurants can make Zabaglione (for pudding) \u2013 this one can and for those who don\u2019t know, only a very good chef can make it without it curdling. Next time you are in, try it.

Instead I had tiger prawns in a sweet chilli sauce. Fairs, fair. They were not bad. My main course was an escalope of veal in a pizzaoila sauce. The veal was paper thin and almost invisible under this enormous pouring of tomato and garlic sauce. Not nice. The zucchini were soggy, the plate was full of other vegetables too on the maxim that if you cannot serve quality serve quantity. My wife had monkfish which she normally loves but not this time.

Got a table last minute and the place was packed. Clientele mostly elderly groups or couples looking very prim and proper and well coiffured. Think there was one young couple there of about 60. Starter of avocado bland and unappealing. Main course of lamb shank on bed of mash tasteless and cooked till every bit of flavour had disappeared. A kind of watery gravy accompanied it ....totally lacking flavour. A mishmash of overcooked veg served alongside it did nothing to restore the flavour - from the chewey battered zucchini to the overcooked green beans to the frozen roast and dried out potato to the one lonely slice of carrot that mysteriously found it's way on to my plate. The Wine was pricey for such an average restaurant, with the exception of the House wine. The staff lacked any exuberance and were very inattentive, just doing the minimum. Overall a disappointing experience, but no doubt the ageing clientele with their dwindling tastebuds will be sufficient to keep this place afloat for some time to come.", "date_of_review": "19 May 2013"}

But I was in Kensington and dropped in on Pizzicotto on the High St. Pizzicotto took it up a notch with 72 hour proofed dough. I thought it might be like those dubious deodorants that claim 48 or 56 hour protection but the difference was definitely there in taste terms. The base was more solid and flavoursome than others in London. However the real difference was in the ingredients. We had the margherita special which had oozing light mozzarella and a rich tomato sauce that was truly delicious. It was flavourful and didn't seep into the dough and made it anything but the boring choice. Our other pizza was the spacca Napoli with silky anchovies to go with the mozzarella and tomato toppings. Again this was first rate.  We could tell that all the ingredients were well sourced and were very likely the best available in London - it's why the price tag of 9.50 for a cheese and tomato pizza seemed reasonable.  Once the cinema is up and running next door I'll definitely make this a regular haunt on movie nights", "date_of_review": "16 June 2015"}

I had a mushroom soup followed by a veal in a mushroom and cream sauce and finished with a slice of sacher torte. The soup was excellent and the sacher torte light and tasty. The veal was well cooked but the sauce a little bland and the vegetables accompanying it a bit sparse. The bread provided was white only and not up to much and my white wine was a bit warmer than I would have liked. And bread was not specifically provided with my soup. I didn't want any more of what I'd had so didn't ask.  My fellow guests had a variety of dishes including a Camembert starter, tricolore salad, fish goujon, steak and ice cream.

I have to say that the plates are overloaded, quantity rather than quality but the clientele are happy and feel its value for money and obviously popular based on the other reviews! Now this is the first time I have put in any review as I feel you should know about the staff who are rude, off hand and positively insulting! I will try my hardest to stop my parents visiting this establishment again.  Earlier this year the waitress asked my father if he enjoyed his starter (she actually didn't seem interested) and when he said it was \"not the usual and was very salty\" she said well you ate most of it so it couldn't have been...Yes quite funny really but she should have handled this so much better. My father is 88 and her looking up to the ceiling and tutting is just rude. In my opinion I think they view the elderly as a burden and that its OK to treat them like naughty children and an inconvenience. The next time my parents wanted to visit there was a larger party and unfortunately for me this was their choice to eat here (again). This time however after the bill was paid (thanks Dad) the waitress said \"wasn't it you who was in last week sitting in the front by the window?\" \"No\" my Dad replied. \"Oh yes it was you I remember you!\" Off she went and then started waving a cheque in his face! \"Yes this is yours!\" It was not. If she had simply checked the surname against his card she would have noticed they didn't match! Not really rocket science! How to ruin a perfectly nice evening.

Atmosphere was superb, great lighting, laid back ambience with calm acoustic music played quietly. Had the Sardinian white wine which was fantastic. Staff were very polite and chilled, not constantly pestering as you find in chain restaurants these days. Had the Parsnip Soup to start which was sensational, followed up by the calzone. I cannot recommend wood fired pizza enough, no other form is comparable. By this point we were too full for dessert but the espresso was of an equally good standard.

Pizzicotto, a charming, elegant and contemporary bistro 10 minute walks from Kensington High Sreet tube is the absolute opposite of this. In fact I'd say they make the best pizza in London! I dreamt about the pizza for weeks after my first visit - the chef is from Naples and you can absolutely tell - his pizzas are the most Italian and most delicious in the whole city. Last time we ate there (we've been several times to satisfy my cravings!) we also had the pasta which was equally impressive.  The wine list is wonderful - some delicious and little known Italian wines. I'd recommend the Salice.

It was first class, unobtrusive service whilst warm and welcoming. the waiters and waitresses were excellent and attentive, determined to make your experience a pleasant one...as if you were just one of the family. Two of us took advantage of the veal...one accompanied by vegetables, the other by spaghetti. The spaghetti was the most delicious I have tasted outside Italy! There was so much of it I had to admit defeat, the veal was scrumptious. I have to say I do not have a conscience about this particular type of veal but others may. The other two had a steak with mushrooms and a rich sauce...one well done and the other 'less well done'! Each was happy with their steak. Again the portions were more than ample.

We'd booked via \"Open Table\" for 6pm & although we were the first evening diners by the time we left about an hour and a half later the place was full.  The service was friendly & professional & the food just what we needed after walking around the Capital.  Starters were well presented & delicious - the seafood soup brimming with clams, squid & prawns. Chris & Matt had a plate of mixed antipasti & a scallop dish both of which disappeared very quickly. Chris said that the garlic bread was the best he'd had & he's just returned from a holiday in Southern Italy! Mains were a wonderful wood-fired pizza, squid-ink pasta & seafood spaghetti which just about filled us up. I had a couple of glasses of their floral Falanghina - I could have shared a bottle but the boys are non-drinkers! Unfortunately we had no room for \"puds\" but I did have room for a beautifully rich double-expresso. We'd certainly return here again as it was a pleasure to eat authentic Italian food in a \"non-chain\" restaurant at reasonable prices for central London.", "date_of_review": "29 October 2016"}

The restaurent is large for its location and there have been several previous restaurants in the same venue which have failed. I walk past the restaurant regularly and have noticed that most of the time it is not very full and when we visited on a Sunday afternoon there where only two other customers in the restaurant. The food is mainly Chinese with a few other asian dishes. Its a bit like Wagamama in that you tend to order one dish main course with sides/starters and the food is quite authentic unlike most Chinese restaurants in the UK. We found that Chinese dishes tended to be better than the other asian dishes. In particular we enjoyed the Char Siu (BBQ Pork) and the Tofu. The prices are reasonable and the decor and attention to detail are very good. Will definitely visit again.", "date_of_review": "30 April 2017"}

I must say, the food in here is spectacular. My wife and I are regulars at the Good Earth in Esher and this food is up to their standard, at almost half the cost. The dishes are so tasty, flavoursome and a lot of thought seems to have gone into each dish.  My daughter had not been well all day (and bless her, it was her birthday) and felt too poorly to continue to dessert. Calvin, the lovely manager, had organised a cake for the birthday girl and insisted she and her sister took a cake home each on the house. He offered one to my step-son too and it was such a lovely gesture.  These guys deserve success for their food, for what they went through in closing and for the lovely people they are.

Pizzicotto seems like the kind of place where the staff wants to know its customers, and when we returned for a proper dinner two days later, we were recognized and warmly greeted. For our second meal, we ate more heartily, having antipasto, primi and secondi. Everything was very good. I recommend the chargrilled scallops and the spaghettini alla vongole.

We shared lamb skewers to start, the skewers were ok, my partner had crispy chilli beef for his main, this was probably one of the best crispy chilli beefs, the pieces of beef were very crispy and light, and the sauce was tasty and slightly sweet. I opted for char sui and duck with rice, the duck was slightly salty and tasted delicious, the pork was good. Overall I enjoyed the dish but felt it needed a sauce, so ended up spooning over some my partners sauce onto my dish. For dessert my partner opted for lime sorbet, it was very strong and very tart, I opted for an opera gateaux, it was far too sweet for my liking and I wouldn't order it again as I was expecting rich dark flavours that were well balanced with coffee flavours to come through but the sweetness made the dessert unpleasant for my palate. The ambience was good, the service was quick and pleasant and for \u00a340 for a starter, two mains, two non alcoholic drinks, and two desserts it provided good value for money.", "date_of_review": "22 October 2017"}

I convinced myself were were in for a poor dining experience and I've never been so wrong.  The restaurant is modern looking with comfortable seating. The serving staff were all helpful, polite and cheerful, but the best thing of all is the food - really really good. I had ribs in a 'Peking' sauce that were probably the best I've ever had in a Chinese restaurant - meaty, a good amount of fat and a delicious sauce. Similarly, the satay chicken, beautifully marinated, cooked to perfection and served with a lovely fix of peanut sauce. I also had shredded duck with vermicelli rice noodle soup - lemon prawns with sesame seeds - a beautifully tasty classic roast duck and the obligatory shredded crispy duck pancakes probably the only average course of the evening) Looking at the menu, you don't see anything very different from many Chinese restaurants, but the chefs at Yimchai have tweaked their recipes and chosen excellent ingredients. The four in our party all had jasmin tea along with other drinks, complimentary water and more than enough to eat, but our evening cost less than \u00a325 per head - we were amazed !!

When we arrived our table wasn't ready so we were invited to have a drink at the bar. Unfortunately the barman didn't have much of a clue, serving us Hendricks Gin with ice and a slice, eventually. We sat down and the food being served around us looked lovely. The manager came over to take our order, giving us advice on the menu, albeit with some slight attitude. The odd huff and a puff. When the food arrived it looked lovely and indeed my wife and her friend enjoyed their meals. Between the two of us guys, we shared a steak and their 'award winning' pizza, both if which was cold. Tasted ok, but cold. I didn't want to make an issue because whilst I am sure they would have replaced it with a warm/hot version, it would have meant our partners having finished their meals by the time we started ours. When the waiter/manager came to clear our plates, he asked if everything was ok. I always compliment where compliments are due but I also believe that it is necessary to state the facts if things aren't quite right too. I told him it was cold - \"really?\" he said, shook his head and walked off. When they eventually brought the bill (\u00a3189 for the four of us!) the lady asked again if everything was alright and I told her too. She carried on taking payment. My grievance is not about the food here per se, but don't ask the obligatory \"was everything ok?\" if you intend to ignore the answer. Almost 50 quid a head for an ok pizza, albeit cold, and an ok steak, also cold, is a lot to pay.

OK we thought we can decide in a few minutes and nice to know in advance. We arrived at 2.20 and were seated straight away. Menu's followed shortly and we ordered a couple of beers to drink whilst we considered our order. The waitress came back in a short while for our order which we started to give ( at around 2.30) . As soon as my wife started to order her starter the waitress advised that the kitchen was closing shortly and so if we wanted a starter it was fine but to be aware that it would have to be served with the main so we'd end up with the starter and the main being delivered at the same time and the main would just have to go cold. Not to mention that the table wasn't really large enough to take four plates on it at once.....This was very very disappointing indeed and ruined an otherwise perfect meal for us. I cannot believe ( and have never heard of ) any restaurant taking a booking and then essentially refusing to cook for you because they were shutting the kitchen. In my experience a restaurant decides it's hours but keeps it's staff on until the last reservation has been served.  The service was great....as was the food which included a hefty service charge on top which we paid btw ! And we'd go again. Just not at that time . Be warned", "date_of_review": "28 November 2017"}

The food was good - we both chose tagliatelle al ragu, and I would guess the pasta was homemade. For starters I had burrata with chargrilled zucchini and tomatoes and my friend had fried calamari - both very pleasant. The calamari dish, strangely, was described as \"fritto miso\" on the menu - \"fritto\" certainly but not \"misto\"! The bill for two, including a glass of Valpolicella each and coffee, came to \u00a381, which we thought expensive for two courses - in fact probably not much different from Il Portico, which is altogether calmer and more relaxing. It was Sunday, of course, and there were family parties there, but it was a bit too noisy for our liking. Cheerful and pleasant staff, however.", "date_of_review": "7 December 2017"}

We would have never ordered to drink, but since the waiter offered it, we agreed to taste it: result was \u00a316.50 added to the bill for three tiny shots of non-ordered digestif.

However what really made us upset was the service by the owner, as the waitresses were actually nice, but the owner treated us like a nuisance, asking us to leave an umbrella outside despite the fact it was dry and us explaining that to him, saying he \"didn't want a wet floor\". What was just an impression was actually verified when we asked to take away the left overs from the dinner. He just put two plastic boxes with lids on the table and left them there with a bag, told us to do it by ourselves. At the moment I want to point out that the restaurant wasn't busy, waitresses were not busy, considering this and how we got treated other times there(basically urging us to leave the table, which is why this time we booked the table!), we won't be coming back any time soon.", "date_of_review": "12 February 2019"}

An unexpected treat; definitely the best Turkish restaurant I've been to in Britain. Every single dish was fresh and flavourful. We shared the mixed hot platter for a starter, and discovered a couple things we'd never had before and loved - imam bayildi (a spicy tomato aubergine sauce with peppers & garlic, which we liked so much we had seconds), and mucver (breaded fried courgette with feta & parsley). For mains, I had the chicken casserole, and my husband iskender. They came with rice & a really nice dressed salad of greens, tomatoes, green onions & pomegranate seeds. Portions of everything were very generous. I also tried a glass of the Turkish red wine; not had before & was pleasantly surprised. Throughout the entire meal, the service was impeccable. Staff were attentive and friendly & the owner checked to make sure we were enjoying everything. We ended the evening with some Turkish coffee, which came in lovely, pattered metal cup holders (which the little white ceramic cups sat in) & saucers, with intricate matching metal lids keeping the coffee warm. I'd not seen anything quite like them before & thought they were quite special. Ambiance was great as well- decor was very nicely done, lighting was soft but well-lit, the place was busy but the noise wasn't too loud, and there was room between the tables. Patrons were a mix of couples, families, a range of ages and cultures. All-in-all, I was blown away with the place - you wouldn't necessarily expect that level of service and quality food from a place on an unassuming high street in the suburbs of Northwest London. I was actually so impressed, I wanted to share my experience on Trip Advisor and had to sign up for an account just to do so! :P", "date_of_review": "10 December 2018"}

People looked smart-casual and everybody was having a great time. The staff were attentive and friendly bringing our drink orders quickly-the food orders were also memorised and no mistakes made! We are not big eaters and did not want starters but were brought the bread, olives and dips with our drinks. Our Entr\u00e9es were delicious. We ordered the chicken and lamb shish and a seafood kebab. So much food. You could taste the charcoal flavour from the hot coals. The presentation is to be commended. Sprigs of mint and dill, scatterings of pomegranate seeds and fresh salads come with the dishes. So much colour and freshness. This is true Turkish food. We also shared a mint chocolate chip sundae, again with lovely presentation which makes Yaprak a cut above other local restaurants serving similar desserts. We really enjoyed our evening eating in. By the time we left there wasn't a spare table. But there were about 4 wait staff all working hard and efficiently and the Manager was serving too.

Avoid the squid and polenta. It came out and was nothing special at all and sadly left a greasy after taste in my mouth. I could only handle a couple bites.  The Ragu was really nice and one of the best I have had in London actually however the service was quite slow, after ordering wine it took 15-20 minutes for it to arrive..  I do have to say our waiter was so lovely and was kind enough to take the squid off the bill after I expressed how I felt about it.  I would visit again to give this another go as I feel it was just one of them off busy nights so want to experience it again ", "date_of_review": "5 February 2019"}

The bread had a strong seasoning on it which made it unpalatable for us. We asked if we could have plain bread without the seasoning but they said it was not possible. I am vegetarian so we asked if we could have the starter platter of 5 mezze but change one fish dish for vegetarian. The waiter was extremely inflexible and said they would just give us more of the other 4 but would not swap. All of the cold mezzo items including hummus are charged at the same price of nearly \u00a35 so I really don\u2019t see why this was so difficult.

The tall waitress is slightly aloof and there seems no flexibility whatsoever in the menu. A friend has intestinal disease and asked to swap an accompanying side for another but apparently this is totally inflexible even when the restaurant is totally empty.

It is a nice comfortable restaurant however when full it is quite loud and crowded as they have packed in as many tables as physically possible!  I was sat at a table of 2 however we were very very close to the table next to us which was a table of 4 mature ladies so as much as we could hear heir conversations I am sure they could also hear ours!  The staff were very friendly and accommodating with taking orders and I would personally recommend the Halloumi!  My boyfriend and I like a variety mix so thought we would order one of the platters. The chicken platter didn\u2019t offer the variety we wanted so went with the family platter that feeds 4-5 at a mouth watering \u00a346. It also comes with a cold mix meze which neither of us eats so if you are a fan of the different cold dishes it is good value for money but for us we didn\u2019t want to be restricted so ordered something else from the starters menu and were told very quickly they couldn\u2019t change the platter even though we didn\u2019t ask!  Food was served pretty quickly but was definitely freshly cooked. They offer different meat on the platter to that of others we have tried. The ribs were great and there was plenty of them but the lamb Shish and chicken shish consisted of two pieces of meat each! The kofte was ok but the chicken kofte equivalent really wasn\u2019t very tasteful at all however the chicken breast on the other hand was lovely!!  I like my salad with Turkish Cuisines but their salad was a slight different take as it mainly consisted of rocket and chopped tomatoes! So nice and fancy but not to my acquired taste.  By the time we were ready to leave it was packed with barely room for the staff to move between the tables and they were incredibly slow at giving us the bill and then taking the payment.  That said they are a new business and are still probably getting to grips with the busyness as they also offer take away options so we\u2019re dealing with the restaurant as well as take away orders.  An ok first experience but not sure we will be rushing back any time soon. ", "date_of_review": "22 October 2017"}

We could have 6.30 or 8.30. 8.30 is much too late for some to eat (you wouldn\u2019t get food until at least 9.00!). We took the 6.30 slot, which meant we had to leave by 8.30. It took a while to order and get the food, as they were so busy, so it was fairly rushed, especially for a largish group and you\u2019re always conscious of the fact you have to leave by 8.30, which means you can\u2019t completely relax.

Overall the food was very nice but the service lacked any feeling of customer attention and there was no friendliness or intimacy that can often make for a good dining experience.

It is a lovely restaurant with genuinely friendly staff - nothing is too much trouble and despite it being very busy they always have a smile, unlike some restaurants where the staff are just civil and its like a chore to serve - every member of staff at Yaprak are nice (dont know all their names but a special mention to Memhet and the female server whom we spoke to mostly) Food is delicious - large portions but very good quality meat and beautifully presented. Only negative point is that tables are too close together - if they had a few less tables it would be more spacious otherwise I cannot find any fault.

I should have realised how the experience would pan out as when booking I was told twice during the telephone call \"you will have one hour and 30 minutes\". On arrival we were told the same thing. We sat down at our table which was far too close to the tables next to it and appeared to be situated in some kind of thoroughfare. Every time somebody walked past they brushed past me as the gap was too narrow - very irritating. Various staff waited our table which we found confusing as some were asking us the same questions as others and duplicating work. They all seemed to be in a great big hurry to get our order and get us out the door. We had only been sitting down for 2 minutes when we were asked what we wanted to order. Well, actually we had not had a chance to even look at the menus by that point! The whole system seemed to be geared up as a conveyor belt designed to move people along as quickly as possible. My friend had three rather large pieces of chicken on her plate and the minute she dared to put her knife and fork down to take a sip of her drink a waiter pounced asking to take the plate when she was nowhere near finished! The ambiance was not exactly relaxing due to people brushing past my chair every 2 minutes and the sheer volume of noise! The food however was absolutely fantastic and I couldn't fault it! Compliments to the chef! Yaprak is obviously a popular, well-attended local restaurant - the food is amazing so it's not hard to see why - but they seem to have become a victim of their own success, hence the annoying time limits and over-attention at tables. The 3 marks given are for the food as it really was second to none. Maybe a take-away next time?", "date_of_review": "25 May 2017"}

Just a short summary: YES I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and if I have the opportunity I will come back. Service; more then perfect, friendly Food; one of the best I have ever tasted. Thank you for this great experience Yaprak!", "date_of_review": "20 April 2017"}

We ordered the set menu for 3 and were surprised to be given complimentary dips and bread followed by yet more dips and pitta as part of our menu! The dips were tasty but we were disappointed by the meagre, rather tasteless bread and had to ask for more as only a small quantity was served. I would have expected fresh, or at least warm ,pitta but this was cold and dry. That aside the main course consisted of a lovely salad and plenty of meat. It was excellent value as were the drinks and the serving staff were pleasant if very busy. Whilst we enjoyed the meal it was very hard to hold a conversation as we were under a speaker and the ' music' was turned up far too high. We were also squashed up to the table behind which meant getting up and down from the chair was difficult. This restaurant is a great addition to Eastcote and with a few tweaks would be perfect.", "date_of_review": "21 April 2017"}

Sorry but no - either you take the worst table in the whole restaurant or ...sorry. We have never been treated so terribly by any establishment.

A good start, booking OK, drinks quickly proffered and soon delightfully quaffed. Booking is essential and merited, for in an otherwise quiet Eastcote, amidst sleepy suburbia, Yaprak was nearly full. The tables are not, in my opinion too close together, but commensurate with the reasonable pricing. Three courses, four people, two rounds of drinks and the whole experience less than a ton. The food matched the place and even sought to upstage. Tender lamb, beautifully cooked as was the chicken, king prawns, whitebait, fresh squid, rice and other tasty comestibles. Little touches of gratis, flat bread and dips, water with the Turkish coffee, Turkish delight that had seen Istanbul ,not Bournville. We will certainly go again. What a find in soporific suburbia.

This restaurant was highly recommended by friends and the reviews were excellent and bookings are advised. The food and service were very good and good value. Unfortunately the evening was spoiled by the front of house manager. We booked our table for 8.00 and were not informed when booking that the table would need to be vacated by 9.30 (even in top West End restaurants you get 2 hours!). If we were informed when booking we could have made a choice of whether to go or not, but to be informed when you arrive is unacceptable especially when it is your Saturday night out. What is more unacceptable is when the manager continues to argue the point for 5 minutes, he clearly has never heard the concept of the customer is always right. As it transpired the table appeared to not be required at 9.30 after all, so the whole unsavoury argument was totally unnecessary.

The waitresses were perfectly pleasant but the manager was rude from start to finish. In short, I can think of few worse experiences I have had in a restaurant (unwelcoming when we arrived, insisted on taking our main course order even when we were not yet ready (despite the restaurant being empty and not having given us much time to look at the menu), right through to not even making eye contact or thanking me when taking payment) despite us having been polite throughout. We also saw him taking a similarly rude approach with the few other customers there were there. It is simple, if you are miserable and don't like people, don't work in customer service.

Nice touches include decent wine glasses, complementary delicious bread, olives and a dip. I had some houmous to start with lamb, and the houmous was the best I had ever had, not sticky stodge, but moist with olive oil running through it, marvellous ! Between us we had Lamb chops and lamb shish, both were lovely, but the stand out dish was the shish, I have never had such tender lamb in my life - I would go back just for that ! Lovely buzz to the restaurant, and packed solid. My only down point is that for us, one being a wheelchair user, not the easiest entrance to get into, and the aisle between the tables are very narrow so should my friend have needed to use the toilet then that could have been a problem getting to there !

Great location at the top of Queensway connecting with Westbourne Grove.  It is interesting to see how the same type of establishment (Arro's premises have been used as a patisserie by various previous owners for years) can be done so differently. Here's hoping Arro is here for the long term, as on current showing it deserves to be.", "date_of_review": "8 February 2017"}

So we showed up to the restaurant and one of the waiters who obviously didn't understand gluten free was very ignorant telling my girlfriend she could eat anything when she clearly couldn't and instead of getting the manager or chef to come and explain he just huffed and said quite rudely \"what do you want then?\" explaining he couldn't do anything else even though they'd told her family in person and also over the phone they did gluten free food. The waiter obviously wasn't trained about allergens and how serious they can be which I can excuse as I know it's quite difficult sometimes, however his obnoxious and ignorant tone forced us to leave. We were obviously quite disappointed by this as our family raved about the restaurant, this is where the story improves. The next day the manager called my girlfriend and could not have been more apologetic, explaining they had everything ready but this waiter had ruined it completely. We said to train him on the subject but she was adamant it was unacceptable. They asked us to come back and to have a meal on them free of charge to make up for it, so we took them up on their offer. We were treated like royalty all evening, I haven't eaten that much food for a very long time but it was delicious! It was obviously in their best interests to make amends but it was clearly a genuine gesture by people who care, most restaurant owners would have just given up. The chefs came out and ran through the menu with my girlfriend, they recommended dishes to try and just looked after us all evening. I will definitely be coming back and I appreciate the effort the management and staff went through to make amends.", "date_of_review": "10 February 2017"}

Whilst perusing the menu I ordered an Efes draught in its perfectly round 500ml bottle. The set menu had around half a dozen starters and menus all taken straight from the a la carte unlike many places whose set menus have watered down or fewer ingredients. Before my taramasalata arrived I was given a trio of complimentary dips, one tomatoey, the second tzatziki, the third olives as well as warm pieces of pitta bread. So generous was this selection that had I fully indulged there would have been little room for the taramasalata let alone my main of minced beef and potato moussaka itself generously complimented not only by some brown rice but also a mixed salad on a separate plate. From a range of ices sorbets and desserts none more than \u00a34 I chose a coppa rosso, a sort of updated raspberry ripple.

We were also given a delicious rice pudding dessert on the house and it was absolutely delicious.  We will definitely be returning and this time we'll make a reservation and eat in the restaurant.

A bit disappointed there were not more Turkish Wines on the list but there was adequate choice nevertheless. Our food arrived quickly, well cooked, nicely presented and very tasty !

At that point staff member told me that we need to order mains otherwise chef won't be happy. I was so pissed off at that comment. It felt like i should just get up and leave at that point but because we had guests with us we just continued there. After the starters were done I asked for the desert menu at which point the staff member weirdly asked you mentioned that you will order mains after starters. I had to tell him that we were quite full with the starters and won't need mains. Staff member got upset and started saying a few words and after that the service level drastically droped. There was no smile or positive gesture towards us.  At the end the bill was sufficiently higher - about \u00a365 as we ordered sufficient starters and some deserts.  I don't understand why would any restaurant provide such bad service and tell customers to order mains without which chef would be unhappy.

They have introduced a vegan kind croissant its less buttery version plain and apricot jam filled little glazed pastry!

By the time we were ready to go the restaurant was still only about half full so don't really understand what the seating issue was. We were given menus and chose our starters and main courses, whilst waiting we were served with bread (soft and fresh) and some chutneys/yoghurts, all very tasty. My wife chose vegetarian starters and mains and they were both very nice indeed, I stuck with tiger prawns for starter and a lamb shish as a main. All the dishes were very tasty. We finished off with baklava which was the best I have ever tasted. I did mention this to the head waiter but he didn't seem particularly interested. After the little hiccup with the seating, service was good, attentive without being overbearing and increasingly friendly as the evening wore on.

Just when you go in you can feel the smell of the coffee, see the amazing Panettone or Focaccias, or Sorrentina.  One of my favourite coffee is the Jamaica Blue Mountain,for the smell, the taste, flavours are unique and also the colombian coffee.  The other thing that I love from this place is the human side. They have an icredible team of people that make unique and iconic this place in London. Will be difficult to name everyone but Anna and Federica they are an example of customer service and always smile. Also Alessandro and Mateo as they have all the skills in terms of coffee knowledge and they are always more than happy to explain you the singular signature of every coffee.

Being very busy and travelling the world applying my culinary skill's has hampured putting pen to paper, so to speak  I decided to surprise my fiance on her working so hard, so it was a bit of a treat. I decide on Pizzicotto on High Street Kensington, Holland Park. It's close to where I work, and wanted to try the a bit of Italian to see how they fair. No starter's, we ordered two pizza's, a bottle of wine and finished with TIRAMIS\u00d9..  My lady had the Mangia Fuoco and I As alway's the Margherita. The dough was good, the toppings could have been a bit more generous. I can understand Franca manca being a bit light handed, but their pizza's start at \u00a35.95.. The service from the waiters, very good. The drink's, aperitif before the wine were good, didn't have to wait that considering the small restaurant was almost full. Service good...!! What ruined the evening for us was the dessert, the TIRAMIS\u00d9. I brought to the attention of the restaurant manager that I could taste any mascarpone in, just double cream in their creamy cheesy Italian dessert. Their is this dispute in Venecia and Veneto of where it's humble beginnings began. I asked to speak to the owner who was at the sister restaurant two door's away, and he came.. I put forward to him that the tiramis\u00f9 had no mascarpone cheese in it. He argued their was, I told him I'm a chef and I cannot taste it. So he began going into a defensive mode. Did he ask one of the waiters to get a couple of spoonfuls of the dessert to see if I had a good cause to be worried about the mascarpone? NO, he wasn't interested, very arragant and argumentative. Sometimes mishaps happen in kitchen's, chef has no mascarpone, \"make it with the double cream, no one will know the difference\". Yes people that happens. That evening I walked in, and I know the difference.  That is not a good practice of leadership and very bad mannered. Also telling me they were the first to make the dessert in London. San Carlo restaurant in Highgate Hill, North London in 1980 was. That's where it appeared for the first time. Never argue with you patrons, more important never argue with a 3rd Generation Italian Chef..", "date_of_review": "17 September 2019"}

One of the staff was wearing a Timothy Taylor Landlord sweater. My husband presumed this was a Timothy Taylor ale pub. When he enquired, the staff member was nonplussed and had to go away to enquire, only to return with the information The Oaks serves two IPA beers only.  One of the most disappointing parts of our meal was the absent service. We waited 15 minutes for a dessert menu. A second course was necessary as servings are not typically Sunday lunch generous. We abandoned our wait for somebody to return to take our order after 20 minutes.  There were three staff serving today only, with a full bar and full restaurant. That's a tall order.

Even simple fare; my favourite being fish-fingers in ciabatta sandwich with sweet potato fries. The fish is actually goujons of fresh fish, succulent and flaky within a crispy shell. Quality ciabatta, good crust and fresh crumb (I don't know if the bread is made OTP too, but I wouldn't be surprised).

Where we were seated was a nightmare, football in one ear and music in the other. People at the bar were straining to see the football behind us. We couldn't have a conversation as such. We asked to move and because we had arrived early, we were re-seated which we were grateful for. If the pub had been busy we would have been stuck and I would have given this pub a 1* (sorry).

It was a Wed lunch when we went and it was quiet which sometimes doesn't bode well for a restaurant, but it was cosy the music was appealing (a kind of fusion/funk jazz at just the right volume so as to not impose) the fire was roaring,the waitress/barmaid was lovely,welcoming and helpful so we ordered, there were 2 menu's a cheap daily lunch one (6.95 for fish and chips etc which sounds cheap to me?) but we ordered of the a la carte .The food was really very good,the pricing was fair for the quality, the menu was nicely varied for a pub with things like sweet potato fries, halloumi chips, and lots more. One of the things we hate is when the oil used isn't fresh and it 'tastes' on the food, not the case here, fresh crunchy chips, onion rings etc, my steak was cooked just as i requested,and my wife's falafel burger was nicely spicy served with a very nice side salad. If we had a criticism it would be that there was only one vegetarian option of main course, another would be a good idea. Its location on a bend of a road is what it is, if this standard of food and ambiance were served up the road at The Coy Carp you would have to book ahead for a table most of the time.

The complimentary hot cross buns were a lovely addition. Between us we had the mushroom soup which was very generous and hearty, duck pate which was tasty, bread and oils and Halloumi 'chips' (deep fried dippers) with sweet chilli sauce. The service was very good and nothing was too much trouble. For mains we had a range of roasts, the Beef in particular was very enjoyable, along with chicken and mozzarella burgers which we were told was one of the best veggie burgers my Niece had ever had. The portion sizes are generous, the Yorkshire puddings in particular were very impressive. Unfortunately due to this we were all too stuffed for dessert, hopefully if we return I can try the crumble which sounded great. Overall we had a very enjoyable meal in a lovely country pub.

Unfortunately this experience is one I'm happy to forget, are starters of two prawn cocktails served in a small whiskey type tumblers with very few prawns or lettuce, Pattie with two small triangles of bread this not even toasted. This followed by two small portions of fish and chips and four roasts dinners served with pullet hard roast potatoes and no gravy. Although we sent the prawn cocktails back and they came back with a few more prawns the damage had been done , they then brought out different roasts potatoes and the gravy far to late. We then asked for the bill this came to just shy of \u00a3200 upon which I asked to speak to the the restaurant manager a chap called Mickel , he offered to remove the starters from the bill at this point I told him it was not cost it was the day that had been spoiled as its the day in the year that family's make a point of spoiling there mum. To his credit he then removed all the food from the bill and we just paid for the drinks. It pains me to write this review for I have driven past this pub when there hasn't been any one in there and watched it get turned around so I know that they must of been doing something right it's just so disappointing that my wife didn't get the service she deserved on her special day.

My first impression was of another pub restaurant and expected and average meal. But I was pleasantly surprised with the polite service and quality of the food . We had 3 courses of which all were exemplary. My only constructive criticism was that, the restaurant was very cold and lacked character . It was about -2 degrees outside and radiators were just warm. A few candles lit here and there and some better furnishings would take it to the next level .

As soon as I mentioned steak, Steve's told us to \"Come on down, we'll sort you out!\" We certainly weren't disappointed. Nearly 9pm on a Thursday evening and this place was busy - testament to what we were about to experience. Delicious lemon and herb olives, plus bread and humus to start was a great introduction to our 2 big fat sirloin steaks, with a choice of sauce, homemade onion rings, tomato, rocket and some really awesome rustic chips. My mate Chris kept remarking \"I've eaten a lot of steak in my time, but this is right up there!\" and I had to agree with him!! Price was very reasonable, and reflected food, service and ambience of a much more suave restaurant - without wanting to detract from the traditional yet modern charm of the interior and exterior. A decent-sized car park with a couple of outdoor seating areas and a children's play area - you literally couldn't ask for more!

Staff were attentive and friendly with a good sense of humour.  We will defiantly look to stopping here when we pass by in the future. ", "date_of_review": "17 February 2016"}

Started off with Potato and Leek soup....lovely and definitely home made! Then Lamb shank.... sat on a bed of creamed potatoes in a rich sweet gravy......meat fell off the bone! Came with a side dish of peas and purple carrots...very sweet and complimented the meal beautifully. Amazing food and hospitality.

The dessert menu was impressive and we did have trouble deciding on our final choice. Apple and pear crumble with custard and ice cream was a definite winner as was the brownie.

Service was quick, food took about the right length of time to arrive, my steak was cooked really nicely, and no complaints from anybody else. A real plus point as far as I'm concerned, they do sweet potato chips, for me it's worth going back just for that!  Things that could improve it a bit, more customers, for a Saturday night it was a bit too quiet. A specials board, nothing wrong with the standard menu, but if your going to be a regular you want something different from time to time.

We spotted this from the main road, and gave it a go. What a great find, I had a fantastic steak, and the missus had the most awesome lamb shank I have ever seen. From what we ate, and could see other diners indulge in it is clear that this establishment serves high quality meals at reasonable prices. The real fire was a treat, and the staff & locals were welcoming and friendly. It is a shame I was driving, as I am sure the real ale would have been of the finest quality and I could easily have supped a few pints!!

Table was booked for Sunday at 2.30pm, got there at 2.00. Our table had been given to someone else and we were told that they should be finished by 2.30-3.00pm. We were offered a table down at the other end of the pub which was quite shabby and nowhere near as nice as the dining area. Couldn't understand this as there were a few other tables vacant in the dining area which could also have been offered to us. Anyway, we said that we would rather wait for our reserved table and we were happy to get ourselves a drink and wait down the other end in the meantime. We were given a menu whilst we were waiting but then 5 mins later, the same waitress came to take our order. I explained that we wanted to eat in the dining area, not in the drinking area, and she said that she would see what she could do. Finally we were offered an alternative table in the dining area which was very nice. The food was quite good although could perhaps have been better for the price but the service was very good. The desserts were absolutely lovely. I was asked to fill out a feedback card when we were presented with the bill and so I did, and commented that reserved tables should not be given away shortly before the next arrivals are due (the couple who had our original table were still there eating their main course at the same time as we were eating ours after having finished our starters). After our meal, we paid the bill and as we were walking out through the pub door, the manager stopped us. I thought he was going to apologise for releasing our table bit instead he challenged me and said it was our fault for turning up early!

Menu was well priced but unfortunately the house smoked mackerel was off. Soup of the day was an uninspired tomato soup. The chicken liver parfait was divine, really light and served in a little jar on a wooden platter with crusty bread. The goats cheese and mushroom on toast starter with onion was lacking in ingredients but tasty nonetheless. Mains of roast beef was mostly good but was served well done with no choice of cooking as it would have been better served rare or with a choice. Crispy roasties and a nice selection of vegetables added to the plate along with a nice Yorkshire and a hot horseradish sauce, all good. Wines were well priced and there was a good choice of beers and ale. The service was a little hit and miss - menu arrived but waited ages to order. The bill came but again it took a while to get attention to take payment, small things like this should be easy and all the difference. The pub is busy and should do well but the mostly female staff need to pay a little more attention to the customers. It could be a destination if properly managed.

Five plates of incredible food. And earlier this week, my waistband learnt that the hard way. After a painfully long fortnight in the office my editor rounded up the troops, packed us into cars and gave us the postcode to a new little haunt in town. We found our destination tucked away down country lanes smack bang in the heart of Maple Cross. The Oaks. The five course menu boasts a number of delectable goodies, starting with the pumpkin cream, a hunk of homemade bread and a drizzle of basil oil. Oh mama. I could feel my winter blues being quashed with each terrific gulp. If frosty weather means pumpkin cream on tap, bring it on Mr Weatherman, bring it on. My one disappointment? The bowl was just a few centimetres too long to allow my tongue to reach the bottom. Not to fear, friends. I didn't let anything stop me from draining the last few drops. Next up came posh mushrooms on toast, or as our adoring waiter so delicately put it, 'toast of fried wild mushrooms, toavey goat\u2019s cheese and balsamic shallots'. Whatever it was, it was freakin delicious. G opted for the smoked mackerel with roasted beets and rocket. I was pretty smitten with my plateful, but I have it on pretty good stead that it was delicious. The presentation left more than a little to be desired but hey, delicious food means empty plates in a matter of minutes, right? As soon as our plates had been whisked away, out came course number three. It was a pie. Now, if you've stuck with me for the past couple of months, you'll know that I like nothing more than a big chunky pie topped in flaky, sumptuous pastry. This little pie was not like that. This little pie was very different indeed. This little pie did not go home, or to the market, or eat roast beef. This little pie got my petticoat in a bit of a twist. Stuffed with water chestnuts, stilton and leeks, it was unlike any other pie I've had the pleasure of polishing off before. It was creamy but light, a little bland but with genius textures. I don't think I'd order it again but either way, I ate every last crumb. Still reeling from the undefinable pie, I was distracted by the smell of rich beef stew wafting from right under my nose. More food. Stew, creamy mash and glazed carrots. It did exactly what it said on the tin, warmed my cockles, made my tastebuds tingle and filled my tummy. It was the kind of food that makes you feel proud to be British and/or give up your day job to become a pitch fork wielding farmer. It was just one spring of rosemary away from me grabbing my wellies and riding off into the night on a tractor. After desert was served and respectfully demolished, of course. Whenever I look at a desert menu there are three words which my I'm drawn to. The first is chocolate. The second, caramel, and the third, salt. This little tart had been teasing me from across the room. Soft chocolate, pecans, vanilla ice-cream and salted caramel sauce. What a beautiful hoebag she was. Suitably stuffed and unable to move, we laughed, drank and shared stories until our tummy's could take no more. We made our way back to the cars before hitting the hay (by this I do really mean bed, the farmer career dream was nothing but a distant memory at this point) and sleeping it off. I would strongly recommend getting your toosh down to The Oaks and checking out the delicious dog-walkers pub/restaurant with a gourmet twist menu. The five course banquet is priced at a ludicrously fair rate and you can check out your options on their website.

The Oaks was recommended by one of our members as she had recently eaten there following the new management and refurbishment. A test run proved more than satisfactory and the welcome given by the manager Maciej was lovely. He and his staff were more than happy to cater for our individual idiosyncrasies, even though there were 27 of us. When we arrived, the restaurant was very Christmassy, with a log fire burning to one side. Our table was set out lengthways and set beautifully. Our meals had been pre-ordered and prompt at 8pm we sat down for a three course dinner. Service was good, the food was excellent and the waitress/waiter was more than attentive. Our whole evening went off without a hitch and included a visit from santa and a silly reindeer who had ample parking outside for his sleigh! The atmosphere here is great and manages to combine a local pub and a first class restaurant without losing the personal touch. You want a nice place to go in comfortable surroundings - this is it.

However I always take the time and effort to drive to the Oakes to enjoy a fantastic meal with the service to match.  Yes I agree that a weekend can be busy as it is for most pubs especially when the sun is out and yes they might of got it wrong and made a mistake.

She retakes our order. A further 20 mins go by when she apprears again and tells us that they dont have the starter we ordered. Now an hour into our visit and a little pushed for time we decided to skip starters and just have mains. We wait a further 30 mins for mains when the same waitress tells us that they havent even started to cook our food. At this point we left having wasted an hour and a half of sunday afternoon.  You might think we were unlucky. Except the table of four next to us wished us good luck when they left. They arrived at 1.30 and finally completed their meal at 4pm.  With service this bad I have serious doubts this can survive as a business. My advice is to try somewhere else if you only have a few decades of life left. ", "date_of_review": "9 March 2014"}

This equates to \u00a327.00 a bottle, of \u00a39 for a 250 mil glass, the bottle price was around \u00a317.00, I am sorry for moaning but this is ridiculous. Most Indian restaurants charge between 4 & 7 for a large glass of house wine.

It was noisier than we would usually like, but the acoustics meant that we could still hear each other easily.

Even a table of 4 that arrived just before us, had their full meal and drinks, paid their bill and left and we are still waiting for our meal. We finally attracted the servers attention and he said our mains were just coming. Another 30mins go by many others being served and yet still no food and the wine now finished. Again we asked the server and again he said our mains were on their way and he continued bringing food to other diners! Finally at 8pm we had enough and spoke to the 'manager'. Even whilst we were complaining to the manager the server walks past with meals for other diners, but not us!!! No explanation given as to what happened to our meals so we left. Luckily a McDonalds nearby and we availed ourselves of their table service and efficient serving of our food. Well done to McDonalds for feeding two hungry people.

I wondered whether the term \u2018Cafe\u2019 would mean it was of lesser ambiance or quality of venue than the Brasserie, but it doesn\u2019t seem to mean that at all. This was a true Ivy. A friendly welcome, we had a nice seat by the window. It took us a while to get to the menu as we were enjoying our G&Ts and all was fine. I had a dish I had not had before in an Ivy, tempura prawns with salt and pepper prawns. I would question whether the batter was really able to be considered tempura however it was really very good indeed and I will be choosing that option again. I the had the salmon and smoked haddock fishcake on a pea and herd sauce with a soft poached egg on top. I have had this a few times in other Ivys so I knew what to expect and it was as good as ever. The problem with the Ivy menu for me is I find it so difficult to decide whether to have one of the dishes I had before, which I enjoyed, or to try something new. I can recommend quite a bit on the varied menu. I think there really is something for everyone here. Wine and then another G&T this was a relaxed, long, lunch and throughout the service was good and friendly. I think they were ready to make sure we were able to have a \u2018work\u2019 lunch in an hour but our very friendly, and efficient, waiter soon got the idea we were in no rush.", "date_of_review": "12 September 2020"}

There was nearly nothing on the menu, when we complained the waiter he said that it was the chefs fault because He didn\u2019t expect the turn out of the evening, even though all reservations were made in advance. All that was left on the menu was the most expensive items which we didn\u2019t even want. We stayed as it was our anniversary and we wanted to make it special. We then asked the waiter if we at least could get complimentary cocktails or money off the bill due to the ivy not being up to standard. He stated he was going to ask his manager, however, we saw him do a lap around the restaurant and came back to say that unfortunately they would not be able to do anything . We then complained again at the end, the manager was rude and demeaning towards us for no reason at all. We explained that we did complain to his other employee but he didn\u2019t care and told us to just have a nice evening. This is really not good enough. We come to the ivy in Richmond a lot, this was so disappointing and by far the worst experience that I have ever had at a restaurant.", "date_of_review": "10 July 2020"}

Casual, relaxed, and affordable, Kalamaras is an everyday sensation. We stopped by for dinner, and were immediately struck by the charm, efficiency, and enthusiasm of the staff. The service here would not be out of place in a Michelin starred restaurant. But how did it taste? In short: fantastic. The house red is fruity and smooth, the olives are juicy and very moreish, and the tzatziki and hummous are unapologetically bold. For the main, I opted for the recommended Athenian Moussaka. With a crispy top and robust structure, I was delighted by the layers upon layers of flavour. It was, at times, a bit too rich, but the lemony potatoes and accompanying salad provided a nice acidity. It\u2019s a big portion - possibly a bit too big - but it\u2019s definitely worth the indulgence. On the whole, I really enjoyed Kalamaras - and look forward to returning to try the rest of the menu.

And the restaurant staff were just super friendly and enthusiastic. We thought they were the owners of the place at first, they took such pride in the restaurant and the food.  For dessert, they even went above-and-beyond by bringing not just the greek yogurt and honey the menu promised, but a sampler of bakalava and two other traditional greek desserts. And then the waiter even brought us shots of Ouzo as an apertif. So cool! (I ended up drinking half of mine-- not as bad as I had feared, as I'm no fan of black licorice.)

Today we sampled delicious and surprisingly refreshing menu at this cosy family friendly restaurant. It\u2019s not your standard pizza/ pasta joint that gives Italian cooking a bad name. Meridionale is a place where you can taste authentic southern Italian inspired dishes with a twist.We aren\u2019t great drinkers but we had a couple of glasses of a perfectly good Prosecco. To accompany our drinks we sampled plump and sweet nocellara olives and an innovative seaweed dough balls complemented by chili dip, bursting with flavour ! Then we shared bruschetta \u201ctricolore\u201d with three different toppings: tomato, aubergine and brocollini, served on delicious crusty bread , and one of \u201cstars \u201c of the show : runny in the middle burrata served with aubergine, courgette and tomato caponata, match made in heaven ! For mains we had traditional southern pasta ,very popular on Amalfi coast, called Scialatielli ,with seafood. This pasta is like nothing you have ever tried before unless you had been to Naples, it\u2019s like chunkier more substantial tagliatelle , dough is made with flour, olive oil ,milk and pecorino cheese ,very satisfying. We also shared a mixed grilled fish dish which included super fresh sea bass fillet , juicy king prawns and baby squid . The portions are generous and we were quite full but we had to sample the famous southern Italian dessert cannoli siciliani , crisp sweet tubes filled with ricotta based sweet cream , and of course we had to try tiramisu , which blew us away! Many Italian restaurants serve a sorry version of this traditional dessert , but Meridionale takes it to a different level , it\u2019s light , subtly buzzy and not too sweet , heaven ! And I\u2019m a person who doesn\u2019t normally do desserts . The restaurant is cosy and informal, and there is a lovely patio at the back which in the summer must be really popular . The owner Enzo was there and he made sure everything was perfect and everybody was happy and well attended to . Staff are friendly and well informed, atmosphere chilled . It will be many happy returns for us , for sure . Thank you Enzo and special thanks to the chef for his skill and dedication.", "date_of_review": "23 March 2019"}

We had our table booked for 3:30 on arrival we were made to wait for our table for 15 minutes. At no point a waiter offered us anything to drink while we wait. Eventually when we were seated and placed our orders our starters arrived fairly quickly. Unfortunately, this is the only positive thing i can say about our experience at La Casa, from here it was down hill.  40 minutes later we had to chase our main, which was served 5 minutes later. At no point during our meal we had any servers approaching us to check if we were ok or needed anything else or to offer drinks. After we finished our mains we ordered desserts immediately. However after further 40 minutes late and unsuccessful attempts to flag a waiter we decided to ask for the bill. When we tried to complaint about the waiting time, the rude waiter had told us what do you want we are busy it's mother's day! I told him not to be defensive and all he needed to do was to apologize he started being more aggressive and raised his voice. Needles to say we won't be visiting La Casa again and we'll be sharing our experience with our friends to ensure they won't be dining there either.

It was all the extras too- the place is just so so pretty, beautiful decoration everywhere and the tables are laid and set with such care and attention to detail. We all got our own teapot each (with lovely little cosies) and with the scones had a pot of cream and jam each, not one tiny one to share as some places palm you off with. We also had a lovely little gift bag each with magnets and a tea bag to take away. The service was fantastic too- all of the women were lovely, checking if we were okay and chatting, we were there for a while but didn't feel rushed in the slightest.

It is a bright modern restaurant and we were quickly provided menu and asked what water we wanted. We chose a bottle of white and a bottle of red and they were quickly provided. We were asked very quickly if we were ready to order and we said no, in fact we said no twice so I think they got the message. We like to have an Italian in both food and timing, slow and relaxed. If you are in more of a rush though I guess you would be pleased. I had my usual test dishes of an Italian, Palma Ham and Melon starter and Penne Arrabbiata main. They were both good and up to the standard I expect to ever go back. Everyone else enjoyed both their dishes too. Service was good and had soon matched our timing without issues. Very good choice of wines at reasonable prices.

Restaurant was empty except for one other table. Seated straight away and orders taken soon after. So far, so good besides a small mix up when someone requested sparkling water and had still poured into their glass. Three in the group had ordered the burata, one without ham. Three dishes arrived - all with ham. When we tried to explain that one shouldn't have any ham, the waiters were completely confused to the extent that we just removed the ham by ourselves. For main, two of our group had pasta - it looked like a very generous portion and they said it was good. The other two had pizza which wasn't really great - very thick base and not at all what you would expect in an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant. The dough was so thick I couldn't even finish the pizza. We finished our mains and then were asked by about three different people if we wanted coffee or dessert - no consistent service. The final laugh had to be the waiter announcing \"s'il vous plait\" as he placed the bill on the table. Bizarre service and extremely average food.

Unfortunately this summed it up perfectly.  Positives. The staff are excellent. Really nice. Friendly. Attentive. The place is charming.  Negatives. The food is very mediocre, if you have a missus that just enjoys curry flavoured food then no doubt she would love it hence the high rated reviews.

That is the only review of mine that had not made it to the site. Hope this second attempt meets with a better fate. So here goes.... The food was a mixture of pre-cooked ingredients heated up in packaged sauces - utterly lacking in flavor, freshness and taste. The curries arrived before the bread and we had to ask about four times and wait for about ten minutes before the bread finally made its appearance - and it looked suspiciously like a frozen fare that had been heated up.

We were not disappointed. Service was attentive without being intrusive, and the food was of a high standard. The menu is very extensive and very good value for money. We all enjoyed our food - my go-to is Chicken Saag/Palak and it was full of flavour; I have often been disappointed at other places. One of our party had the Vegetarian Thali which was very substantial! The food took a little while to come but not over long, and they were busy. One of the staff came to reassure us that it was on it's way - we didn't even ask! Drinks were replenished promptly as needed. The icing on the cake was the service really. Staff were very friendly and you could see what a good relationship they had with customers, many of whom must be regulars!

The menu is better than most - more varied. I had the vegetable thali, and my son a Chicken dish. The food was delicious, well favoured, well presented, a really tasty treat. The food warmers on the table seemed a little old fashioned, but actually I rather liked them. I've since been back with my girlfriend, not a curry lover, but even she enjoyed it.

The garlic rice had the most whole/rough chopped garlic cloves that I have ever seen in such a dish and it was very welcome, they added texture and taste. The effect on the breath the next day was epic and kept troublesome co workers at a distance !! (you have been warned) The Sag Aloo was more Aloo than Sag but that is a personal preference , it tasted fine with the potatoes being cooked to perfection. The Chicken dish was well cooked with a good balance of spice in the sauce with lots of bright green birds eye chillies added, just how a jalfriezi should be, allowing you to eat as many (or as few) of them as you choose. The chapatti was warm and soft (sometimes they can be like cardboard) and the bottled Kingfisher beer was ice cold. All in all a very good dining experience made slightly surreal listening to the background music being played which was 100% 'Westernised' ..not a Sitar in sight ! Nothing wrong with it , its just unusual (in my experience) not to have 'Indian' music being played while dining in this type of restaurant. All this at a very reasonable price in a friendly atmosphere. Try it sometime.", "date_of_review": "17 February 2015"}

The place to sample Italian food at its best is undoubtedly La Casa in Weybridge. I have been going there a few times each year for a very very long time. It is always a huge pleasure , not least for the affectionate greeting one always receives the moment you walk through the door. Although the items on the menu are always delicious and I would say typical of Italian fair, it is a pity that they do not offer a tiny bit more on the less exotic side of their menu to cater for guests who might like something more mainstream. This is more of an observation than a criticism . They also have a delicious wine cellar which I am sure has something to suit every pallet. So, whether you are planning lunch or supper there, you are sure of a great time and often it feels as though you are right in the heart of Italy because it is a firm favourite of local Italians from several miles around which has to be a good sign surely. My reading of that is that if the Italians think it\u2019s good, then it is good. Enjoy!", "date_of_review": "6 August 2018"}

No cutlery or glasses and a menu placed in front of us. Why did we stay? Eventually we were asked did we want a drink?

My lady and I were not really all that hungry for some reason so we had a main ( a lobster bisque arrangement that tasted and smelt very well and went down a treat. The wine as you would expect in an Italian restaurant was of very good quality and went very well the main course, it obviously went some way towards my lady ordering a desert which she really enjoyed, we will be calling back in the near future.", "date_of_review": "17 September 2016"}

I ordered the sea bass, however, the portion was minuscule? Two small fillets, only half that I received the last time we visited.

Regrettably this visit was even worse.  The atmosphere is odd, with bright spotlights, outdated decoration and noise seems to reverberate around the restaurant.  We ordered our wine, some bubbles and a red wine to start to breathe. Unfortunately the table was so warped the red wine fell over when the waiter put it down, spilling all over the table and our bread and olives. We were moved tables but the bread/ olives never replaced. No apology at all from the manager on duty. Our food took a long time to come, both our pasta starters were Ok, but nothing special given the price. My Fillet stake arrived under cooked for a medium, and my wife\u2019s stuffed chicken had the same tomato sauce as her starter!! It seems to be basic Italian cooking by numbers with no flair or real quality. No one asked us how our meal was and the waiter saw I Ieft a third of my steak, but said nothing. We decided to cut our losses and skip desert.  We are desperate to find a good local Italian, but this restaurant is definitely not for us. I normally love writing really positive reviews, but we were so disappointed twice now, that we feel our opinion needs to be viewed. I think we will stick to the Queens Head which is now offering such lovely food and much better service.  Sorry but in 2018, this just is not good enough in our opinion.

The starters were fully appreciated by us all and the wine was reasonably priced, served chilled and of a good quality. Then the highlight of my evening was the swordfish main course.

I would also choose the table next to a window as it is a large restaurant and could potentially get quite dim away from natural light. Final touch of being given a panatone as a leaving gift (we visited on Christmas Eve) was a nice surprise. ", "date_of_review": "24 December 2015"}

Service was good and we were able to get a table even though I only phoned a couple of hours before going. Food was just above average, even allowing for the hair in the olives and bread! The problem we had was as follows. My partner wanted the the steak with mushroom & red wine 'jus', unfortunately it came with mash potato and seasonal veg; whilst she wanted chips and spinach. We asked the waiter if this was possible to which he said he could swop the mash and chips but would have to charge for the spinach. I'm sorry but if you can change one at no cost why not the other? To compound this they then charged \u00a35.95 for one of the smallest amounts of spinach I have ever seen. Also it was sold as sauteed which my partner said was unlikely. All in all an OK meal but I really don't understand the spinach episode. Would I go back? Possibly.", "date_of_review": "6 January 2016"}

Take, for example, the scialatielli a'Puveriell (a Neapolitan carbonara), which tastes very good and has a bit of a twist on the Roman variety with which we are more familiar - here the Southern way is to serve it on a stubby version of spaghetti which shares the plate with the sauce rather than simply being a vehicle for other flavours. For some this might seem very heavy; for others it is preferred. I was not very hungry and even less hungry after I had stuffed my face with the most compelling strips of bread baked in the pizza oven and dipped in olive oil. I settled for a sensational burrata served on a delicious chilled salad of grilled vegetables. The others had salads and scialatielli - good but not to everyone's taste. The service is charming. Attentive, amusing and generous. It is a simple, modest space but it was bubbling on a Monday evening. Go there and enjoy it.

It's become a favourite restaurant. We've always enjoyed the excellent quality of the dishes and wine which we've ordered, and we've become accustomed to how busy and bustling the restaurant can be. Sometimes there are slight delays and glasses aren't refilled as quickly as some might prefer, but this never spoils the meal. All the staff are friendly and efficient but what makes it for us is that the owners seem to work hard to remember and acknowledge previous guests as well as greet new ones. As other reviewers have noted, it's not the cheapest but the prices are very reasonable for the quality. Well worth a visit!", "date_of_review": "28 February 2015"}

We booked the table a few days before just to be safe. On the day of our booking we were rung by the restaurant to say that the table we had been allotted was by the door and would maybe be an annoyance, if we made our booking 30 minutes later we could be guaranteed a better table. Of course we agreed to this. When we arrived we were placed on a table well away from the main door but we noticed that no tables were actually by the main door. Our table however was by a patio door which opened out onto the road. Very soon we were aware that this door was used by the smokers to nip out for a crafty fag and we were subjected to a stream of constance traffic all nicely bringing a cigarette smell back to our noses each time. This was obviously the table we were offered to be moved from ... very nice On top of that it took 45 minutes to bring our menu, a further 30 minutes to take our order, we decided starters was probably a bad idea and went straight to main, which took a further hour to arrive and it was nothing special. All i can say is we skipped sweet and went home after eventually paying the bill feeling utterly discussed at a restaurant that had worse service than a restaurant myself and my wife visited back in the 80's the day before it was shut door by environmental services and believe you me that was bad. Admittedly it was a bank holiday weekend but this is never an excuse to treat your paying customers in this way. We will never return here again .", "date_of_review": "8 April 2015"}

I can only praise the owners and staff for their superb efficiency in dealing with a large and sometimes rowdy group. The service was fast, professional and friendly. Not too complicated and overdone menu, which was ideal for our needs. I personally chose the seafood salad starter and it was beyond impressive in quality and quantity with delicious octopus, squid and mussels. For the main I went for one of the specials, which was a rib eye in a white mushroom sauce. The steak was cooked to perfection, a good size and very tender and tasty. Everyone was very, very happy with their food. Some people had desserts and they were also well received. It worked out at \u00a334.23 per head including a lot of drinks and a 10% service charge, which for the standard seemed very reasonable for the area. We compared out evening with other colleagues who had eaten in other venues and there were moans about high costs and slow service from other establishments. So, I would recommend this restaurant and would go back again. The venue is very homely and basic and welcoming.

After being shown our seats we were eventually asked what we would like for dinner. - we had pre-ordered a bottle of champagne but this was not opened until just before we received our starters!!. Finally after the first course eventually arrived, which was LUKE WARM, we were left to our own devices. No-one asked if we were happy with our food or poured any of our drink for us. We had to serve ourselves all evening. As did the table next to us. When I told the waiter who eventually came to speak to us with the bill, that the food had been luke warm, he was annoyed that I had not told him previously when I had the food. I explained that I could not get anyone's attention and I did not want to wait any longer to eat as I was very hungry. He said he would take off the price of starter, but this is not shown in an itemised bill as you only get final price on receipt. So am not sure whether in fact he did take it off the meal price. The restaurant was extremely noisy and busy with parties, So all in all, the service was reflected by being very very poor and for the price of the food the service certainly did not match up to high prices of the restaurant!!

The service staff have to learn to be polite and professional.

Not enough staff to serve us, they were always passing us by in a hurry, when we got someone to serve us it was done at the speed of light, but how funny when the waiter got our money(we paid cash) he thought that we left a tip for him, he never left our side, for sure waiting to get some tip, we did not bother to give him any, also when we got outside at the parking to get our car he was there having a smoke break. No offence with so many tables to serve, as the place was packed why have a break and not do yr job? There was a guy that had to get up and go and pay as his table had to wait and wait, another couple waited forever to get their desert order in, my daughter asked for another coke and it did come. We saw a mistake made in a order of food at a big table. Were is management on that place? they said they were training staff, sorry why not do so during the week and why not hire more people so that fiasco of service and waitresses running around giving bad service will not happen again? The desert was awful, the cheese cake tasted like nothing and the bannofie pie had hardly any caramel, a total rip off, expensive and it felt like we were eating air. I wish the owners would take our money seriously and ensure that the service would improve. I wasted my money and my time.", "date_of_review": "15 September 2015"}

I should have listened to myself although in fairness we have friends that rate the place highly.  I just don't get it, we went on a midweek evening and whilst it was not busy it was also not empty but there was no atmosphere at all, I was fine as Mrs C is great company and we never stop talking, but others around us sat looking at the walls in silence. I found it strange that for an Italian restaurant they choose to play more Spanish style guitar music. We were greeted by the door after 30 seconds and shown a table, I say shown a table as we were not shown to to table, quite simply the waiter walked over to a table and placed the menus down and walked of before we had even seated, no offer of initial drinks although he did return a couple of minutes later with a wine list. The restaurant itself is quite bland, simple white walls with a few generic pictures of Sunflowers on the walls, which would be fine if the staff generated a lively Italian vibe, unfortunately they did not. The actual menu is okay, not exciting or creative but okay, hardly the essence of Italian Cuisine as they like to call themselves. To start I chose a daily special being a Crab and Avocado Salad, the Crab was tined and tasteless, the Avocado was nice, but the typical marie Rose Sauce on the side was simply dated. Mrs C went for Tuna Carpaccio which was very bland and a poor choice. Main course was better her Fillet of Sea Bass was good, and my Chicken in White wine, asparagus and mushroom sauce was edible, although the potato base it was served on was pasty and did not seem to be freshly made. Luckily wine in an Italian is not really down to the venue, ( unless in a Italian Vineyard ) so the middle of the road Pinot Grigio was a saving grace and smoothed of the rough edges of the meal. Although we arrived at about 9pm, by the time we had finished our main meals the rest of the diners had left, and the staff appeared to be in close down mode, so we skipped dessert and coffee and left. Price for the food and wine described above was over 80 pounds, so whilst not the most expensive meal around it was also not cheap, nor really value for money. So will we be back................err NO", "date_of_review": "2 October 2014"}

I have travelled a lot to America and as a result am reluctant to eat steak out back home as it is generally inferior but more expensive. La Casa is one of the few exceptions to the rule as the quality of its meat is excellent. I would recommend the fillet steak or veal chop to any self-respecting carnivore.

It was recommended by the taxi driver! We had a fresh crab and avocado starter, it was a special at \u00a310.95 so we decided to share as this was more than we usually spend. We were brought side plates, and the portion was definitely plenty for two. You also get bread and olives as you arrive, which from what I recall are complimentary. We then both had steak one ribeye and one fillet- both cooked to perfection with salad and fries. For dessert we shared the cheese platter with a selection of 5 amazing cheeses. We had two glasses of wine each, one large and one small. The bill came to \u00a383, which was quite steep for us on a random Sunday night, but for the fantastic service and quality of food, it meant we relaxed, took our time and really enjoyed the whole experience together! And I think for \u00a383 it was worth that... It's the kind of place that makes you feel like you are on holiday and brings back fond memories! I will definitely be back.

La Casa has changed hands since and so we weren't sure what to expect but it was good. The restaurant was full on the Saturday evening and I am so glad we booked in advance. The parking is still a nightmare but there is easy and free local parking within two minutes walk but important to know if you have any disability. The staff were extremely friendly and Italian which is always good because it's so disappointing to be served by Brits or Polish people in an Italian restaurant. For starters my wife and I both had ' Insalata tricolore' which is the best I have had anywhere in the world and really generous portions and for main course again we both had the same 'Filetto ai tre pepi' or a fillet steak in a peppercorn sauce, however, probably not the best I have ever had. The steak was OK but not among the best fillets we have eaten, there could have been more sauce and the fries were good and a good quantity. Bit of a mix up in that one of the other couple we were with wanted a portion of fries but they didn't appear but we did get a portion of mashed potato that we refused to take. The restaurant has a lovely ambience and even though it was full it wasn't overly noisy and they obviously attract a nice class of dinners. So my scores are; restaurant 10/10, staff 10/10, food 8/10, overall dining experience 9/10, well done La Casa overall.", "date_of_review": "23 February 2014"}

I didn't fancy any of the starters (soup of the day was \"fish\"), so I asked if I could have half a portion of the gamborini allo zafferano (main course at \u00a319.95) this they agreed to and charged \u00a312.95 (a bit mean?). This was excellent and I can recommend it as a main course. Main course was liver for me and fillet steak with mushrooms in a red wine sauce for partner. The liver was good, but I've had better. The steak came with two fillets larger than would normally be be served as one in other restaurants - I had to assist partner in eating it. I'm not sure the accompanying sauce is the best way to present this dish. The gourmets will be pleased to note that the vegetables were \"al dente\", I sent them back to be cooked.

The mobile terminal would not connect and hence declined the card, the waiter tried it a few times and it would not connect so the alleged boss tried. This is when the service took a turn for the worse and he insinuated it was the card not the machine. To prove a point we gave him another card whilst a member of the family went to the ATM with the original card for cash. Needless to say the second card did not connect! I advised the boss that this was a connection issue and he was so rude. I have never encountered a boss so rude. He was volatile and told us it was not his fault he wasn't inside the machine and that it was not the machine as it was fine 5 minutes ago! We were paying a bill of \u00a3175 and paid in cash as their machine would not work! May I add this was the same card that we tried to use in the first instance.. Plenty of cash on this card! To cut a long confrontation short we ended up requesting our tip back, leaving the restaurant with the boss telling us that he didn't care if we returned or not. Let me assure you we or any of our friends or family who use the restaurant at least twice a month will never return.

Out of 4 people, 1 had an acceptable meal.  One of the side orders was deep fried zucchini - I've had this elsewhere and loved it so was looking forward to it. Sadly, the thick batter (I was expecting something more subtle at a restaurant of this supposed quality) was uncooked and tough at the same time. This was sent back immediately. The other meals were the Swordfish (which was nice), a pizza with uncooked dough, and the Veal which was so crisped at the edge the knife couldn't cut it and uncooked in the middle - I didn't think that was possible.  That's when the real trouble started.... having realised that the zucchini wasn't the only issue I asked to see the manager who arrived looking annoyed. I showed him the uncooked pizza, explained the zucchini and asked him to try and cut the veal.  Instead of apologising and offering alternatives, he said 'how dare I question the food', his '40 years of experience' meant he knew better than me - very probably but there was no denying the food was not cooked properly. I said the food was not up to the standard I expect and he said 'I don't want people like you in my restaurant' he then walked away with the plates.  His attitude was so threatening that i had to ask my dinner partners (two of whom were young children) to leave the restaurant as I didn't want them subjected to what I feared might come next. He returned with the bill and shouted that he would take the pizza and the veal off the bill but that I had no right to complain in his restaurant - in 35 years (5 years less than 5 minutes before) I was the first to complain. I asked him to sit down, stop shouting at me and discuss my concerns. (I wasn't really expecting to have to stop an owner from making a scene in his own restaurant) He initially refused and then sat down for 10 seconds before deciding he preferred to stand over me threatening to call the police - not sure why. At this point I told him not to speak to me in that way. He then grabbed my shoulder and said 'I want you out - I don't want people like you in my restaurant if you can't afford it you shouldn't be here' The bill was taken away, and i walked out.  As I waited in the car park for the others who had walked down the road, he came out and shouted the same again.

The rest of the over priced starters were acceptable but nothing special.  Our mains consisted of:  Escalope of Veal in breadcrumbs for \u00a317.95 - The Veal was very lacking in flavour. Grilled calves liver and bacon for \u00a316.95 - my wife liked this. Two of us had mature fillet steak for \u00a321.95. Both steaks were very small and 'bashed'. One was overcooked and one was underdone as ordered. One of us ordered Rack of Lamb for \u00a323.95 and arrived too rare. I had pan fried cod fillet with baby spinach, borlotti beans and cherry tomatoes for \u00a317.95 - This arrived with a revolting tomato sauce, not as described with JUST cherry tomatoes. The actual cod did not have a crispy skin as it should and the cod itself was tasteless.  We did complain and eventually the owner in kitchen whites came to our table in a very confrontational manner. He was arrogent and incredably rude with that attitude of \"How dare you complain about my food - I am a master chef and we have a reputation as The Best Restaurant in Weybridge'. He eventually told us to 'F**K OFF'. His obvious contempt for customers was astounding. Please, please, please take my advice and DO NOT USE THIS RESTAURANT. IT IS OVERPRICED, POORLY COOKED AND YOU ONLY SERVED TO ENCOURAGE THE ARROGENCE OF THE OWNER AT THIS PRETENTIOUS restaurant . There are other far better restaurants in the area where you will be treated with respect and get better food and better service from more appreciative restaurateurs.", "date_of_review": "14 April 2013"}

At this point the arrogant owner came over and said basically, 'how dare you say my clams were off, I know my clams and no one else has complained!'It's very intimidating when you have a man like that looking down on you and telling you off! My husband wasn't impressed either as this was said when he wasn't at the table. Coward. I'm so glad I returned the clams otherwise I would have been ill like the other reviewer!

It all started reasonably well with an easy reservation on a Saturday afternoon...which should have been a warning considering every other restaurant in the area was fully booked. The restaurant itself is well presented and laid out..off street parking which is a bonus. The vibe when we walked in was oddly tense although we were greeted well enough, albeit a little over the top sort of Italians on speed..that's when it went bad. We were seated by a waiter who was making sarcastic wise cracks about how I was dressed and flirting with my wife. I may add yes my wife is very attractive and I was wearing jeans and a collared shirt ?? I guess he was trying to be funny and engage us in some kind of banter..we just laughed it off first time around although it didn't go down well ! The general staff vibe was almost stressful being rushed to order, we sent 4 different waiters away in 10 minutes ..yes better then no attention but this was nuts. The menu selection was pretty good and we ordered ..the starters arrived very quickly and were basically not too bad but the last straw was when Mr Comedian arrived again and promptly made more sarcastic comments about my selections to my wife ! - Bruscetta and some Scallops ..umm it's an Italian restaurant ? I told him to go away and his comments were not welcome ..he disturbed our hopefully quiet romantic evening so I complained to the owner and we walked out in the end.

When it comes to pizza, I always prefer the Napolitan compared to Roman style, and Mediolane has a great deal of variety in pizzas. Yet I always go for the classic \"Italian flag\" coloured margarita to compare. I believe there is some room for improvement in Meridiolane though... ingredients were magnificent but the dough was a bit stickier and bit more burned than expected and compared to other Napolitan restaurants in west London (like my favorite Berdotti and L'oro di Napoli).

We had the calamari as a starter to share (chewy and cold) and a veal Milanese and Risotto with prawns as a main. The veal was hard (as if it had been frozen before) and the risotto was watery (?!?) with the prawns not cooked through.

This report is the collation of two visits the second visit madfe because the first had been so bad.. La Casa sits in a prominent location on the site of what was once the very best Italian restaurant in Weybridge. On the retirement of its owner the Casa Romana became La Casa and thats where the similarity ends. What a shame.. On arrival with four friends we waited at the door till one of the staff eventually approached us and I gave my name for the booked table ( I assumed the delay was because they appeared busy) We were then passed to another person with a clip board which he scanned repeatedly and eventually having talked to another gentleman we were shown to a location next to the kitchen and on the main thoroughfare to the toilets. Ever feel you were not wanted? We definately felt that as we were not known that we did not deserve proper attention.  Service was slow and poor the food was barely passable my pasta had obviously been kept heated under some form of heat as the top was hard and slightly burnt , the Rare steak ordered came well done and vegetables were all overcooked. On top of all that you could not drown your sorrows due to prices they were charging for wine.. We did not bother with a sweet or coffee. What is an amazing thing was the staff all projected a superior attitude had a habit of ignoring you if you tried to get their attention. In my opinion they should all be ashamed of themselves What a disappointment we will certainly not going there again and you do so at your peril.", "date_of_review": "8 January 2013"}

Our waiter recommended a wine for us, which was absolutely on the money, just perfect for us.  For starters, I had one of the specials, the ravioli porcini, and my friend had goats cheese. Both were delicious, although there was rather a lot of goats cheese ;-).  For mains, I decided to go for the la casa pizza - one of the best I've ever tasted !

I had always driven or walked by but never actually made it through the doors. However, I must say, I am so glad I eventually tried this restaurant! The staff are very friendly and welcoming. We were looked after immediately from walking through the doors; and the service continued to this standard throughout our whole meal. We had bread and olive oil as an appetiser which is a lovely extra touch whilst we were deciding on the menu. We went with quite simple pasta and pizza dishes, but much better than the \u2018American Italian\u2019 restaurants everywhere. This felt and tasted much closer to its roots of Italy.  We had a very relaxing meal, where we stayed at the table for a while after we had finished eating and still had the service for drinks - none of this \u2018would you like the bill\u2019 to clear the table and push us out.

Unlike some reading the reviews; the decor was ok and the ambience very good. Being a Saturday night it was very busy, but that you\u2019d expect. Quite a comprehensive menu with some additional specials. We were a party of only 2, my husband and I and we were shown to our table without delay. I chose the breaded prawns from the specials board and my husband the soup, both were delicious. For mains my husband had the veal with spaghetti; very generous portion which my husband really enjoyed. I couldn\u2019t decide between a traditional pasta main or the rack of lamb chops, after discussing with the waiter I was sold on the lamb. Now, I did really enjoy the lamb, tender as described with fries and some perfectly cooked veg on the side, however I only managed to eat 2 of the 4 chops. Unbeknown to the waiter, and why would I say, I had been recently ill and this was our first meal out since I\u2019d felt better, but alas, my appetite wasn\u2019t back to normal. To say the waiter was \u2018not impressed\u2019 is an understatement, he made it quite clear. I did say I really enjoyed the food but was unable to eat it all. My husband had dessert and I agree that didn\u2019t come across as home made, described as a souffl\u00e9 but looked more like a sponge, that said, again my husband enjoyed it. Now my other niggle, I\u2019d spent the evening noticing that with the bill came complimentary limoncello, oh good, I like limoncello so was looking forward to this, but no, not in our case, our faces clearly didn\u2019t fir, , and before anyone says they were ordered, no they weren\u2019t as some guests didn\u2019t drink them.

Admittedly they removed from the bill.. but it was just disappointing when one had looked forward to something/being reliable etc. and the photos etc and other reviews showed good-looking pizza. Would have chosen something else if had known, but didn't fancy sitting around while something else was prepared. It should really not have been served in the first place.

Visited on a Sunday for the first time in several years for a lunch with my in-laws, hubby and two teenage children. Booking is advisable, as although there were many tables free when we arrived for our 12.30 booking, it soon filled up, including many large birthday celebration tables. It is clearly a thriving and popular restaurant. The menu currently online is the same as that currently available, and really has something for everyone. A fantastic range of meat, fish, and vegetarian dishes of all Italian styles, including, but not remotely limited to, a wide choice of pizza and pasta. As a longstanding vegetarian I found the choice extremely adequate.  Tables are nicely laid with glasses, white tablecloths and white napkins. They are also not too close together. Service is friendly, enthusiastic and efficient from all staff, with a lot of humour that you need to be ready for! They are also attentive, with glasses being topped up regularly. On the table already are bread, olives (conveniently already pitted) and olive oil to dip, which was nice. We didn't order starters. We visited on a Sunday, on which there is, in addition to the main menu, a set menu of starter, main and dessert which has a roast as the main course. This isn't available to see online as the waiters bring a blackboard to your table to show you that day's options for it - there were around four starter choices and the usual roast choices. For fellow vegetarians, there was no vegetarian main choice on this but we were not going for this menu anyway, but if anyone from the restaurant reads this, you could easily introduce a Quorn fillet or similar as the 'meat' part. My in-laws both had the 'Gamberoni allo zafferano', which is a signature dish which they have had previously. This is an attractively presented dish of king prawns with a delicious saffron-infused risotto, the risotto part of which I tried and loved. Hubby had what translates as a 'three pepper' fillet steak, which he enjoyed - again, I tried the sauce and it was superb! Refreshingly, not only fries or mash, but a bowl of seasonal fresh veg, in this case beans and broccoli, are incuded in the price of the meat and fish dishes. Many restaurants now require you to order veg and potato dishes separately, at extra cost, and it was nice to see them being included here and in ample portions. My teenagers loved their Margherita pizzas (my son was able to add olives to his on request), and I loved my 'Vegetariana' one. They were very large, very tasty and helpfully pre-cut, although they were very easy to cut anyway - lovely and soft, and just the right thickness. Desserts were had by four out of the six of us. The dessert menu is not listed online, but there are many lovely options. Hubby and his dad enjoyed the apple crumble, which comes with cream or custard, my mother in law enjoyed the pannacotta, and my son agreed when he sampled it, and my son polished off some sort of choclate cake. Portions for these are large compared to many restaurants. There are also simple things such as icecream and sorbets. Looing at those parties having birthday meals, the staff were very welcoming to them and having balloons and banners up was no problem and the staff helped do this. Children were welcome, and although I didn't see any very young ones there, I would imagine they would be too, but this is not the sort of place for those parents who let their children run riot around some restaurants! The only downside for me was that as the place filled up, especially because of the large birthday groups, the acoustics became worse and it was harder to hear across the table, but this is a problem in many restaurants these days because of the lack of soft furnishings. A lovely meal and we would happily return.", "date_of_review": "9 March 2020"}

The restaurant was busy and initially the service was good with our order taken promptly and drinks and starters arriving in good time. However after this everything slowed down. The mains took 40 minutes after the starter had been finsihed and once the mains were cleared away then there was no mentionof the dessert menu. Eventually we gave up and asked for the bill. We had to ask for this four times and eventually it arrived 30 minutes after the initial request. In total we were in the restaurant for 2.5 hours for starters and a pizza which is totally unacceptable. I realise the restaurant was busy, however there were plenty of staff and so I put it down to poor organisation. Reading other reviews service seems to have been an issue for a long time.

'Chocolate s'mores brownie Gooey chocolate & marshmallow brownie with vanilla pod ice cream, Lotus biscuit crumb and salted caramel sauce' As the picture shows there was no marshmallow to be seen in or out of the brownie - no lotus biscuit crumb and the sauce was chocolate.

A friend and I started our night here on Saturday 1st August. Coronavirus protocol meant we could only book a table for two hours. We had been delayed and I was worried the bar staff would give our table to someone else so I phoned the bar en route and explained we were running late. The lady who answered was very understanding and said it was fine. We arrived 15 minutes late and sure enough, had no trouble getting in. We were shown to our table in the beer garden and the barmaid explained the new online ordering procedure. One of us needed to scan the QR code on the corner of our table with a smartphone and this would direct us to a website where we could place our order. My friend bought the first round and he said the instructions provided were accurate. About five minutes after he placed our order, our drinks were ready.  When it came time for me to buy the second round I discovered that the beer garden in the Pitcher & Piano is a black hole for O2\u2019s 4G signal and I couldn\u2019t get any internet connection at all, which highlighted one big flaw in their online ordering system. It did occur to me that ordering online would present problems in other contexts as well, for example if the customer did not own a smartphone, or had forgotten it, or the battery had died. Luckily, EE seems to have a better 4G signal in that square of Richmond so my friend bought the second round too. However, hopefully Pitcher & Piano have a back-up plan if customers find that they cannot order online like I was unable to. My friend also grumbled that the website on which you order your drinks does not give you an option to remember your debit/credit card details, meaning you have to enter everything each time you make a purchase, which could be irritating if you are spending the whole night there. My friend sipped a Jack Daniel\u2019s and Coke and I swigged a cold bottle of Heineken Zero, one of my favourite alco-free beers, which I was glad to see they serve. We enjoyed the sun while sitting and talking. However, we both soon realised the chairs are extremely uncomfortable. I frequently shifted in my seat trying to find a comfortable position that was not there and the hard metal back of the chair actually bruised my spine, which is still painful as I write this. My friend had been playing golf all day and the chairs hurt his already sore legs.  About halfway into our booking, we smelt the pungent aroma of cannabis. Was it someone smoking on the riverbank? No, the smell was too strong for that \u2013 it had to be emanating from inside the beer garden. We realised it was the group sitting two tables to our right who were openly smoking a joint. Clouds of sickly-sweet smoke drifted over us and many conspicuous over-the-shoulder glances were thrown by us and other customers in the direction of the offenders, however they continued smoking and the bar staff did nothing about it. It seems that, on this night at least, the Pitcher & Piano had a look-the-other-way policy towards smoking weed on their premises. I suppose this would appeal to some customers but it would surely deter others so it\u2019s worth bearing in mind when planning your visit.  As the clock edged towards 8pm, the beer garden started to empty, which made me wonder why we\u2019d only been able to book a table for two hours because it looked like there would\u2019ve been room if we\u2019d have wanted to stay for longer. However, by that point we were both sore from sitting on the uncomfortable chairs and wanted to move on anyway.  This was a disappointing visit to what is usually one of my preferred bars in Richmond. More comfortable chairs and \u201cweeding out\u201d people smoking cannabis on the premises would\u2019ve made it better.", "date_of_review": "3 August 2020"}

Took a fair while before anyone approached us to invite us in and get us seated, although I probably could overlook this under normal circumstances. Sat down, ordered drinks, then ordered some food about 5 minutes later at around 6:20. Then, the long wait...  Almost as if we\u2019d been forgotten about, it wasn\u2019t until 7:35 before someone on the P&P team spoke to us again. And funnily enough, when they did, it was to ask if we had ordered anything. Food arrived around 7:40, but by that point, it doesn\u2019t matter if the food is good or bad because it\u2019s never going to be worth the hour and 20 minutes it took to actually get it.  Can tell some of the staff don\u2019t be to be there, can\u2019t blame them because it was a sweltering evening. But I didn\u2019t think before arriving that I\u2019d want to be somewhere else that badly also, just to get something to eat. I understand service can get busy, but we\u2019ve been there and to another P&P piano in Hitchin before and had roughly the same experience. Something is fundamentally wrong with how service is done in this chain of restaurants, whether all the chefs are super slow or the kitchen is just too small to serve all of their seats, I just hope they fix it before they become the next casualty of the British high street.", "date_of_review": "11 August 2020"}

Out friends had arrived early and asked for the music to be lowered on account of their table literally vibrating with the bass. When we joined them the music was loud enough to make conversation difficult. Why do restaurants do this? Is it to encourage a quick turnover of covers? The food however was quite good. The pizzas in Franco Manca are good, but due to the thinness of the dough they tend to get cold quickly and also adhere to the plate a little. They could be consumed be so much more easily with serrated knives but these are a rarity in chain pizza restaurants. The beer (No Logo) was good.

Service was slow, plates not cleaned until desserts arrived and cutlery given after food arrived. Not a great experience, would go somewhere else next time in Richmond.

We had visited in the past and were served by helpful and well-trained staff. The food also used to be up to a high standard but things have changed. During the recent visit we found out that the menu has changed dramatically. The dishes seem to be composed of randomly put together ingredients of poor quality. Whereas the starters were up to an acceptable standard, we were not able to finish our mains. Our salads consisted of deep fried fat of beef, overcooked pak choi and whole spring onions. I could still taste the onion 24h later despite only taking a couple of bites of the salad. We complained about the poor quality of our mains, sent almost full plates back but the ownership wasn\u2019t taken and we were charged the full price. The quality of service was also questionable.

I had spoken to the restaurant beforehand to ensure I could book, as they don't usually take bookings. But as there was such a large group of us we were able to book with no deposit.  Every member of staff I spoke to beforehand and the serving staff on the night were so lovely and friendly.  The food itself was tasty, fresh and well cooked. But there is a very limited range. Only a couple of choices of starters and half a dozen pizzas. However, having said that we were told to feel free to mix and match toppings as we desired (for an additional charge of course). There's no choice other than pizza so if you're looking for a pasta or salad this isn't the place for you.  Also slightly lacking in choice were the drinks. Non branded soft drinks and beer and no spirits at all. One of our party wanted a vodka and soda but had to go with wine instead as that's all they had. And we asked for liquor coffee at the end of the meal only to be told they only have rum as they use this for one of their desert cakes.  When it came to desert, again the choice was limited and the one most of us wanted (tiramisu) was sold out. Sad times. But we opted for other cakes instead which were nice. Traditional Italian and homemade.  The prices are very reasonable. Pizzas as low as \u00a36. We all had three courses and several bottles of wine and it came to \u00a325 a head.  I really enjoyed the meal and the excellent service but I'd say this restaurant is better for a lunch or pre cinema meal rather than a special night out. ", "date_of_review": "6 December 2016"}

A style tip for the Manager, dress more formally make sure you meet and greet and don't look like a busker on the underground. All the kitchen and waiting staff are properly attired.

It was literally almost impossible to hear anything said from the other side of a small table and some of the waiting staff were somewhat unprofessional in their antics. Pleasant waiter who explained the options as we had not been to a Franco Manca before, and the service was very good despite the limited options for both pizza and drink. Each to his/her own, but I didn't enjoy the sour dough pizza. It was soggy and salty and with a very limited addition of extra items I found it rather tasteless despite the additional meat. I found it difficult to cut with a knife, although it was easy to masticate and plenty big enough. One choice of lager and one of beer (usual bottle prices) and limited selection of wines at about the usual price for a bottle. However, I didn't enjoy the lager. Overall, despite the reasonable price and quick service it was not somewhere I would recommend and not a patch on the Pizza Express opposite not the 'real' pizzerias I have experienced in Italy although I got the .impression it was Greek oriented?", "date_of_review": "10 August 2016"}

Franco Manca is a great place light, spotless and airy. The staff are really helpful and nothing too much trouble. What really impressed us was the high quality of the ingredients. There are 6 base pizzas and between us we have tried all six. There is a specials board from which you can choose extra toppings - I was greatly impresed with the selection and particularly the pancetta (Gloucester Old Spot pork!) and it would be hard to find anything with greater flavour. The cheese toppings are specially sourced - soft goats curd from White Lake Dairy - magnificent. The Grana (Padana) actually tastes right - another chain on the other side of the road just not compare with their parmesan-style lookalike, although I am a regular there so will not take the comparison further. Fanco Manga's wines are excellent value - they start at \u00a314.95 - we had a great bottle of Barbera at only \u00a316.50. Unbeatable in my book. The pizzas are superb value, most most expensive \u00a36.95 I recall, and the well-sourced toppings range from 50p to \u00a32.

We visited the P&P for lunch, not arriving until around 2pm so thought we'd have missed most of the rush. We couldn't have been more wrong! I understood that as it was a sunny, warm, Saturday of a Bank holiday weekend that it was going to be busy but this seemed to come as a shock to the P&P (even though this had been forecast well in advance!). After some waiting around we got a suitable table but proceeded to wait another 2 hours to place an order for lunch. TWO hours to even PLACE an order as they closed the kitchen to deal with the backlog. Surely there are only so many tables and therefore only a certain number of orders that can be placed?! I can't understand how a pub/restaurant in a prime location such as this could be so unprepared! Needless to say, we gave up around 4pm and went elsewhere to eat. By the way, Bills, around the corner, was very pleasant.  We returned that evening for a friends birthday party and we're equally as dismayed. A warm Bank holiday Saturday night in Richmond on the river and again the P&P was stupidly unprepared. The staff were tediously slow at the bar, we waited half an hour and more to be served and when we did get to the bar literally half the drinks were sold out. The DJ was also dreadful. He didn't play a single song that was recognisable all night which meant that there was no atmosphere to the place.

The whole pub was heaving with people which was quite unpleasant, and unexpected given it was a Wednesday night. It took at least 10 minutes to even get eye contact from a staff member in order to be seated at our table.  We waited a very long time for both food and drinks. Getting our waiter to attend to our table was a challenge in itself. It appears that they are more interested in entertaining regular customers than those they do not know.  The cocktail menu is broad with plenty of choice for everyone. Despite this, the two different cocktails I tried were bitter and quite unpleasant.  The food was mediocre at best, very basic menu which would have potential to be tasty if done correctly. Unfortunately the reality was a disappointment. The tomato bruschetta was soggy and mostly raw onion. The fish and chips was average with soggy batter. The condiments that were served with the fish and chips came with a complimentary film on top which was most off-putting.  Despite the potential for a lovely atmosphere given the amazing views and location, this establishment fell so far short of my expectations. The staff were not concerned about waiting customers, we received no apology after waiting 45 minutes to order our dessert. I feel that if staff cannot keep up with table service maybe everybody should order food and drink at the bar to avoid poor table service.  I would not visit again despite looking forward to the visit. ", "date_of_review": "13 July 2017"}

Firstly, the service was awful. On arrival, I tried to order a gin cocktail but bluntly got told by the waitress that they had run out of Bombay Sapphire gin and I would have to choose something else. When I asked if they could replace the Bombay Sapphire with a different gin, I was rudely told that this was not possible as it would impact the price too much. We had to ask a couple of times for tap water to be brought to our table, when it eventually arrived we had to ask for glasses... and once the glasses eventually arrived they only brought out five (and we were a table of six). Again, it took so long to get the waiter's attention to get the extra glass needed we ended up just sharing glasses!! Food was pretty vile \u2013 I went for the roast chicken which was dry and flavourless. The rest of the party that I was with ordered different food but we all agreed that the food was pretty poor. I guess the food is quite cheap (for London anyway), I wasn't expecting it to be amazing but I had hoped it would be better than it was. I would have probably made a complaint had it not been for the fact that it took so long to get the bill that I just wanted to leave and forget about the whole experience.

My main irritation however was when leaving the bar, near closing time, I walked out and waited for my friends and decided I needed the loo. The bouncer was very aggressive when I turned back not 2 feet from waking though the door and wouldn't let me back in as it was near closing time, and made a massive deal about why he wouldn't let me in, despite the fact I wasn't even protesting. Basically he was trying to look big in front of his mates. I just stood outside and waited for my friends, during which time he let one of his mates back into the bar (who had done the same thing as me) and then mocked me from inside the bar area.

At one point he began cooing at another customer's baby so I presume he though that would be more fun than doing his job. Please note, the mother of the baby was being served already by another waiter at the till. So this guy was quite literally doing nothing by way of doing his job. He also tried to barge passed and jostled me instead of letting me pass first on our way out. So not only unprofessional but simply rude and ungentlemanly.

Ordered Beef burger, Caesar's salad with chicken and Mac Cheese. Seriously, all 3 were below par in quality. Burger was obviously been put together before it was ordered and sitting ready to be taken out to serve if someone ordered it. The cheese has melted \"frozen\" (been melted but went cold you know what I mean), the side of mayonnaise had a yellow overcoat on top (when you leave mayo out for a long period of time, it discolours on top where it has been exposed to air), the coleslaw was disgustingly bland. My Caesar's salad had a handful pre-cut Romaine lettuce that looks like my chickens will enjoy pecking on! It's so soggy, it looks like those salad leaves that has been sitting in your fridge for a few days. Fresh....NOT! Then there were 3 strips of char-grilled chicken on top. It was pathetic. The Mac & cheese came with a garlic bread with Pre-prepared garlic bread that has turned hard and stone cold. The quality of their food is disgusting and extortionate for the price! Management should seriously look into their kitchen & their chef. This is not the first terrible review on their food. It's disgusting!!  Seriously the salad at McDonald's is far fresher and their Big Mac would have been warmer than the \u00a312/dish we paid at this place. So disappointing. And yes, had we known this is their quality of food, then we would have happily hopped into McDo down the road! If you are after food, stay away from this place but if you are only there for drinks and an ambiance and vibe on a fine day, then stay but make sure you get prime seats by the veranda overlooking the river or if you can't then just step out and get drinks from the off license shop and sit by the docks.

The barman said he would need to check if the kitchen could do the food. I then said we had the free drinks too & he said they were all out of the free drinks - which I completely understand as the Ts&Cs on the codes say there are only a limited number of drinks per bar. So, I said we would get a couple of beers instead if the food was available. He went away to check & came over to the table to say that they had food to do for the party downstairs & also were serving a couple of other tables upstairs, so if we wanted food, it would be at least an hour. Needless to say, we had neither food nor beer. Although he was very polite, it was disappointing to be made to feel so unwelcome on such a rainy night.

We have previously eaten here and had a good experience. When we arrived it took a while for us to be acknowledged, then a waiter eventually greeted us and looked up my reservation, and asked where we would like to sit - inside or outside. I had requested the conservatory in my reservation email, so we said inside and were taken back up to the bar area and given a table that hadn't been cleared. The waiter took away the crockery but did not come back to clean the table or give us new cutlery and menus so we got these ourselves. As we were upstairs, it was not table service which was disappointing. There was only one member of staff at the bar and unfortunately 3 out of 4 of the meals we wanted were not available. Then 3 out of 4 of the drinks arrived promptly, the 4th arrived 10 minutes later. The food also arrived fairly promptly but the jerk marinated chicken was just plain breadcrumbed chicken with no seasoning or sauce, and the mozzarella and avocado brioche was cheddar instead of mozzarella on a plain roll rather than brioche. The parsnips that came with the roast beef were uncooked and inedible. We felt we'd been ripped off but had already paid and the staff were not available to talk to, so we left and had pudding and tea/coffee over the road at Bill's - met with friendly and quick service.

My side dish of buffalo mozzarella and cherry tomatoes; on my life contained only 1 cherry tomato cut into quarters, with a few olives!

In these days every Tom, Dick and Harry are developing old pubs into trendy and stylish Restaurant Bars, whilst this P&P is simply worn out, dirty and really grotty. We headed to the Riverview Terrace from which they have cleverly (stupidly) actually managed to block any actual River View with high hedges all round the terrace. I just don't understand why any operator would consider this sensible. The terrace itself is dirty and the furniture old and worn. They have attempted to re-stain the table tops and the wood stain has run down the table frames. Their is a service counter that is in the center of the terrace, but it was not set-up and the staff in the area were just standing around chatting to each other. So I headed to the inside bar service area, which was horrible. The plaster work on the walls was all bloated and crumbly, the paint is peeling and the area dirty and very unattractive, no wonder there were no customers inside. The selection of drinks was restricted and my first choices drinks not available, the drinks and food menus on the bar were grubby and did not entice us to stay any longer than the one drink, although our intention was to also dine.

Staff too busy chatting amongst themselves, saw chefs drinking beer in glass bottles in the kitchen. As a former chef I know that you should not do this (and even if you do, don't be stupid enough to do it in front of customers). Food was not as good as I thought it would be, however: beautiful crust, really nice tomato sauce, excellent lemonade and wine.

Having had a long discussion with our server about the menu and the specials on offer, we were eventually convinced to try the special. Another 10 minutes later (in which time the drinks did turn up) we were informed that actually, the special was off the menu. This left us with very limited options. I do understand that there are limitations on menu availability but we visited this restaurant at 8pm on a Friday night. Surely the management should be able anticipate demand on what is essentially a peak time and ensure they cater for such occasions?

Some are more successful than others, some start well and get worse over time, others like the Pitcher and Piano get better.  Located overlooking the river Thames at Richmond bridge, there has been a recent refit that looks to be money well spent, though the upper floor still looks a bit tatty. The rotunda style dining area downstairs is very pleasant, particularly if it's too cold outside in the expansive walled patio garden.  The important thing is that the Pitcher and Piano has managed to hit the holy trinity of good food at a reasonable price with a decent pint. My wife loves the flatbreads, simple tastes balanced well. I am partial to the codburger (no, really). The sweet potato fries are fabulous, much better than the chunky chips I got with my burger. There's a good selection of well stored and served beers, ales and stout. The wine list is reasonable, but the cocktails are overpriced and underwhelming. Suggest you guys concentrate on fewer types, better done and at a more reasonable price. We will be back soon.", "date_of_review": "2 June 2016"}

However the rest of the \"experience\" was just not worth it. They did not have the first 3 drinks we chose from the menu so we ended up just asking what they had got, a number of customers were very loud which seemed to reverberate around the (smallish) restaurant area, this was added to by music that was just too loud for a dining area leading us to shout at each other to be heard, a discussion across the table was very difficult. Service was very slow, they just did not seem to have enough staff for the clientele, and the staff started to show annoyance if you stopped them to ask for further help.

There were over 6 tables reserved outside for the same name, and then the entire inside also reserved for them. And, upstairs was not open! So we sat at the 10 seat corner table, we were asks to move when about 15 people showed up to use over 50+ seats that had been empty for that time. These people were already sitting in the reserved area with nobody looking to sit down. We argued our case that there was around 15/20 of us and not a single free area as they were all EMPTY but RESERVED, could we not stay in the corner seat. The party next to us did not mind us having a table of theirs as their party was small.  We continued to order drinks and enjoy ourselves. Until we tried to order food. I asked a waiter, Cliff, if he could take our order. He said \"one moment\" and never returned. Then I went inside and asked and they told me it was table service they would send someone out, I told them exactly where we were sat. Ten minutes passed, still nothing. So a friend went and asked if we could order and was told \"no because you stole the seats\". If you had a problem with this then do not allow us to sit there and drink, tell us and we will take our money elsewhere. Do not refuse to serve us food or even worse pretend you're going to serve us then not appear! Appalling.  I have never experienced service like this! The whole time we were there we were very politely ignored by all floor staff outside but the bar staff inside were more than happy to serve us!  No stars.

It's one of these places in summer when it doesn't get dark till late, that you agree to go for a drink after work but after getting a table, the hours drift by in a casual manner and 10pm has arrived before you know it. It does have inside seating but I have only sat inside during much larger events with non menu food so I'm reviewing the only part I know well which is the terrace.", "date_of_review": "4 March 2016"}

You could come here just for drinks, for coffee, for lunch or dinner (i've never had breakfast here but I believe they do serve it...).  One time I visited P&P Richmond and sat outside in their garden area by the river which was lovely. Had a club sandwich which is very tasty, a good size especially as it comes with chips and salad, and very well priced. I've also come here just for prosecco, which is lovely and reasonably priced. And again for tea and sticky toffee pudding which again was great and well priced. On these two occassions we sat in their conservatory area overlooking the river which is beautiful and they have loving fairy-light decorations which are gorgeous in the evening. On all occasions the service has been great and friendly, whether busy or quiet. Definitely recommend.", "date_of_review": "4 March 2016"}

", "comment": "My boyfriend and I came along to the pitcher and piano, hoping for a quiet meal. We arrived into the bar entrance and were ignored by all 4 members of the bar staff. We had reserved a table for 8pm and were expecting to be greeted by someone who would escort us to our table. We eventually managed to get the attention of one of the bar staff who showed us to our table. Immediately after sitting down we were asked to order our food, having not looked at the menu. When we did want to order, we waited almost 30 minutes to find a member of staff to take our order. The atmosphere in the 'restaurant' area was awful. The tables were full of other people who were simply drinking and being very loud, despite there being a bar area upstairs as well as in the entrance. We could barely hear ourselves speaking!  The food arrived fairly quickly, and was reasonably priced and tasted okay. I asked for my steak to be cooked medium but it was more or less burnt. My boyfriend had the duck which, although was a small portion, tasted fine. We then waited a further 20 minutes for our plates to be collected. We weren't offered desert or another drink and so because of this we decided to leave. There were no members of staff in sight and so we had to go to the crowded bar in order to pay our bill. If we hadn't have done this, we could easily have left the restaurant without anyone noticing! When we did pay, the staff member did not ask if everything has been ok or if we wanted anything else. Overall, the atmosphere and customer service was extremely poor! I imagine this place to be decent if wanting just to have a drink but not very suitable for eating. Overall we felt the atmosphere let the place down and with little/no attention given by the staff. We certainly won't be going back! ", "date_of_review": "2 January 2016"}

The menu was reasonably priced and the restaurant itself was lovely with a large outdoor seating and eating area. However we were disappointed when we came through the entrance into the bar area. Not one member of staff approached us, and we were sure that the bar lady and another waiter has seen us walk in. We waited for this waiter to walk past us which is when we asked him what do we do if we'd like to eat to which he replied whilst having his back turned and walking away \"just grab a table.\" We sat down at the only table available indoors which was dirty from the use of the previous customers. Within a couple of minutes of being sat down the same waiter came over and expected us to order our food as if we could read the whole menu in that short amount of time. When the food arrived I was impressed with the size of the steak for the price that it was. However my boyfriend had ordered a burger that comes with regular fries and also an extra side of sweet potato fries. The waiter had replaced the regular fries with the sweet potato ones and we had to ask him to bring out the other fries. I didn't like the atmosphere in the restaurant, there was no music playing, and everyone was very loud around us. We wanted to stay for dessert because from the menu they sounded lovely but I was in a hurry to get out of the restaurant because we were not treated well by the waiter. Would not go back due to the service that was provided for us as paying customers.", "date_of_review": "11 November 2015"}

When the waitress come we ceased the moment and ordered the meal with the drink order.  The waitress even though lovely didn't speak English very well, in turn the drink order was sent back 4 times & my 3 year old who was extremely hungry by this point, pizza was not taken down on the order making him wait until everyone else had finish for his pizza to arrive (piping hot) not a single apology. Just \"a yes yes it's coming\" from another waitress as ours had gone on break.  Even the menu is needlessly confusing for first timers. Especially when your waitress can't help. I can see what they are trying to achieve (recycled glass bottles, shabby decor & everything organic) but it's the simple things they should be getting right. The pizzas are nice but at the end of the day...it's a pizza, to have that many problems on a first visit it's really just not worth another.

Our event was attended by a number of valuable donors and VIPs associated with the charity, all of whom remarked on what a beautiful venue it was. We managed to secure the space free of charge, paying only for food. We had a large buffet of small plates and nibbles all of which were fantastically presented and delicious.  I would highly recommend and certainly visit again.", "date_of_review": "17 August 2015"}

From 2006 through to today Yes I have seen managers come and go (well only a few :) ) You guys have the view, have the staff, have the beers and have the food. Been here every time of the year. Every month I am here. Just ask me I no doubt have a photo :) I had a great farewell party here back in 2010 but needless to say I still live here in Richmond. I guess calling Sydney (Australia) and Richmond (London) home is something I am sure many would love. But that's my life. If anyone is looking at pre-booking a small to large group of friends with good service then I would not hesitate to recommend Marta and her crew. Don't worry Marta I usually get a friend of mine to book for me :D I will be sure to pop in shortly to say hi as I live on a plane/ in hotels around the world somewhere. But I felt guilty that I didn't leave feedback way back when I had my farewell back in 2010. I was here a few months ago and again last week (for a few drinks) and I just love the staff. I guess their training is perfect as it doesn't matter who the Manager is the staff always perform the same. Overall perfect service, good food (for what you pay for) and the staff always \"cool\". I have to add the staff being cool meaning they are attentive but treat you like and individual and something I continue to appreciate. I always open a tab (unless I am there few two or three drinks). Love your work everyone. See you soon. Brad Just call me ninja - I always have someone ordering my drinks and booking my table as I hate to be identified. Especially to you large corporations :) ps. feel free to PM me and I will give you my details so long as you don't reveal me. Yes I live between London , Munich & Sydney.

Arrived on time, the table was ready and looked great, we were first there so ordered drinks at the bar and went over to the table, sat down - table wonky, hate that! Friends arrived ten minutes later, sat down, and so we attracted the attention of the waitress for additional drinks, when the waitress arrived at table she advised that \"the kitchen was closed\", what? \"due to sunny weather, there was a surprise rush, and kitchen was now closed, so no food\"  So why not tell us prior to arriving, this is 215pm on a Sunday after all, not later, its not as though we are beating the chef up at 4pm for food I thought?!... We ordered drinks, bewildered at what to do next, everywhere in Richmond would be busy by now and a table of 7 is difficult to slip in without notice. By 3pm our drinks arrived, thats 45 minutes later than ordered and the waitress advised that \"the Kitchen IS STILL open, but the food would be slow, and there are no burgers left\"....  We have children in our group, and as the waitress was warning us food would be slow we took that as a warning, so we drank up paid our bill and left.

For the sake of a few simple changes this would a fantastic venue. 1 - Why have tall, thick box hedges higher than head height all around the terrace? No-one wants to see hedges, they come in to eat and get the view over Richmond. Once you sit down and realise you can't see a thing it's too late. Completely removes the point of going here when you can't see a thing.  -Suggestion: Get rid of the hedges 2 - The food is fairly standard 'pub' food plus a riverside premium. When the only thing you have to look at is your meal you start to realise that acutally it's not great, and you may as well have walked back up to the highstreet and gotten a decent meal for less at one of the many great places up there  -Suggestion: Reduce the prices / improve the food / get rid of the hedges 3 - Waiting 40mins for bad food didn't make it taste any better when it finally came, and given the lack of anything to look at whilst waiting it meant a new thing in the green tinted hedge world that is the maze was looked at very closely  -Suggestion: Get a bigger/better kitchen/get rid of the hedges 4 - Serving staff were very friendly, and despite being overworked and trying to manage a huge section she did her best. At the end of the meal she was very, very keen that we fill out a review on TripAdvisor, so that is what prompted this review  -Suggestion: If you want tripadvisor reviews, make sure you have got more positives, e.g. get rid of the hedges Wouldn't go back until the hedges are gone. Would go to the White Cross, the Slug and Lettuce / Tesco and then go sit on the grassy area right next door (all those places are next door) and get better food and a view of the river.", "date_of_review": "20 August 2014"}

(Clearly not!) a drink was missing which we had to point out and wait another 10 minutes for (5 drinks, 6 people?) 2 food items that we tried to order were out of stock which we weren't informed about which was just annoying... We also had to more or less grab the waitress to get any further drinks as she was so busy! The outside area was full so very busy but there was just not anything like enough staff to deal with all the customers. I gave this two stars because the waitress was nice and trying her very best but the food that we waited over an hour for was just ok.... More front of house and back of house staff needed!

To say I was disappointed with the service is an understatement. Rocked up to the bar to order, with 6 staff chatting behind the bar, only to be stared at and ... ignored. No other word for it .. ignored.  One waitress in particular, who was cleaning glasses, turned around, looked me squarely in the eyes, then turned her back on me. On another occasion I was told we don't serve at the bar, its table service ... I'll send someone out. So I duly went outside and waited, and waited, and waited. I would still be waiting had I not collared the waitress myself. Yes ... it was sunny, yes ... the staff were probably busy. But call me old fashioned I expect something better. I'd say we averaged a \u00a370 spend that afternoon. Never again. So Joe Public ... if you want an establishment that cares about their customers, just jog on past the Pitcher and Piano in Richmond ... coz you aint gonna get it here !!!", "date_of_review": "8 May 2014"}

The view, atmosphere, food and drink made all in all a lovely lovely night. Food came out on time, waiter was polite and it really reaches the market above your standard pub food but with a much improved customer experience so i can see why people queue for this place. At the end of the meal, the icing on the cake was when the gf had a desert and the cocktail was kindly selected to accompany it by the waiter again. Food was great, drinks even better and all in all delivering to the customer needs. Top job.", "date_of_review": "27 May 2014"}

It was a beautiful day and we thought Pitcher and Piano looked like a really nice place to have lunch by the river. After waiting ten minutes in the hot sun to be seated, we were rudely told by a female member of staff, \"well, if you find a table, you just sit there\". We walked around the overcrowded restaurant and eventually found a table after waiting for a family to leave. We were not greeted but instead had to ask someone to take our order. After looking at the menu I was enticed by a lot and thought the whole menu looked really good. After ordering a simple round of drinks consisting of cokes etc, we waited for 15 minutes until we saw these being brought to our table. I was then informed that what I wanted to order off the menu was out of stock so then had to frantically decide on something else. I asked our very rude waiter what the wait time on food was and he told me 20 minutes. After 50 minutes of waiting, I asked how long our food would be as he said it would be 20 mins. He said \"it will be here in 5mins , i cant do anything about it\" and walked off. After waiting a further 10 mins,mI asked to speak to a manager. Instead of apologising, she explained it was because they had a small kitchen and they were busy. I work in hospitality myself, and I completely understand long waits on food on busy days. However, staff should be quoting longer waiting times, not 20 mins when that is clearly not the case. Also, as a guest, I did not want to hear their excuses, just simply a solution to my problem. The manager said the food would be five mins on top of what we had to wait, and it was brought out soon after. She gave us a round of drinks on the house and deducted a small fee off our bill which was appreciated however it was so small that it hardly made a difference anyway and was not really a sufficient amount of compensation for the trouble we were caused. She spoke over me when i was trying to explain the problems we had. The food was not as good as I was expecting, especially when i had just waited over an hour for it! People who had been seated after us were served their food before us, when we asked to order drinks the waiter said yes what would you like and as we started to talk he just walked off and started to clean a table which i was shocked at! We were on a tight schedule as I had work in the evening, and had I known we would be waiting an hour instead the quoted 20 mins, we would not have stayed. Dissapointed, as it looks like a lovely pub/restaurant with a lively atmosphere to enjoy with friends/family. Never have i experienced such rude staff in my life and most definitely will not be returning there.", "date_of_review": "28 July 2014"}

Did some research on prices for the set menus in the area and this restaurant was definitely affordable at \u00a324.95 for a 3 course meal per person. I was in contact with them a few times before the actual day of the meal to be sure they had everything they needed from us and everyone I talked to was always very polite and helpful. I even had to make a few last minute changes, like a last minute booking the day before, which they were still able to accommodate. At the dinner we arrive to find the table beautifully decorated with crackers for everyone and Christmas Tree in the corner, it looked lovely. The service throughout the evening was impeccable; sweet and helpful staff happy to answer any questions and bring us anything we might ask for. Food was on time and lovely, I myself had flaked salmon, turkey then Christmas pudding. The only thing that was a tiny shame was that lights were turned on at 11pm and we were eventually asked to leave at 11.30pm. We would have liked to have been able to stay and chat and drink, but I understand that this might have more to do with legalities than an actual choice of the Restaurant, so it shan't show on my score for them. :) All in all a lovely evening.

I pointed out we had been waiting 15 minutes already to which she replied, 'we're very busy.' Well done - sunny Sunday in Richmond?? Surprising..  She said she would send someone across to us. We waited another 15 minutes outside. Got up and spoke to two more waiting staff, both of whom were clearing plates from departed tables.(Priorities, anyone?) One girl was quite rude. That was enough. We left. I won't be returning unless P&P figure out a sensible amount of staff for a pub with terrace on the Thames.", "date_of_review": "13 November 2013"}
