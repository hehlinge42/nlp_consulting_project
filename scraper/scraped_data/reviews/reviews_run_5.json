The pizza is freshly made and cooked in a wood fires, pizza oven and arrives at the table, as all good pizzas should be, hot with just a slight browning on the base of the pizza, proving that oven is hot enough. The selection of wines is good but if you just want to drink water, there is no pressure to purchase an alcoholic drink. The coffee was served in a preheated cup, a sign that someone has been taught correctly. My only minor criticism, which reduces this review from five to four is that the menu does not mark the menu with either the commonly used vegetarian/vegan logo.

After changing napkins with the table behind we went for starters and pizza with a glass of wine. The bruschetta turned out to be a slightly toasted slice of bread with some chopped up mozzarella and tomatoes. The white wine was a disturbingly dark colour with a strange taste. Pizza arrived and was actually very good, great base and full of toppings however it was tepid to say the least. My wife went for the tiramisu which liquid consistency left a lot to be desired. Throughout the evening people were going in and out of the office, next to our table, which detracted from the atmosphere.

We were all seated by 7pm, and it took at least half an hour for anyone to come and take our drinks orders. The majority of us had pre-ordered from the set menu but all had to order again as the staff seemingly had no record of that. This was where the fun really started... a dribble of starters came out after about an hour, with some people having to wait much longer, staff not knowing who ordered which item, two people on our table missed out altogether. People were served their second course whilst others hadn't even been given a starter. People waited THREE HOURS for a pizza. People asked FOUR TIMES for table water.  Food on the whole was bland, all swimming in oil and quite clearly rushed, so much was left uneaten and plate after plate was returned almost untouched yet at no point did any of the staff ask us if everything was ok.  No-one asked if we wanted more drinks and we had to keep flagging down the seemingly disinterested and unenthusiastic staff to order more.  The night drew on and we were all getting restless and fed up with the disaster this had turned into (it was a special birthday for a family member with some guests travelling hours to be there!) And by 10.30pm we had all eaten and were waiting for dessert. We asked if it was coming. They said \"on its way\"..11pm rolled by, dessert was still apparently \"on its way\"... We never did get desert. I have no idea why. We ordered it as part of the set menu, but the staff just decided not to serve It?!?!  Due to all the mistakes and appalling service , a member of our party spoke to the management and it was agreed we would receive a \u00a35 per head discount. Fair enough, we thought. However when we paid, we were still expected to pay for the dessert which never materialised!!! I queried this with a staff member who gave me a cacophony of excuses such as: 1) some of you didn't turn up (a few people couldn't make it due to family bereavement) 2) if you wanted dessert you should have said ( We did, it formed part of the set menu we ordered from and you took our dessert orders at 8pm) We also asked thrice and were told it was \"on its way\"... 3) it's your parties fault as some of you didn't order from the set menu (a small percentage of us ordered from the regular menu, which made absolutely no difference as the pre order we made was ignored anyway. At no point did any member of staff apologise for this mess. Looking at their kitchen setup and the way in which they worked, it's clear this restaurant just couldn't handle the sales volume of a party of 20 plus people.  I was hesitant to write this review due to how negative it is, but it's an absolutely true representation of our experience and needless to say, none of us will ever be back again. Four and a half hours is a ridiculous amount of time to wait for a 3 course meal...especially when the last course never arrived anyway! A shambles of an experience, a ruined birthday treat and a wasted journey for many of us. Such a shame.", "date_of_review": "27 January 2019"}

All food is cooked fresh to order and everything is home-made including the spaghetti. Most of the staff speak Italian - and so do many of the regular customers, making for a relaxed \u201choliday\u201d feel! The menu is quite short - in typical Italian style - but it changes seasonally and there is also a specials menu. I had the Parmigiana pizza last night, which had meltingly soft aubergine seasoned with a sprinkle of mature Parmesan - my new favourite pizza. A glass of the excellent Montepulciano and a freshly made mixed side salad (chopped to order) completed my enjoyment. It is also one of the best value restaurants in the area - our pizzas and salad came to less than \u00a320 for two! Strongly recommended.", "date_of_review": "28 January 2019"}

I asked for some olive oil too and was brought Olives as the waiter misunderstood, but that was quickly fixed with a joke \"I can squeeze the olives out for you if you want some fresh olive oil\" so the service is amazing and funny too. Sourdough pizza was simply delicious - nothing to add or subtract from a clearly perfect recipe. Decided not to go for dessert as was too full, which speaks for the generous portion sizes.

Good first impression, modern, spacious, generally nice atmos. More like a city eatery than one in Egham. Seemed to be plenty of staff but I think our waitress was very new to the job . I have no problem with new staff trying to find their way, but she seemed to have had almost no training for what was probably her first night ever doing a job like this. The menu was interesting, with many dishes light on meat or sauces. However the verdict of our small party was the same . Very nicely cooked and presented but a bit tasteless. Mushroom pizza did not taste of mushrooms at all. Chorizo pizza was very light on chorizo and the spaghetti with cod had almost no fish taste as the cod pieces were so small.  To be fair it was probably very authentic Italian, and we are more used to an International Italian cuisine which is richer tasting.

Some might say that I\u2019ve not eaten at the right places, but to me most dishes especially the pasta dishes are generally really bland.  It was my wife\u2019s birthday and she does like Italian food, so I thought it only right to try out Acquolina, as it hadn\u2019t long reopened in its\u2019 latest version. The first impression was that the decor was tasteful and well finished. The welcome was warm and we were promptly seated and provided with menus. Normally I think it\u2019s a big plus point when a menu is small. You know full well when you are given one with a huge selection, that little is going to be freshly cooked. However, the choice here was limited to basically Pasta or Pizza, no separate meat or unusually (for Italian) fish dishes. The result of which meant I was onto a bit of a loser (as I would often go for a meat dish).  I might have gone for the Ventricina e Chorizo pizza but the starter I preferred was the Brushetta ventricina, so instead of duplicating, went for the Ravioli con Cinghiale (wild boar ravioli). In line with the main menu, the drinks menu is also compact and I think that there are quite a few like me, that don\u2019t drink a lot of wine, so only one beer option is limiting, but I do like Moretti, so no complaints. The starter was Ok, and the Ventricina which was described by the waitress as a spicy, spreadable meat, reminded me of the meat pastes I ate as a child. It was also topped with halved fresh tomatoes, which I expected but produced a strange contrast with the warm bread as they were very cold as if it had just come out of the fridge or from outside (and it was a cold night).  I\u2019m sorry to say that I found the ravioli disappointing. It consisted of about 10 little packets which were pale almost grey in appearance on their own (no sauce of any kind) (probably intended) with the minced meat inside. Sadly, it was a bit lacking in taste as I couldn\u2019t have identified the meat in a taste test. The dish also highlighted a common aspect of Italian food I dislike, which was no vegetables to accompany it, and there was no option on the menu. The best part was the Cappuccino mousse desert and nice coffee.  The birthday girl, went for a Salmon and spinach or courgette(?) pasta on the Specials which she did enjoy, though she commented that the vegetable was sliced too thin to be distinguishable.  So overall, the food was well cooked and fresh, it was not a stand out meal for either of us, though it was reasonably priced. There are a couple of other Italian restaurants in the area, I would personally favour though. Having said that, the place was very busy for a Tuesday night. Quite a few people coming in for pizzas to take away so clearly there are more than a few people who disagree with me. I\u2019ve also spoken to other friends who have visited the restaurant, who did like it. The pizzas are apparently excellent, so maybe I wouldn\u2019t be so hard if I\u2019d made that choice.", "date_of_review": "17 February 2018"}
