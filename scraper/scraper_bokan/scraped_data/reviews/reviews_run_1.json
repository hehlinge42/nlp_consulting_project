This was the only positive point I can say about my dinner experience. It was not the first time for me here, I visited the bar and the restaurant few times and this was very disappointing: we went with the tasting menu and between the first 3 courses we waited a crazy amount of time (30/40 minutes) and we then asked if it was possible to speed up a little bit. After our request was taken very seriously and we did not even have the time to finish the following course that we have our plate cleared and the new course on the table. The service was bland, not attentive at all. Clearing the table a waitress dropped a fork on my friend\u2019s dress and did not even apologise! She looked at my friend like it was her fault.  What is more I mentioned in the booking notes, I called and I sent an email as it was a special birthday celebration and I was reassured that they would have presented a celebration cake at the table. We had dessert, we had coffe, asked for the bill.... celebration plate never arrived. This is not what you expect when you pay almost \u00a3500 for a dinner not even in a Michelin star or anything like that.

MCDONALDS STYLE MANAGEMENT & ATTITUDE WITH BETTER FOOD.", "comment": "For about 2 years I've dinned at Bokan approximately 4 times a month and maybe even more. I even chose Bokan for Christmas lunch. I think I could be considered a good, if not a very loyal client. I have never pulled rank, never asked for special treatment and never got stressed out over the placement of the table. I have now planned a dinner for 6 at Bokan next month. For this one time I asked if I could reserve a table of my choice for this very special group of people to experience the restaurant. I was told very plainly and clearly ..... NO, IT IS NOT OUR POLICY! I was even told by one staff member that if I came 2 hours in advance of the dinner at 6pm I could then take the table of my choice because the place would be empty !!!! Now, I have been dining in the best restaurants in the world for about 60 years in fact long before any of the Bokan staff could even spell the word restaurant. The fact that for one time I'm not able to book a table of my choice proves several facts. 1. There is no restaurant / customer loyalty. 2. The management of the restaurant really has no idea what world class dining is about! 3. The customers of Bokan are merely a number and the place clearly caters to the transient diner with whom they need not establish a rapport or a relationship with. Considering this attitude of Bokan I will take my custom as well as my friends elsewhere. We will dine on the special evening mentioned at C. London (Cipriani) where I can book the table I feel comfortable at, where the table linens are as exquisite as the food and the white uniformed staff is smiling, courteous, and care about me ...... the customer. Goodbye Bokan. Your mediocre service will not take you far. By the way, The Ivy In The Park is also a wonderful restaurant that cares about their clients.", "date_of_review": "4 February 2020"}

So I expected the service to be top class too. However, it was very disjointed. On arrival, as a party of 4, we were not offered a drink but given the wine menu. So we selected a bottle of champagne. The waitress took our order for the champagne and the starters and main courses. She sent over the sommelier who recommended and left on the table a claret for the main course. We then waited for a while until the starters arrived whereby we had to chase up the champagne. When it finally arrived the waiter tried to take away the claret glasses until we retrieved them as we also had our claret, long before the champagne. Fortunately we had chosen cold starters. Then during the main course one of the waitresses leant right across the table to pour the jus rather than going around. The service continued rather haphazardly all evening. Overall, the view is lovely, the food is tasty and beautifully presented but the kitchen is let down by a disorganised (but friendly) waiting staff.", "date_of_review": "7 December 2019"}

On Christmas Day I was shocked and upset at the restaurant when I spoke to a waiter and I was told that there was no turkey or Christmas pudding with custard. The waitress gave us a table in the corner facing the window and no one could see our faces only our backs. We received bad customer care, a waiter took our orders he frequently went to other tables and check if other customers were ok and if their food is ok and we were ignored. I had to get out of my seat to go over to speak to a waiter to say that I was not happy with the starter.  I received the crab starter but it was making me sick so I was given the salmon but it was raw and I was unable to eat this.  We ordered the main dish cow\u2019s cheek and chips but when this arrived we ate a small piece but it was slimy and was making us sick. We called the waiter and asked him if we could have another main dish and he said, \u201cNo because the chef cooked it for us and cannot give us another main dish.\u201d My daughter and I only ate the chips for the main dish.  The waitress recommended The Red Seal cocktail, this was served in a long stem champagne glass and not a cocktail glass and it was very sour. We told the waiter that we did not like it because it was very sour. He said he would ask the bar upstairs to make us a sweet cocktail. We were given another cocktail in a black African head glass. I asked the waiter if he could let me know what the ingredients are and if grapefruit juice was in the cocktail. He later returned and said grapefruit juice is not in the cocktail but he does not know the rest of the ingredients because they made it upstairs in the bar.  The dessert Christmas log with ice cream was ok.  The bill was presented in an old reading book \u201cThe Facemaker\u201d. I asked the waiter I have never seen the bill presented in this way. He said it is new.  I rang the reception and spoke to Jerome about the problems we had in the restaurant and that our main meal Cow\u2019s cheek was taken away but we were not offered another main meal and we were starving. My daughter is allergic to all nuts so when Jermore offered fish fingers and chips he later rang back to say that the fish fingers contain nuts. We told Jerome that we would have the Duck legs with chips. We received the Duck legs but it was cold and when we cut inside it was pink. We got the chips later. I was unable to sleep during the night because the duck was not digesting. On the morning of 26/12/19, we had severe vomiting and diarrhoea.  Due to the problems we suffered our Christmas 2019 was ruined.  I am never returning to this restaurant again.", "date_of_review": "27 December 2019"}

The only downside that stopped me from giving 5 star was the wait at bar (although I understood it was busy and mainly time consuming cocktails) and the poor service in the restaurant, while it seemed most of the servers were attentive and lovely our waitress openly complained about her number of tables (just 4) and treated the evening with a distain for her job that reflected in her lack of attentiveness and poor attitude to that table (her general demeanour was of one who didn\u2019t care of those she served, 35 minutes to order food, no drinks offered throughout the evening and when we did eventually order drinks we had to ask another waitress to search for them, which she was prompt in doing) apart from feeling like this one waitress didn\u2019t really want to be there our evening was great.

I mentioned that every guest had their coats in the restaurant, which looked untidy with coats everywhere. .The table we sat was good , since we didn't have any reservation. We chose a bottle of an excellent wine, which we didn't enjoy enough because the waitress didn't have a clue how to open a wine bottle, and cork residues felt in. So we asked for another bottle straight away, as long as we knew how bad is for poisoning the cork.  The food we ordered was nothing special and overpriced. Our fried potatoes, of course, took 40 minutes to arrive. Great for its view and the easy access, but the service needs improvement (not worthy of the service charge you are required to pay).", "date_of_review": "19 November 2019"}

Unfortunately for us the whole terrace had been booked for the evening so we had drinks on floor 38 instead. I had only found this out this morning when the receptionist called to confirm our reservation. This was mentioned on the website but I hadn\u2019t thoroughly checked it. The guy on reception on 38 was very welcoming and perfect for front of house. The bar staff were very friendly and the guy that served our drinks at the table on 38 enjoyed conversation and a joke or two. As we were leaving to go to the restaurant I had half-jokingly asked him whether the tip we gave him included a quick sneak view of the party upstairs he became quite serious and said it was not possible. Maybe I read it wrongly but he seemed a little distant from that moment. At 7pm the restaurant had only 2-3 other tables booked and we were served quickly. Our waiter, Cristian, was a delight. Both the receptionist that called this morning and Cristian checked to see whether there were any allergies and also asked whether it was a special occasion. After choosing our mains and changing one meal there was a slight mix-up. This minor error with our meal choices would have been quickly corrected but we were happy to proceed as presented and the beef and duck choices were delicious as were the desserts. It was a slightly higher price than expected with a main, a side and a dessert each, with just one glass of wine at the table around \u00a360 per head. To me the docklands area has a slightly distant \u2018unreal\u2019 feel to it and there was less interaction with other customers in this establishment than we usually find in The City and West End. This could well change depending on the night and could also be my own personal take on the vibe. I personally love the established feel about more historic areas in London.", "date_of_review": "11 July 2019"}

While the food was generally very good and well presented on the plate, the service was absolutely terrible. The staff was not trained and inattentive. When we asked for the cocktail list, it took forever to arrive, and the waiter could not explain the cocktails and had to get another member of the bar staff. The same happened with the wine menu. Likewise, the waiters were unable to explain certain items on the dinner menu, i.e. what they were or how they were prepared. Everything took an absolutely extraordinary amount of time to arrive. We had endless wait times between courses and long periods with empty drinks. It was very hard to track down the waiters for anything, and we had to physically get up twice to grab one to place an order. It was exhausting and distracting, bringing the mood down.  We were also not served at the same time, i.e. some of us were sitting in front of their rapidly cooling main course while others hadn't received theirs yet. The mashed potatoes that were meant to come with my steak arrived only after I was finished. The same happened to some of our party as well, where side dishes were forgotten or arrived too late.  The food was good, but not outstanding. The \"petit fours\" that came after dessert, were not what we expected: they included cheap tasting jellied sugar candy and by no means \"petit fours,\" as in \u201cdelicate pastry\u201d. I would not recommend the \u201cbirthday cake\u201d that we had pre-ordered. It was not a cake in any sense of the word, but a moussey fluffy mass on a hard crust. It was impossible to cut and portion and unpleasant to eat. We left it there despite having paid around \u00a350 in advance.  I\u2019ve heard the same review from friends who, like us, also live in Canary Wharf around the corner from the restaurant. We could be regulars, but I\u2019m worried to go back and have the same experience. This area is in dire need of some outstanding restaurants, and it would be good if Bokan cleaned up their act and invested in better service staff. The ambience and d\u00e9cor are great, very New York. We just need some New York style waiters. There, you\u2019d get served a 3-course meal and are in and out in 1 hour...", "date_of_review": "8 February 2019"}

They completely ruined my New Year's celebration by miss-advertising their venue.  We emailed them on Friday 28th December to simply enquire if they had more tickets available (No expectations as we know how busy this night is, and it was lastminute.com). Failing to respond within 24 hours (which is quite a reasonable expectation for such business) we decided to call instead. Upon speaking to one of their unqualified staff, they advised us that walk-ins will be available all night upon payment of \u00a350 per person at the door. This does not secure any tables which was fine for us as we only wanted to enjoy a drink and watch the fireworks from up high. We were pretty happy with this result!  To our surprise, today we receive a response to our email (4 days later - excellent customer service I must say) informing us that they are fully booked for the night, but hope to see us another time. How nice of them!  As we live in the area we took it upon ourselves to go there personally today and hoped that this will be somehow resolved as they have provided such bad service. Yet again, we were even more disappointed to see that 1st, the manager who responded to our email was so busy she could not take 5 minutes of her time to talk to us about this. 2nd, 'in their defence' (their words, not mine) the manager works office hours and was not there when we called on the weekend, so I guess misinforming clients should be totally acceptable, especially when it comes to one of the busiest nights of the year when all everyone wants is to celebrate somewhere special.  I was shocked to see such bad level of management and customer service from such a nice establishment. I have been to Bokan many times before this, and have personally recommended it to many of my friends as probably the best rooftop bar in London, but I am sorry to say that I will not longer be doing that. To see a manager who would leave their staff to deal with a problem without facing it professionally, and allow others to take blame for their own poor service. Astonishing.

First round OK, but my wife who asked for a double gin and tonic ended up having to get another bottle of tonic. Sure you will say that you get a lot of gin, but it ruined the experience initially. Long Island was OK,but not stellar.  Then onto the the 2nd. Well, if I had wanted to order Tequila I would have,but I didn't. To say the bar person took it badly is a bit of an understatement. Sure he may have thought he was OK about it, but sadly some of us can read body language, the rolls of the eyes and lip reading the commentary to his friends sat at the bar.

We then finally received the cocktails with our main but since we prefered to drink wine with the main we had to chuck down our cocktails and quickly order the wine before we finished our main. We felt all so sick after our food because everything was rushed and we had no time to diggest or even enjoy our food. The staff was rude to us as well. We asked two people if they could take a photo of us but they both turned us down very rudely because they didn't have time. At least they could have said sorry in a friendly tone that they don't have time but they amlost shouted at us for asking the.  When we confronted our waiter Florian and told him that everything is too fast and that we're having a bad time he just ignored us and told us yes the service needs to be fast and then he left as he didn't like the confrontation. If your table tells you that they're having a bas time then as a good waitor you should at least try and change things, but he didn't.

Beautiful starter, Great entree and the cheese for dessert is to die for. And then a big shout out to our waiter Guillaume. Adviced us a Great wine that both matched the bouillabaisse and the red meat. And he Made lots of little Jokes to make us feel special. And WHERE DID THEY FIND CHEF AURELIE?! Working it in her open kitchen was a joy to watch. Make a reservation! Enjoy the view of London and be heart warmed. ", "date_of_review": "22 November 2018"}

We were shown to a table and were sat for probably about 15 minutes before our order (drink and food) was taken. Around 40 minutes later, we still hadn\u2019t received our drinks, never mind the food. This was despite a couple who came in after us getting both food and drinks long before us. The waiters kept walking past and looking at the table and could clearly see we didn\u2019t have any drinks yet, but did nothing about it. It wasn\u2019t until I got the attention of a female member of staff, who looked to be in charge possibly and mentioned it to her that something started to be done. It was however, an hour, before we even got our drinks and then eventually our food came out. We were charged a \u00a37.25 service charge, which seemed excessive seeing as it took so long to get anything to eat or drink. When the food arrived, it was ok but nothing special and certainly not worth the wait.

They were effortlessly friendly and professional. Nothing was too much trouble. Honestly top notch staff! The food was delightful - we had the three course set menu, including the royal wedding cake. We even got a little bag of token chocolates to take with us, which was a lovely touch.

I ordered two glasses of wine (circa \u00a37.50 each) and was told it was not available and would I like a similar Pinot Noir. I agreed and was charged \u00a325.88 for the privalidge.

Next, the views are amazing. Given I live near Canary Wharf it is intriguing to get a bird\u2019s eye view of the local area from 38 floors up.  Brunch was the usual Londin \u2018unlimited\u2019 (but not really unlimited, since it\u2019s only 2 hours) Prosecco thing! Food was great and enough and staff were super attentive and friendly. Best thing was it was quiet on the day we went... maybe because summer holidays had kicked in and everyone has left the city. Fine by me!!! Stay away, I say.

I had planned a day out for my now Fiance's birthday and to her knowledge it was simply a day to celebrate just that. I however had other plans, that would see me propose to her and catch her completely unaware.  I called the restaurant earlier in the week to ask them if they could help me make this proposal special by giving me access for a brief period of time to the roof terrace. On my first call it did not sound too promising, but after calling a second time, i was told that our server on the day would allow me to view the platform for a short period of time and during this i would be able to pop the question, whilst looking over the simply incredible view of London that The Bokan has to offer.  I was still slightly unsure how this would pan out but i had everything else ready, the ring had been purchased, the after-celebrations were in place - I just needed to keep the surprise under wraps and hope that our server on the day would pull through in helping me to co-ordinate things perfectly.  On arrival we assumed with reading the brunch menu and immediately had our glasses filled with prosecco, to my very nervous delight.  Between enjoying perhaps the most delicious and exquisite 3 course meal i have ever had the pleasure of eating, i found a moment to speak to the manager (our server) in private and discussed my phone calls earlier in the week. He very quietly assured me that he had received my request and after our meal he would offer us both a 'tour' of the bar and the roof terrace, which was not scheduled to open until 5pm onwards.  We finished our desserts and the moment arrived.. my palms started to clam. It was time for me to pull through on my part of the deal. The Manager (who had been welcoming and hilariously funny throughout, might i add) asked my fiance and i if we would like to take a tour, as it was our first time in The Bokan.  He proceeded to take us upstairs and we looked through the bar's windows to see the view of the o2, he then asked my Fiance if she would like to see the roof terrace. She was very excited, as was I.  We got to the roof terrace and the restaurant Manager said to us that if we liked we could spend some time here to take in the views, take photos etc and then left us to enjoy the moment.  My then Girlfriend looked at me with a very puzzled but ecstatic face and asked me why i thought he was being so incredibly nice to us in particular. It was time for me to explain the reason for this...  I dropped to one knee and told her exactly what she meant to me and the rest is history: SHE SAID YES! :D Moments later, after the screams of happiness and tears had ensued, the Manager had re-appeared with 2 glasses and an ice bucket of prosecco in the other.  He congratulated us and assured us that we could take our time and enjoy the terrace for a while longer, as we took in the moment. The gods were seriously in my favour that day, as the weather was magnificent and i really cannot serve justice to the views on offer, with my limited vocabulary. I'd like to thank everyone at The Bokan for helping me to orchestrate this special moment in our lives so perfectly and for going above and beyond.  I recommend this restaurant to anyone and all the better if you are looking to celebrate a special occasion. we will certainly be returning for the brunch in the future and i will be telling the story of how you helped me to nail my proposal plans.  Lastly, i want to apologise again that i was unable to catch the restaurant Manager's name as i of course had a lot on my mind that day, but he was just incredible throughout. We wanted to thank him personally but by the time we came to leaving, he was on his break and not in the building.  I hope the next time that we visit i can see him again and thank him personally for his help that day.  As far as fine dining in London goes, it will be very hard to top the experience that The Bokan provides. Thanks again and kindest regards Lincoln", "date_of_review": "2 July 2018"}

Peter and his team were all super professional, but the Star of the show, and my personal favorite bartender (now friend!) was Liam. If you ever visit this bar, do yourself a favor and have Liam serve you. The guy is a beast at his craft and made some of the best drinks I've had in my life.

We always walk-in and very kind reception ladies try to accommodate and find a table for you. 6 of us went to the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and had an amazing time - bill was \u00a3500 but we had great food, amazing wine. However, let me tell one very important thing - bar team and waitress are always rude (not restaurant's). I never complained to any of the managers but I cannot hide it anymore. The last time I went there - we were 3 ladies and ordered a bottle of wine. The waitress brought 2 glasses only but and I kindly asked to get 1 more glass (obviously). We waited for 15 minutes but there was no one and still didnt get the glass. I went to the bar, no one paid any attention. Then I found the same waitress and again KINDLY asked to get an empty glass because we are 3. She was so arrogant and started to show her embarrassment by saying: \"I told you that I'm bringing it.\" I cannot believe.. I said I cant wait any longer because it has been more than 15 minutes! Then she was putting an order to the till and just ignored me completely. I turned to the bar and waited for anyone to look at me and requested a glass by raising my voice: PLEASE Is anyone can pass me an empty glass? It was such an awkward situation.... After 25 minutes we finally had a possibility to enjoy our wine. Next time I tried to get a recommendation about Riesling wine which they used to have on the old drinks menu. The bartender didn't show any interest in even trying to find my taste. And there is always issues with the bar team and this particular floor - I don't understand why? General manager and restaurant manager need to look into this as I can see from the other reviews - it's happening very often. I think they are all demotivated or tired. To be honest with you, I will try to look for another good place in Canary Wharf on the top floor (didnt try any of other yet) because of this bar and team's attitude as I can't bother anymore - it always changes my mood.", "date_of_review": "5 June 2018"}

Yes, the view is great (assuming you're there on a good day). But the service was painfully slow (took them 45 mins to get our food out after taking orders) and you could tell the staff would much rather be elsewhere. When the food arrived, it was... below average. Not even average. At least, that was the case for me (I had a fried salmon... it seemed like their twist on fish and chips but the flavours were not a good combo, shall we just say). Now if you asked my fiance, the response is more like \"the food was horrible\" because he got a terrible case of food poisoning that very evening, after the lunch we had there. We didn't have anything else unusual that day so that lunch at Bokan was the likeliest culprit. His food poisoning was so bad he had a fever and missed two whole days of work afterwards. Long story short: not worth the pain and never going back again.", "date_of_review": "11 June 2018"}

Arrived at the restaurant on the 38th floor, there was no hostess to be seen for at least 5 minutes and no one had greeted us, so we decided to make our way to the restaurant which is a floor below, once we got there again there was no one to greet us. After wondering around the restaurant a waiter appeared we asked if we could have a table for three. His response was you need to go back upstairs to the hostess desk and they will allocate you a table. Once we got upstairs there was a lady which didn't seem too happy to see. Anyway she brought us to the table. Once at the table we ordered some wine and main courses, friends ordered a fish I ordered steak medium rare. Drinks arrived fast and the waitress was very good, however once the main courses arrived steak was cooked well done. I immediately said it to the waitress however her response was you asked it like this however I will change it, it took some time for my plate to be taken back to the kitchen. While I was waiting for my steak to be redone my mates were enjoying their cod which they mentioned was very good, while they were eating a team of waiters began breaking down one of the communal tables, while this was happening one of the tables fell to the floor making a load noise and getting all of the restaurant to turn around. This was not an appropriate time to be breaking down tables while the restaurant was still half full. There was no presence of management at all. Once my food was ready I could see it on the counter, with severel people touching it with their fingers to see if it's cooked properly. (the only person touching it should be the chef). Once the food arrived waitress was very sympathetic and apologised for the mistake. However no manager checked if it was okay. Once my food arrived my mates were already finished their meal and we're in a rush to go. Also the side of fries that was ordered with the original meal was not changed and was left on the table so once my replacement meal arrived they were already stone cold.

My boyfriend asked for rare and got it blue, I asked for medium rare and it came rare ... even though it came different to how We asked, we still ate it as it was a fantastic steak. The service is appalling! A few of the staff members weren't the friendliest, and seemed to try and get you out as quick as possible. One of the waitresses kept coming over to our table asking if we were finished - she could clearly see we were still eating and done that for both the starter and main.  If you did want to visit here, I'd recommend visiting for drinks at the bar to admire the views. I wouldn't recommend the restaurant. It is highly overpriced and the food isn't fantastic.", "date_of_review": "14 April 2018"}

So often even at a great restaurant there will be the odd dud course but this one was perfect in every respect. By the standards of some of London's Michelin starred restaurants this is right up there and considerably better value too. The service and wines were all up to the same standard to make up a great experience with only one little complaint to stop this being perfect. Our complaint (which might be an attraction to some) is that the restaurant is a floor below the bar at the Novotel which is really quite noisy. As such do not go here if you want to enjoy a superb meal in a quiet environment. Finally, the view. Just stunning.", "date_of_review": "22 March 2018"}

Unfortunately we had a really bad experience from beginning at Bokan Bar . We came to the bar as we heard is a really good one . 1) The location is too out of reach , it means that I have to take in consideration to locate the venue . The transport is not a problem . Anyway this was not the main one reason .  2) The main reason why I do this review is when we got to the mini reception Bokan bar upstairs, we needed to greet the staff not her to greet us . She finished with the ex client taking care of their coats, etc, then we asked for a table, she was in rush saying i wlll find one for you next to the window. She went to find something, we were following her as we didnt know what to do, wait at reception or what / she stops at one table and start chit chat with that clients or friends . She forgot about us or what? we dont meean to be rude, but finally we asked her, excuse me could we have a table please ? the second time. she got nervous and said oh sorry about it , let me find then she starts moving . Finally she gave us a table opposite the bar , no view. Then she ignores us again.  Thats reception girl.  3) we ordered finally our drinks and we were happy we got the table.... till we got water x 3 times and the drinks didn't arrive. We asked for the drinks but we felt completely IGNORED We were waiting more than 25 Minutes there .  4 ) Finally we decided to leave the place... no drinks, no customer service, nothing. Most of luxury bars they serve nuts or small snack as beginning free or as from the menu and have been asked by waitress. What is missing ? The Bokan Bar is a very highly recognized Bar in London. You guys are competing with the bars and hotels around you The Pearson Room , Cinnamon restaurant Hilton, Scoff and Banter in Edwardian, etc but I have never had this kind of experience nowhere in such as 4 stars bar and Hotel . I have stayed in Dubai in Novotel, in Bahrain, and other places but never had this experience in my life. We travel a lot and stay in 5 stars hotels.  I would really want to come back but the customer service destroyed our evening.  And not the last one , we needed to spent time to get a taxi to re arrange our night out in the same time, time , energy, not good night out , money the last ... we lost .  I believe to get good customer service you need to have good waitress and waiters who works in team and for the same goal to achieve the highly customer service and make each customer happy in order a business to be run properly. if you want keep your clients and business of course . That is a priority.  very dissapointing", "date_of_review": "27 February 2018"}

Someone finally came to clear the table after the empty plates on the table for quite long time..We decided to leave and we have to walk to the bar to ask for the bill.

Despite us being locals. She thought we was wanting to book a table, despite us repeatedly saying \"we are here for our 2pm booking\". Then we was seated in the bar area at a table that was practically on the floor. I asked to be moved to a table where we wouldnt have to eat with our food on our laps. He then gave us a bar menu. We asked if we could have the brunch menu which we booked for. He said this was downstairs but the brunch was now over. I advised I had checked online and that I was sure the last SEATING for brunch was 2pm and it started at 12. However it get very confusing as he couldn't really understand what we was saying either. We were just about to leave when we checked to say are you sure we cannot have a table and he said that we could but we had to order as the kitchen takes the last orders for brunch at 2:30pm.

Enjoy this! It certainly is not the place for a romantic dinner. As far as we could figure, the highest floor comprises a bar with bookable table seating, with a limited bar menu, and VERY loud music. No conversation possible. On the floor below, down a short staircase, is the main restaurant, where we were booked. The 'music' noise from above resounds, but the volume is thankfully lower. Although is was Friday, and a couple of weeks before Christmas, this lower area was sparsely populated. This was a surprise. The menu, in our opinion, is very limited and fairly boring. The service is not too bad, but rather mechanical: eg. you are asked if you are 'enjoying' at critical points. The food is nicely and artistically presented on the plates, but too our surprise is not vey tasty. 'BLAND\" is the word that came to mind. My first course was 'Octpus and Beetroot\" and it was hard to get the taste of either of these components. Seemed like it had been boiled for hours. Second course was lamb which was equally 'non-lamby' in taste. The wine list was all highly priced, and from unknown vineyards. We had a Spanish wine from an area with which we are familiar. The wine was good, in that it had no bad qualities, but not much going for it either. BUT THE VIEW FROM THE RESTAURANT IS FANTASTIC. A meal for two with wine set us back \u00a3175. I rationalise this as good value, being \u00a3125 for the view and \u00a350 for the rest.", "date_of_review": "16 December 2017"}

The restaurant was full until 9pm, and so we had to settle for the bar. The place was very dark, and finding the table was not the say (for me, anyway). The awful din emitted by a woman squealing into a microphone (they tell me that it is singing; but it has nothing in common with Covent Garden) was so loud because, apparently, it has to carry over three floors in the building. The occasional breaks which she and her organ grinders took were the best bit - I could hear what was being said to me. I was not impressed by the requirement to hand over my bank card before an order could be taken. What might have been done with it while it was out of my sight was a concern, although it seems to have been all right. Clearly, this Novotel has had more than its share of dodgy customers, although how they could escape easily from the 38th floor was a mystery to me. I was assured that the food in the restaurant is better than what is available in the bar. This view was shared by our waiter. In my view, the meal was significantly overpriced The views across London were certainly breathtaking but, apart from the wonderful company I was in, these were the best part of the evening. If I could get into the restaurant itself on a quiet night (i.e. no squealing) I might try it again, but otherwise, for me, it lies between the very disappointing and a ripoff", "date_of_review": "22 November 2017"}

One criticism, I understand that a large percentage of staff in the service industry are from overseas but a grasp of the English language would be a help. My partner always worries if the staff do not understand gluten free and it did take a while to communicate this, sorry but \"I am French \" is not the answer we were seeking.

Most notable was the black pudding accompaniment and purees. Excellent meal.  The one area they can improve is staff knowledge of the wine list.

The service leaves a lot to be desired. We visited on a Friday afternoon, the venue was not overly busy, maybe around 30 customers. After taking a seat, we waited for someone to take our order and kept waiting. Eventually we gave up and attempted ordering at the bar, but we were completely ignored by the staff. After returning to the table we were finally able to place an order, 40 minutes after arriving. There seemed to be one bar man with responsibility for making drinks, meaning we waited a further 20 minutes on our drinks coming. We decided to order another round, and this time we're helped by a very friendly and helpful member of staff who was happy to answer our questions regarding the drinks list. The list looks great and you are really spoiled for choice. A separate member of staff then came back to us informing that two out of the three ingredients from our Negronis were not available. Bokan is not short of staff, with around 8 staff on the floor at the time of our visit. However they were not not overly interested in serving us with a couple leant over the bar on their phones for the duration of our visit.

Bokan is spread over three floors (37th, 38th and 39th). The 37th is the formal restaurant, the 38th is the bar (serving bar food) and the 39th is a secondary bar area with an outdoor deck (see photos). The lighting throughout Bokan is very low, which on the whole works well but definitely makes reading the menu difficult!  We decided to eat in the bar area on 38 and then have a drink in the bar on 39. The service on the 38th floor was fine but not great, the service on the 39th floor was much better. The bar menu is somewhat limited with approximately 5 or 6 'main' options. I ordered the burger, which was good and which came with some fries. It's the location of Bokan that really makes this place. The views across Canary Wharf and back towards the O2 are great. The only real negative was that on the evening that I was there, 2 out of the 4 elevators weren't working, which caused a bit of a queue when I was trying to leave.

Their booking policy for the terrace appears to be simply untruthful and misleading. It's understandable that during good weather it will be busy. What is unacceptable is when you ask them to book they say that the system is blocked. Even if you say that you will call later they say that you cannot book and that you will have to walk in early. You walk in early and surprise surprise, everything is already booked for the day! So basically they will not tell you that they are fully booked and you're lured in by the hope that there will be availability.

I even stood at the bar wanting a glass of wine, was standing right in front of the bartender who was YES I KNOW very busy, but he could have at least acknowledge my presence......It took for ever to get a glass of wine, and than had to ask for my check......Having said that the staff for the brunch if wonderful and if this obvious they are there to serve you and make sure your visit is as enjoyable as possible. Another comment, is that there doesn't seem to be enough tables on the 3 floors to accommodate the number of guests staying at the hotel. Also, there was NO information in the room for phone numbers such as room service, front desk, wakeup call, etc....and no visitor guide or magazine.

This place is split on 2 floors of which both have an internal part, with just the top floor having also a roof terrace. It's at the 48th floor.  The majority of the internal design is made of wood and pastel fabric, with big cushions, chairs, and a stunning view! Literally you can see all of London!! I have the feeling of being in a winter cottage in the Alps, but with the view of being in a modern side of New York! I absolutely love it.  The restrooms are also very nice and clean, and while washing your hands you still have the opportunity of looking outside and admire the view- yes from the restroom! A Big, enormous glass will give you this! The only downside that I've found every time I visited this place and spent money from the Bar, that I'm starting to be seriously annoyed by it - is that when you sit down even before you ask for drinks, they say \"you can be here just for 1 hour\" even when there is no message on the table saying \"reserved!\".  The best part is that after one hour NO one comes to tell you \"hey you need to move!\". Honestly they just need to try and tell me that - they would have no idea of how I would react.  I find pretty frustrating that in a rich and expensive place like this, they could have the authority to make me move because someone else needs to sit! If the manager reads this - I have enough money to stay there for hours and hours to drink and eat and I would like to be treated with the respect I deserve as a paying customer!!

However, on our last night I asked reception if it was ok to take my son up to the bar to see the London skyline, as it's spectacular. No problem he said. We went up to the 38th floor to be met by a young woman behind the desk who said if reception said it was fine to let a 12 year old in then it was fine. Juan behind the bar had other ideas. He said he weren't welcome and despite the place being empty, it was a condition of their licensing laws. First time I've been refused two glasses of Sprite in a hotel bar!  So, back down to the reception where the chap who said it was fine apologised profusely. Apparently if my son had been 13 rather than 12 it would have been fine. I lodged a complaint as I've never been humiliated like it by a hotel bar in my life. Another more sympathetic member staff agreed that it was outrageous.  On the Friday night I was in it there does seem to be a thread common in other reviews. Staff are unnecessarily rude and customers (including hotel guests,) are treated like we are lucky to be there.

However, the trip to the dockyard location is entirely worth while as the thoughtfully rustic decoration and slick service make for a stylish dining experience.         What we Ate:        The food menu has been created by Aurelie Altemaire, the former Head Chef at L\u2019Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon and the cocktails have been created by Danilo Tersigni, former GM at Mr Fogg\u2019s.       The seared scallops with a citrus tang served on a bed of organic pearl barley warm salad, limoncello and wakame.             Premium Aberdeen Angus beef tartar served with crunchy sesame crisp and wasabi mayo for that extra kick.       The beautifully presented Whole lobster is served with green mango salad, orange & jasmine sauce.       Thoughts:       Along with the excellent views, the food in Bokan lives up to the setting. This is the perfect unique surrounding for celebrations and gathering.

The views from the Bar are really superb, having seen the views at 4.30pm, decided to stay all evening just to experience the night time views. We were certainly not disappointed, they are really really superb. As the bar has floor to ceiling windows, you get a spectacular view of central London. Luke who served us in the evening was also very nice and very friendly, he even made a bespoke cocktail for my friend. Jeevan who is the manager there came and checked on us often. To be fair we were there from 4.30pm - 1am, but even still it was very nice to be checked upon and so looked after by Jeevan. He also gave us a show around of the restaurant and the roof top bar. We will definitely return. The only small feedback would have is to change the olives in the bar, they really did not taste good, they were almost bitter. We had a great evening at Bokan and would definitely recommend to anyone to go there for a drink..friendly staff and amazing views guaranteed!!

Menu however looked promising; short, simple but full of interesting combinations. Service was attentive from the beginning, but there was some clumsiness as well: waiter splashed good amount of wine on the table while pouring to my glass. First they served a beautiful amuse-bouche: some kind of tomato foam with a polenta (?) chip. My main course seared Sea Bass with green olive pur\u00e9e, artichokes, clams and olive oil was absolutely delicious, brilliant combination of flavours, I totally fell in love with the olive pur\u00e9e! For dessert I chose tropical meringue with coconut, mango sorbet and candied cashew: fresh, fruity and light in the mouth, mango gave lovely kick to the meringue and coconut. Jackpot!

We were always going out after but really wanted to visit this place as it has of course recently opened and looked amazing.  When we arrived we were a little early so fully understandable that the table wasn\u2019t ready but saying that, I called a good 30 mins before we was going to arrive and whoever answered the phone said the table was already ready. We stood there awkwardly in everyone\u2019s way by the entrance for a good 10 minutes waiting for someone to simply wipe down the table and clear the glasses so we could take a seat. As we finally got taken over to the table 3 of the 5 of us take a seat and 2 of us left standing as there was only 3 chairs when the booking was for 5!  As your waiter frantically panicked looking for 2 chairs, lucky another table offered us their 2 stools as your waiter came back saying he couldn\u2019t find any. By now you can imagine I wanted to just get up and leave due to the shambles going on around me. Couldn\u2019t get a table with enough chairs, could just about get my table and everyone seemed a little too busy to listen to what I was saying or to help. Seemed a little under staffed to me. Finally we are at the table and 15 minutes later we get given the menu so we can order a drink. After waiting another 20 mins for her to come back and take our order, we sat there patiently and waited for our drinks. By now I wondered if they were ever going to turn up but eventually they did. I didn\u2019t think it took that long to make a drink, we didn\u2019t even order food! Again, must have been understaffed as it wasn\u2019t particularly busy but all we have done so far is wait. Extremely inattentive. The drinks finally arrive! I have ordered my favourite cocktail (that isn\u2019t even on the menu) a Pornstar Martini. At first glance is looked amazing and by now I was so thirsty I was ready to drink it in 1! I sat there and thought, this is going to be so good and make up for the experience we have had so far, but\u2026. It was rancid. I don\u2019t know if your bar staff have ever had a pornstar martini anywhere else but I have never had such a sour tasting, dry, small pornstar martini in my life. Even the prosecco on the side was again, extremely dry and sour to the taste. I would never order a Pornstar Martini from here ever again, even worse that one I have had from the likes of Be At One or All Bar One and this is supposed to be an amazing rooftop bar competing with the likes of Radio Rooftop and Rumpus Rooms and it was just not even comparable. Id compare it from my experience so far to my local Weather Spoons. Right, ive had enough, we are leaving, attic bar is around the corner and ive been there before and know it is a safe bet. This is me trying to salvage what dignity I have left as I have recommended this to everyone and booked it for a friends Birthday and it was just a shambles. Trying my best to keep spirits high as everyone looks like they have just had enough and want to go home. I manage to finally get hold of someone to get my bill as no one is giving eye contact so unless you chase after them, you are out of luck. I hand over this little business card that you get free at the front with a little number on it to get my card back (cant even supply the plastic tabs) and 10 minutes later get my card, and guess what? The completely wrong receipt. You literally managed to give me my card back with someone\u2019s else\u2019s receipt order. You can imagine how this looks, you could have given my card to the right person or if I hadn\u2019t have checked it, I would have paid nearly a \u00a3300 bill for my 5 drink order. I flag this up immediately to get my correct receipt. With this one I ask politely to take the service charge off my receipt as I refuse to pay 12.5% for what was terrible service. Your waiter comes back with yet another receipt. This time it is our order but there appears to be an extra bottle of Rose wine on there! Again not what I ordered. Like how bloody hard isit to print a receipt out of what we ordered on our tab with our table number? Obviously very difficult. This isn\u2019t the end though, here comes the embarrassing bit your end. When she (the original guy was obviously too embarrassed to come over) comes over to take the payment she asks \u2018Why do you not want to pay the service\u2019, I hate to say it as I am not a rude person, but I laughed in her face, I said you cant prepare a table with 5 chairs, cant put correct orders onto a receipt and im surprised I even got my bank card back. And you want me to pay you for this? She stood there stunned and said \u2018the company make us ask\u2019.  If this is true then you should be ashamed of yourselves. You charge good money for drinks alone but then expecting me to pay the extra 12.5% for the worst service I have ever received. I have received better service ordering a Bic Mac at 4am. It is up to the people paying if they want to pay service charge, hence why it is optional. To make your staff ask as to why is horrendous, everyone was looking at them and to think that is going to put me on the spot like it would most people, you are very wrong. I raised my voice and explained exactly why as your other customers listened in, in shock. I don\u2019t know if this was just a bad experience I had or if this is just what to expect from this place. Big name, great advertising, well set up with amazing views and good money spent on the interior! But as to the service, staff and drinks, unless I see a lot of good reviews go in soon, I don\u2019t think I will be going back or recommending this to any one I know. This just really lowered the mood and pretty much ruined our night when it was supposed to be the highlight! I hope your service will improve so no one else experiences what I did on Friday night.", "date_of_review": "19 June 2017"}

Although the menu online has the wrong pricing! A lot of the dishes went up by a few \u00a3s - would've expected prices to be accurate online! We ordered the scallops for starters, lamb and sea bass for mains with veg and chips for sides, and cheesecake for dessert. Starter was small, but delicious and both mains tasted good and were also pretty filling. Cheesecake was a bit different from your normal cheesecake - it was ok, but I wasn't a huge fan. We went up for late night drinks in the terrace lounge and the cocktails were reasonably priced. Shame it was quite windy and cold, as the views from up there are stunning.", "date_of_review": "10 June 2017"}

The hostess welcoming us was quite abrupt (on 38, not ground floor), and for the duration of our lunch didn't spare a smile. Our waitress was lovely and smiling, but didn't follow through the lunch: ie after our food was brought (by other people), she reappeared when we were finished to ask if everything was ok. My husband explained that although the food was excellent, no as I had to go to the bar to ask for cutlery, salt&pepper, and sauce, that half of my club sandwich was cold, and the burgers were just warm. So she proceeded in telling us that if we wanted a dessert , that would be on the house However, we never saw the menu.  We had asked a second round of drinks to the young lady who served us the food, and not being a waitress, she went to the bar to ask someone to come to the table to take the order...it never happened! I had to go to the bar to check on the order to be told that they didn't have it, to go back to the table that someone would be there shortly.....We had the second round after finishing the food. Long...too long. However, when we asked for the bill, it comes very quickly with the card machine. What can I say, the view is breath taking and the concept is great, but most of the staff there should have a thorough reminder of what pro-activity and customer service are.", "date_of_review": "5 June 2017"}

A cloudy day, and what could have dampened the view , soon changed to sun streaming through the cloud to highlight The Shaard and Millenium Wheel, sites we were able to see from our seats at the window table. Although the table had a 2 hour rebooking slot, something made clear in the booking, we were not made to feel as though we had to rush off or that someone was waiting for the table. As for the food. Well this has to be some of the best I have tasted in a while. From the 'amuse-Boucher ' to the main course of fillet steak, all tasted amazing. Will definitely be going back. Will have to just make up a special occasion to justify the visit. The icing on the proverbial cake has to be the roof terrace. The views from here, once evening had taken hold, were amazing.

We ordered a cheese platter to start, and waited almost an hour and half for this to arrive. We were however given a plate of calamari by way of apology, but we noticed that the only reason for this, was because they had ordered it by mistake, and didn't know what to do with it. The cheese board eventually arrived and was very uninspiring - not worth \u00a320! We decided to go and eat elsewhere as the whole experience was a bit of a joke.

For the restaurant: you do need to make a reservation in advance, and if you want a window table, do mention it while booking. The menu selection is amazing, I did try almost all of it. In my opinion the best from the starters are Sea Bass Carpaccio and the Squid, for the main is definitely an Angus Steak and the best dessert you must try is a Tropical Floating Island! The service so attentive, that we were recognized from the second visit.  For the bar: they have one of the best selections of cocktails. And a very good Lithuanian mixologist, that I would highly recommend getting cocktails from (don't remember what was his name). All cocktails come with a nice unusual decorations and the prices are very pleasant as well. I would definitely recommend to try a Hendricks Tea Pot! The terrace is very cozy, has loads of cushions and blankets and you can even order cigars.  Overall, it's the best sky bar I have visited in my life and there is a special place in my heart for it. Still looking up their career page, waiting for a marketing position to come up, as I would love to show the world how beautiful this place is!

Bokan is three floors at the top of the new Novotel. All have an exceptional view, though some of the taller towers in Canary Wharf restrict views to the North. Views to the West are essentially unobstructed. We dined on the middle level which is a bar with a restricted food menu. The lower level is the restaurant with a full menu, and the upper level is a bar with bar snacks only, though it is part open to the sky. I must say I wasn't expecting much given how good the views are, but both the drinks and the food exceeded our expectations. The cocktail list runs to two full pages, and although the drinks are themed around the Docklands' mercantile past, that doesn't impact on how they work as grown-up cocktails. The few we had were well mixed and well-balanced. The food, although simple, was well executed and flavourful. Meat was cooked as requested. Service, if I'm honest was a little intermittent, but I would put that down to how busy the place was on a Saturday night. Reservations are taken separately for each floor, and I would recommend them given how crowded it gets.", "date_of_review": "3 April 2017"}

It has a number of good reviews but i cannot see why at all. On arrival at the Novotel reception we were greeted by 5 members of staff all carrying IPads wow you may say? they directed us to the bar, but i could not see the reason for their presence as they didn't speak to us we spoke to them, very odd. On exiting the lift to the restaurant area we were met again by a very pretty young female maitre d, thats were that ends, she was confused and couldn't understand why we were there? We left the foyer and approached the bar were by we noticed behind the bar, 2 males picking leaves for garnish, 1 female waitress drinking a glass of wine and another constantly walking around making no eye contact or serving customers, strange we thought in a bar? how do they make money you may well ask. After waiting almost 10 minutes and not being acknowledged, we left and returned to the foyer area. I approached one of the same five greeters as we entered, and informed her of the extraordinary poor service we received, she apologized turned and carried on talking to the remaining 4 staff, i would love to meet the fool who employed this bunch!!.  As an employer myself, i was horrified to witness such poor customer skills and attitude to customers needs such as food and beverage, thats sarcasm!!, its obvious its not their money at stake, whilst the restaurant has good reviews this is our second time to this cheap rate hotel, this has certainly been reflected in our 2 visits, would i venture there again, no! i live here in Canary Wharf but would not recommend this restaurant or bar. Whilst tourists may stray unwittingly in, locals beware, its not good, for those who think its good value try Roka, Carluccio's, The Parlour, Plateau or The Manhattan Grill to name just 5 for those of you wishing something big and brash try Big Easy those of you who crave a view, try Nelsons column", "date_of_review": "4 May 2017"}

Beautiful dish perfectly balanced and seasoned, just the thing for an enthusiastic carnivore. My wife had a haddock ravioli with a unctuous runny egg yolk.  One of the stand out dishes we tried was a filet of roast red mullet with fennel and pissaladi\u00e8re. I am not a big fan of fennel but this dish has converted me. It is a really well put together dish perfectly executed.  The lamb cutlets with chimichurri and charred aubergines were great and a generous portion.

Initially the doorman to the hotel at the entrance tried to turn my boyfriend away despite the fact he was wearing a shirt and trousers, he was also wearing white converse and therefore 'trainers'. As we were not informed there was a dress code upon booking a table, I have suspicions this could have been because another reason such as his race and nothing to do with what he was wearing. I did look on the website post our visit under their policy section to describe the dress code as ..... 'Smart casual. No athletic sportswear and shoes, no flip flops, no beach wear. Denim is acceptable. The team reserves the right to deny entrance should a guest\u2019s attire and overall presentation not adhere to our dress code.'  After making it up to the floor of the restaurant we were then told that as we were now 10 minutes late and therefore could no longer seat us at a table. Instead we were told we could have a seat at the bar if we wished. However, as the restaurant was not even half full this seemed unreasonable why staff flat out refused to seat us at a table for lunch. Needless to say we swiftly left and instead dined at The Big Easy, a few minutes away on the DLR.  I suggest that the policy on dress code as well as the cut off for on a booking is explicitly made clear when booking a table so others do not also waste their time.

We had booked the restaurant on the 37th floor for 6pm followed by a booking in the rooftop lounge on the 39th floor at 8.30pm. We were meeting up with some friends who we hadn't seen in a while. The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially the server at our table (sorry but I didn't manage to get his name). We started with one of their shared platters which was a nice mixture of charcuterie and cheese and a lovely runny scotch egg. Steak and lamb from the Josper grill was cooked just right. The wine list was interesting and, for London, reasonably priced. The view overlooking the river and towards central London was very nice - definitely one of the highlights. Based on the service, the views and the food I would have given Bokan a 4 or maybe even a 5-star rating, but unfortunately the extremely loud music ruined the evening for us.  When we arrived there was a live singer playing in the rooftop lounge on the 39th floor - playing very loudly. Luckily we were booked in the restaurant on the 37th floor - you could still hear the singer who was on the 39th floor (two floors above us!) but the overall volume wasn't too loud to impede conversation and so we had a nice time. The singer finished soon after 8pm just as we finished our meal and we moved to the 39th floor for coffee and after-dinner drinks with a nice view over Canary Wharf. When we arrived the music was loud but not completely overbearing. But as our coffee and drinks arrived the music was turned up to a volume where conversation was impossible. We asked if it could be turned down a bit, but were told that it couldn't be. So we quickly finished our drinks, paid up and left. A disappointing and noisy end to what otherwise was a nice evening.", "date_of_review": "25 March 2017"}

We arrived happy. Full of joy. It was Friday, St Patrick's day. Spring is not far away and all was right in the world. Now the concept is great and the decor in keeping with the name and the appeal of this bar and restaurant. And as for the view - fantastic! Wonderful! Terrific! The welcome was warm and inviting and we were given a table by the window and all seemed well. How we laughed and joked and smiled.  But then it all came crashing down faster than Lehman Brothers in 2008. And it came down to the crucial element of any hospitality establishment - service and quality of the product.  And I am afraid both were as terrible as each other.  We were seated at just after 6pm. Drinks menu presented to us just over five minutes later. A bit slow but no problem as admiring the view and taking it all in. Still happy. Still smiling. Our order was taken 15 minutes later. Now that is slow. Not even in a pre cursory check after five minutes to see if we were ready. But still smiling. Great company, great view and it's a Friday - what's the rush?! So now it is around 6.20pm.  Our drinks arrived just after 7. Not so happy.  We were asked by three different people if we had ordered in that time and the original waitress came over at around 6.45 to say our drinks were on our way. That was just a lie really. If you are going to lie to me at least do it in a way that makes it believable at least. And preferably not when I am starting to dehydrate. (Yes not even a water was offered at this time - I am 38 floors up - I can't go find water for myself. I am not Bear Grylls!)  But at least we have a drink! Sound the trumpets! Now let's hope they are worth the wait.  They were not. Sigh.  As for the cocktails themselves they were below average and not worth the money. It appears the alcohol may have been mixed with a Thames Water special but who am I to say? However they may have been tainted by the terrible service we had received.  But fortunately we were compensated - by a small bowl of crisps. No offer of anything else and quite insulting really that it was deemed a bowl of crisps which cost no more then 10-15p at wholesale price was more than adequate as compensation for the 45 minute wait for two drinks. At least we wouldn't die of hunger.  Amazingly we didn't fancy losing another hour of our lives waiting for another 'just serve it up and give it to them drink' so decided to leave.  Then, as for the cherry on this proverbial soggy bottomed cake (Mary would not be happy!), we had to go to the bar ourselves to pay the bill and, as our card was behind there to open the tab, it was automatically charged without us having a view of the bill let alone the chance to dispute anything on their including the 12.5% service charge! Thank the lord for that bowl of crisps!  So in conclusion if you want to lose water weight before a bodybuilding competition come here. Otherwise you are better off in other sky bars across London. And don't give them your card!", "date_of_review": "22 March 2017"}

There was a warm welcome on arrival and we were taken to a high table in the bar. I asked the person who showed us to the table if the food came from the same kitchen in the bar and the restaurant but she said it was a better menu in the restaurant, which I expected. Then she said that they had had a cancellation in the restaurant so could move us to there, which we were very happy about. Our table was right next to the window and the view was fabulous. The decor inside the restaurant and bar is very industrial, with big windows really making the best of the view. The only issue we had was the music. It was kind of annoying and it would have been nice to have something a bit more mellow to enhance the sophisticated atmosphere. We selected a very nice bottle of portuguese red and looked at the menu. Some excellent bread was brought to the table. The menu wasn't huge but we both found things we wanted to try. For starter we shared the Bokan board which had a selection of charcuterie, cheese, pate and a scotch egg. The pate lacked a bit of flavour but the scotch egg was perfectly cooked with a runny centre. For main we had the pork belly and venison pie, both were very tasty. The desserts were also very good and beautifully presented, plus good coffee to finish. The service throughout was charming, friendly and helpful. Overall we had a lovely evening.

I made a reservation well in advance with request for a window table. Instead of that on arrival I was told that we have table allocated at the bar !! After 10-15 minutes of pretended rush by the stuff they found a table not any near the windows.  probably worth mentioning that there were at least 3 tables available by the windows at the time we enter and left !!  We ordered drinks at the bar as we had to wait the team to sort the mistake with the reservation and we got the order wrong twice. Not to mention that one person joined minutes later and no one even bother came around to get te drink order. The restaurant food was just OK for the price you pay. However it was not explicit that all mains come without any sides and we were not promoted by the waiter to order side. It took 45 minutes for the mains to arrive and only then we realise that they don't come with sides hence we needs up eating without any.  Also it was greatly disappointing to see that they added 12.5% service charge which is not discretionary as I have noticed they claim to be in other reviews. For the service I received I would not have bothered paying any tip but they have made sure thy get what they want by the mandatory service charge.  Also they have to think about te dress code for this place if they don't want to turn it to Local Nando's - quite a few people were dressed not so appropriately for this type of establishment - to put it into perspective it is not very pleasant to see some customers with low hanging jeans and revealed bottoms . Overall it is worth no more than an overpriced observation deck. Perhaps the Hal price offer at the begging might have attracted the wrong crowd and established this venue as mediocre.

The food though... okay it's a soft opening and will take a little time to get it right. I maybe should have said something on the night but am not in the habit of doing so. We ordered a whole lobster each and asked for separate chips as a side dish. We were told the chips would come with the meal anyway so we desisted. What we got were two very nicely cooked BUT extremely small half lobsters with the smallest portions of chips ever. Now, Rick Stein would charge the same amount for a lobster, not half of a small lobster. It was so small or else would not dare saying anything. I think the menu should say half lobster rather than whole lobster if you intend to charge \u00a335 each. It was a soft opening so we paid half and can only think that is the reason why we got half?

Unfortunately the description of the version pie was misleading as it apparently came with winter vegetables, but these were nowhere to be seen. It's also much more of a cottage pie, than what I thought would be a nice piece of pie with a good crust. The chicken was also slightly dry and needed some kind of sauce. As sides we had chips, the smallest portion I've ever seen, salad which was fine and then cauliflower cheese \"crumble\". Not sure how it was a crumble and it was not nice so I would not recommend this.  We then had cocktails, with the amazing view, and these were very good. Although it's a bit cheeky that they add service to drinks for no apparent reason.

And maybe the bar too! (hic!)  This visit was made during the soft opening period so we were prepared for anything to happen.  We had some issues with the meal. My starter was ice cold but the plate had been warmed up. For a pea and mint fritter, that gave the game away that they weren't freshly prepared to order. No biggie, but surprised someone would plate up something straight from the fridge and hope that the customer wouldn't notice.  We also had some issues with a member of our party who asked what she could have that was gluten and dairy free and offered alternatives or alterations, one of which arrived with dairy fairly obviously (a chocolate souffle that had a big Bokan signature chocolate (dairy) disc on it as one example). There seemed to be some disconnect with what the front of house staff were telling the kitchen crew and what was coming out.  With the other dishes, a fish dish was verging on being undercooked. A rotisserie chicken a tad dry on the breast meat section (wonderful flavour otherwise) and pork belly dishes that were well received. Despite these items, we really enjoyed the food.  We passed our comments on to staff to inform not criticise as we knew this was the soft opening but we were very keen to go and see this place. The staff were very gracious in their understanding and more than generous in removing items from the bill without us asking for this.  I imagine by the time of the official opening all these things will be ironed out and the place will be jumping. The atmosphere was great, matching the view and decor of the venue. The staff are very enthusiastic and provide a fresh venue for locals and wharfers to go to escape the other, sometimes dull, choices available on the main CW estate. Several of my group are considering hiring out part of the venue for parties, so despite the small setbacks on the night we went, we know that this place will be pretty good when it gets into full swing.

The butternut squash soup was amazing, the beef tartar was okay.  As about mains, the burger is a burger. Nothing much to say. The chicken was however badly undercooked and quite plain.  The desserts were not even close to expectations. Yuzu tart was small and boring, barely tasted anything. The chockolate souffl\u00e9 was too much, contained too many eggs and looked raw. They explained to us it was the special crunchy chocolate balls in it. It was not crunchy for sure and resembled to egg yolk badly.  The service was okay, bit more practice and it will be perfect.  I would have a better opinion if I see more effort to fix the mistakes. Sometimes it helps if you ask what you can do to make it better than simply say sorry or tell the customer they are wrong.

It's on the 37th floor, accessed by an impressively swift lift to the 38th floor bar and reception area, itself just below the 39th floor roof terrace. Unsurprisingly it's biggest attraction is the view it commands over vast swathes of London and from my seat northwards as far as Hertfordshire. A pity then our view was impeded by the fact we were seated at what seemed to be the only table adjacent not to a window but a metal frame. In addition to the a la carte was a lunch menu featuring two courses for \u00a322 and three for \u00a326. This represented quite a bargain compared with the a la carte many of whose mains (without sides) cost as much if not more than three courses on the set menu. The 50% discount on food as part of the soft launch, however, gave us an excuse to go a la carte. There is no children's menu (indeed my daughter appeared to be the only child dining) but a main of spaghetti with tomatoes and pesto was served with our staters and, as requested, without olives. It was such a substantial dish it kept her occupied beyond the finish of our mains. My wife started with burrata which was suitably creamy although the accompanying crackers were not particularly crispy. My steak tartare was beautifully served on a plate with little spots of dressing but could have had more egg yolk whisked in than I noticed. My main, a poached fillet of cod on a bed of spinach with shrimps covered in a brown foam was a sensational dish, but at \u00a326 at full price perhaps needed to be. My wife's chunks of salmon on green beans looked a little more prosaic by comparison. A ginger pudding we shared for desert hit another high note, but the bitter stewed espressos were fairly horrible. My wife and I are admittedly fussy about coffee but never cease to be amazed by the sheer unpleasantness of espressos served in so many venues in London including those that specialise in coffee such as Caravan who really ought to know better. We enjoyed our glasses of house white until they were shown on the bill as Chablis at a fairly astonishing \u00a39 per glass as opposed to the \u00a35.40 for the eminently quaffable vin du maison. So all in all an accomplished meal not without the odd blip and, in common with the location of the restaurant within the hotel itself, not quite hitting the heights.", "date_of_review": "5 March 2017"}

A 25 minute wait for the coffees was the final straw, as a local business we were hoping for a fabulous restaurant nearby for lunches, not many companies allow for a 2 hour lunch break, the views are the only thing that impressed... really disappointed ", "date_of_review": "2 March 2017"}

We were not staying at the hotel, but went in for dinner a few days after the hotel opened, in the 'soft launch phase'. The food is really good, all four of us were impressed. The views are spectacular, both in the restaurant and in the bars on floors 38 and 39. Service over dinner was not as polished (the wrong starter was served twice and our wine order had to be repeated as it got lost first time), but the staff were unfailingly polite. Hopefully a few more weeks to allow the staff to become familiar with the operation and everything will smooth out. We will definitely go again.", "date_of_review": "24 February 2017"}

Thank you Juan! My drink was amazingly well made and I very much enjoyed the presentation and added twist of edible flowers made it special.. this really impressed my date and the staff were very knowledgeable about their drinks! The views are really epic and I'd suggest that anyone visiting canary wharf should make this an addition to their plans", "date_of_review": "9 March 2017"}

Our table was in a corner which gave us a incredible 180 view over London. The food by Chef Aurelie was amazing, super fresh and very creative. Don't miss the \"Mushrooms, Hen's Egg & Toast\" and the succulent \"Hereford 28 Day-Aged Ribeye Steak\". The service was not only prompt and faultless but very friendly too. Last but not least the decor is stunning, nothing like I've seen before. Prices are very affordable for the level of quality. Overall would highly recommend!", "date_of_review": "12 March 2017"}

The hotel is in its 'soft opening' time. If you do not like heights do not go here. The restaurants and bars are on floors 37/38/39 and many tables are beside the windows. I went on the day when Doris was blowing the the building was rocking gently in the gale.  The service was good and the staff attentive, but not over bearing. For those who have been in a Novotel before this was very different. The decor was wood and iron work everywhere. The food was a significant step up from any Novotel I have ever been to, including those in France. I am planning another visit. I imagine that the top floor outside bar will be spectacular on a less windy day, or at night.", "date_of_review": "24 February 2017"}

The cocktails very delicious and very creative, we then went down to the 37th floor for dinner where a table by the window was ready for us. Stunning views.  The menu is very diverse with inspiration from both French and British cuisine.  I highly recommend the tartar as a starter, it was delicious. The mains were all well plated up, cooked and seasoned.  Service was very prompt and cheerful.  Great value for money, top notch dinner with amazing views. We will definitely be back to try out the lunch menu", "date_of_review": "8 March 2017"}
