Our booking for 12pm saw us one of only two couples in the restaurant so it made a very quiet and relaxing atmosphere. Things \u2018picked up\u2019 a little throughout our meal as more diners joined other tables. Staff were exceptionally attentive and very polite.  We found the menu less brunch and more lunch with not many items that jumped out at us.  My friend ordered the crab, I the fried gnocchi and for for the table the whole chicken and bread. The gnocchi and crab arrived first and we were told the chicken would arrive separately - it would\u2019ve been helpful to have been told this on ordering as we suspect they are cooked to order as it did take some time to arrive. The portions are small and despite being asked you want the whole chicken\u2019 I\u2019m glad I did order it as the gnocchi would have left me hungry as delicious as it was. The whole chicken was \u00a331 and served only with a sauce and alioli; again as tasty as it was it wasn\u2019t quite worth \u00a331.

The restaurant is beautifully designed, and we enjoyed the cocktails we had at the bar - the bar service was also very good. However, if the restaurant is going to charge \u00a3170 for a meal for two they really need to up their game. The bread and starter (artichoke veloute) were both excellent. I also enjoyed the wine the friendly server suggested. However, the cod was awful. It came in a broth which just drowned any cod pieces and was completely tasteless. Combined with some stringy vegetable it was a hard dish to physically eat. I spent most of the time trying to chase the cod piece around the broth and very long stringy vegetable. However, after a couple of mouthfuls I decided it was not worth the calories and didn\u2019t eat any more. What\u2019s the point eating something so bland! My husband had the pork. It looked sous vide- so while it comes out looking a bit like the pork you would get in a school dinner he did report that it was very nice. We had the honey cake and the white chocolate mint thing to finish. Honey cake was good. White chocolate thing needed to be a bit creamier with more white chocolate, it was not that inspiring. I ate it but it had no finesse and I felt they really needed to raise their pudding game. Another disappointment was I had stated it was my husbands birthday when booking and again when we came into the restaurant. But no token happy birthday on the plate was done or anything similar. All in all, was it worth \u00a3170 and a trip out to Stratford - no. But hopefully things will improve", "date_of_review": "14 February 2020"}

The exquisite little choux bun stuffed with light parfait won't fill you, but the salt cod croquettes and roasted Jerusalem artichokes will. Everything was delish, and as the poverty priced Viognier (\u00a336) was delighting, we were on a rush of adoration. Sadly, whilst he loved his wild garlic porridge (as did I), my belly pork was way too chewy. They way the knife seemed to make little impact was not a good sign, and though it had suitably crispy skin, the rest was nowhere near as melting as it should have been. Puds were decent, though not overly memorable. Service was just great, from young staff who were without exception enthusiastic about the venture, and keep to help.

An icy chill in the air, plus bloated post-Christmas waistlines and credit card statements. The free venue finding team at Flavour Venue Search needed a little cheering up at this challenging time, so a visit to Allegra restaurant and bar generated all the happiness we\u2019d hoped for. Perched on the 7th floor of The Stratford, the newly built uber-cool hotel in, you guessed it \u2013 Stratford, Allegra\u2019s stunning food, service and ambiance blew away all our January blues. Allegra was brought to life by impressive ingredients. Patrick Powell, former head chef at Chiltern Firehouse and his team produce culinary works of art in the kitchen. The dining room was designed by Space Copenhagen, the team behind four-time World\u2019s best restaurant winner Noma. The result is truly delightful food, lovingly served in a space which marries modern Scandinavian style with tastefully understated luxury. The main dining room is furnished with rich wood and soft grey upholstery, with modern lighting warming the walls with a gentle glow. A smattering of metal and foliage completes this chic and comfortable space. There\u2019s also an indoor semi-private space for 12, an outdoor dining terrace and access to a breath-taking rooftop space with stunning London views. The food at Allegra was truly exceptional. Their seasonal menu showcases classic European skill blended with modern techniques and invention. The house bread included the best sourdough we\u2019ve ever tasted. Baked fresh twice daily and served with light salted butter and a tangy green sauce. We followed this with a delicious pre-starter of pistachio choux filled with a rich and creamy liver parfait, which was wonderful. Next, we tasted the crispy confit chicken wing accompanied by yummy parmesan dumplings, wild mushroom and sorrel. We thoroughly enjoyed the smoked eel pithivier. The cutest little pie with layers of smoke and creaminess, offset by a tangy chilli vinegar and a verdant thick sauce of parsley and garlic. Our dinner was made more joyous by the fantastic service we experienced. Our Sommelier was warm and demonstrated his expertise by picking out a tasty, low sulphite Lebanese red for our pleasure. Our waiter was approachable, charismatic and hilarious. The staff clearly enjoyed being part of something special. Speaking of special, our main courses were spectacular. The aged Gloucester old spot pork cut like butter and came with lovely barbecued carrots. The wild venison loin was among the best dishes we\u2019ve ever tasted. Cooked to absolute perfection and complimented with roasted celeriac, pickled blackberries and trompettes. This already stellar dish was elevated to new heights by the braised shoulder cottage pie accompaniment, which may be the best thing we\u2019ve ever tasted. The tart rhubarb and custard vacherin delivered a light sweetness to finish a magnificent meal. Allegra impressed us on every level. If we gave star-ratings, they\u2019d get them all. We\u2019ll certainly be recommending this wonderful establishment for private dining, corporate lunches, large group bookings and full venue hire events where quality is a must. If you\u2019re planning a special event, we\u2019ll tell you all about Allegra and the other excellent venues we can recommend.

Our visit was 3-days after the official opening and on a Saturday \"date night\". Upon arrival we were greeted by an excellent front of house team and were personally taken up 8 floors (in the lift) to our table situated in a long, comfortable room that encompasses the entire perimeter of the building. Dressed in muted tones all the decor is fresh and inviting. Service was excellent with lots of young, willing and eager staff and a learned sommelier who was keen to show-off the short, interesting wine selection and his well-stocked wine-room. There were a few blips along the way, most notably an error with the initial drinks order but the main issue we had was the main course. We ordered the \"sharing\" whole-roast-chicken and the perfectly cooked bird was brought to our table on a wooden board atop an array of pine branches - all very snazzy. The bird was then taken back into the kitchen for further preparation.  Salivating at the thought of such a sumptuous, plump bird being carved and laid-out on giant plates we were therefore very disappointed when it returned in its final form. Two small, over prepared slithers of breast meat and a dollop of mushroom puree was a major let-down. Half way through the main course a further plate of four small chicken \"snacks\" were brought out - what happened to the rest of the bird? Perhaps I'm a philistine and not aware of the intricate. skilled and detailed work that goes into reducing a succulent, plump chicken into what looks (and tastes) like over-salted turkey roll. For me (and my wife) it was a major anti-climax. Everything else was fine. Good wine, attentive service, nice cheeses and truly excellent Old-Fashioneds. We will go back but we won't have the chicken.", "date_of_review": "1 October 2019"}

Knowledgeable bar staff with fantastic cocktails (try the Up-Beet for something different and incredibly tasty). Top notch service and the food oh wow! Our favourites - pistachio choux (I would eat loads of them) the Crap tart was incredible tasty and the textures were exquisite. And the honey cake was elevated by the sommelier\u2019s recommendation of a glass of Greek Muscat. Restaurant is beautifully designed with a serene interior space that made the dinner even more special.  Service 10/10 Food 10/10 Drinks 10/10 We\u2019ll be happy to go again!", "date_of_review": "6 October 2019"}

The architecture of this hotel will be an iconic building for the future, close to all the amenities of the East Village which is the legacy of the 2012 Olympics. The interior design is by the same company who designed NOMA in Denmark; we are lucky enough to have been there and there are similarities but the Allegra; is slightly more sumptuous.  The style of cooking is European, small dishes, from the chef who made Chiltern Firehouse a success. Expensive but a joy to be there as the staff are charming and the atmosphere calm. The roof garden is beautiful and there is an area which in the summer will be wonderful but was quite empty on the evening we dined.  We went for all the starters on the menu, slightly mixed, some excellent some not quite sure. Bread is charged for but only three pounds. However one of my great bugbears is where in France does one ever pay for bread? The brasserie and bar on the ground floor of the hotel are also very nice but music far too loud and inappropriate for conversation and business get togethers. A lot of singing and just too loud. When asked to turn it down we were told this couldn't happen as it was pre-selected - really! This is really the first of what I am sure will now be a number of high end restaurants in this area as the East of London quite rightly becomes more and more popular.", "date_of_review": "6 October 2019"}

The smoked eel pithiver is an amazing instagram picture - with the beautiful green parsley garlic pur\u00e9e complementing the flaky pie with creamy smoked eel and potato confit inside, but it also had superb flavor, was freshly baked, and wasn\u2019t too heavy.  I also enjoyed Scottish lobster with crown prince pumpkin - served as discs, broth, and pur\u00e9e, with the claw meat on top of shiitake mushrooms. Artful presentation and especially tasty! Service was attentive and friendly and a fairly broad selection of wines by the glass - including some more exotic choices such as an assyrtiko from Santorini. Highly recommended if you are not only looking for atmosphere and design but also superb food, it is well worth venturing out to.", "date_of_review": "25 October 2019"}

Dining on the 7th floor with good views ,however bit to cool today to use what looks like a attractive garden terrace. Lunchtime menu was a bit of the limited side - mains - 2 cod dishes,1 chicken and 1 veggie dish ,no red meat ! What we had was first rate, on the small side but very tasty. Good recommendation for the wine and very good service . Gluten free no problem, lovely gf bread.", "date_of_review": "15 October 2019"}

Friendly, professional service - attentive but not uncomfortably. We were a party of four and chose different starters to share - faultless. Weirdly my son insisted we try the bread too - once you eat it, you'll see why. Beyond perfect sourdough and creamy, oh-so-salty butter and then another one (Irish soda?) that had a green sauce - tasted like a cut lawn on a summer's day. No idea what was in it but tasted fantastic. We all had mains of lamb which was again delicious. I don't usually have dessert when we are out as I often feel let down - not this evening! We ordered four different ones to share and they were sublime. The creamiest of ice creams - unique flavours - syrup pudding to die for, pastry, Apple combo that was truly the best I've eaten. Really blown away. We are hypercritical diners as we like to think we can cook to a good standard and couldn't fault the food or the service.  Our only negative thoughts with were the hyper-sensitive taps in the bathrooms - yup, that's our only negative!", "date_of_review": "3 November 2019"}

But fear not the destination in question is not downtown New York but the Stratford hotel adjacent to Stratford International station. By enlarge my lunch here lived up to the hype. Not sure about the view of Westfield Shopping Centre or other skyscrapers still under construction but the interior all light Danish furniture and furnishings with an outdoor terrace was comforting enough. The lunch menu is short. No more than half a dozen starters that rather morph into even fewer mains. Bread served in two varieties one brown the other sourdough with salted butter and a minty sauce made for a quite superb start. Service was attentive too with my water carafe being replaced as soon as it had been almost completely drained. A glass of white Zinfandel was refreshing. My starter and main were similar in that they both featured fish as their central ingredient and a spoon sufficed to consume the yellow sauce each cane in. For my starter a dish containing cubes of trout pieces of potato and herbs had poured over it from a jug what was described as a chowder but which was more of a consomm\u00e9. An egg yolk neatly dissolved into the mixture. My main of cod again cut into small pieces came with coco beans in a stew. Both were two of the most accomplished dishes I have had anywhere this year. A dessert of figs on an ice cream beneath a granita was a cool finish. No complaints about the espresso either.", "date_of_review": "18 September 2019"}
