We were on the roof terrace, all safely socially distanced in the open air yet covered by a very large type of parasol.It was ideal. There is an open fire so you can stay warm without noisy or obtrusive heaters.  The food was great and the service outstanding. The roof terrace is totally private from the rest of the pub and is ideal for wedding receptions, work parties , or just a private party.I n the covid era with all its guidelines, a safe yet surprisingly cosy ambience. All this with the most positive and helpful landlord you could hope for , and it didnt break the bank either.", "date_of_review": "17 August 2020"}

We have eaten here quite a few times, and when we knew we were coming to London again a few weeks ago we booked for Sunday 14th of July. We booked for Sunday lunch with a time of 5.30. We arrived at 5.00 and had a couple of drinks downstairs, then went up to the restaurant area at 5.30 to eat. We shared a white bait which was ok, but nowt special. We had then ordered the Sunday roasts, my wife the chicken, and me the beef.   It arrived and again was nowt special, but to my dismay was stone cold. The waiter asked how was our food, I told him it was stone cold, and he said he'd get another, but it would take 15 mins as they make it all fresh. So my wife was eating here with me sat there waiting for the chefs to make my fresh hot dinner. After a few minutes my wife also complained that gets wasn't hit either, so we asked tgecwaiter if it could be heated up a bit in the microwave, he said they couldn't do that as they don't have a microwave (I find that hard to believe )  After 20 minutes he brought our fresh meals again, and again mine was stone cold, the Yorkshire pud looked like it has been made hours before, and was rock hard, and just disintegrated when I tried to cut it as it was so dried out. My beef wasn't rare, it was actually raw flesh ! The veg was cold and over cooked, it was total garbage, and not fit to feed a dog.   I took the plate back to the chefs and told them in no uncertain terms that this was total garbage, the manager said there was nothing wrong with it, so I asked her to taste it which she refused.

OK no problem now I've read the menu and the waiter tells me the bavett is a big dish. I'll have eel and Pinot Gris, Bavette with Nero d'Avalo and sparkling water. Scene 2 the \u00a310 eel was 35mm x 20mm, teaspoon of rhubarb and teaspoon creme fraiche - OK I ordered as an experiment 'cos smoked eel isn't something I know. Portion size was a surprise at price but its E1. Now I know smoked eel is significantly similar to smoked mackerel and hey I'l just have a desert Scene 3 the bavette arrives. Another small portion. Yikes its tough to cut, tough to chew and stringy, not that tastie but the Bearnaise helps. C'est la vie. Try the pomme anna - nice and crisp, in places not 100% cooked through, try the baby gem - OH Yuck - Mustard dressing yuck yuck yuck how did I miss that? I didn't - its not on the menu despite being an allergen. Scene 4 Report back the bavette wasn't great, the mustard was horrid and unannounced... Scene 5 Waitress \"My college says you didn't like...\" \"No I say because.... \" There is something in her look I don't understand I pause \"You asked...its an allergen...its not listed...\" she replies \"I can't know everyone's tastes and its not my fault\" Oh i reply I thought... No I just came to apologies Oh OK thanks for the apology (why am I giving the thanks for whats progressively a declining experience and the attitude I could do without!?) then I go to finish the wine and luckily I spot the slagheap of sediment in the glass - emptied the very dregs of the bottle into the glass. There was an offer of a \"splash\" Really on top of all the above? It was removed from the final bill - good - but by then I've decided I won't chance a desert and I don't want to stay where I'm giving the thanks for a bad experience and the discussion and recognition still translates to we'll make our profit from you. IF they'd got it all correct I think it would have been good despite some reservations on portion size. IF they'd addressed the issues I could have said \"at least...\" and felt better about \"we all make mistakes...\" and I think the waiter was there even if the waitress clearly was not. As it is I'm disappointed, mildly hungry, Almost \u00a350 poorer and pissed-off. None of which is individually too bad but all together is a 2 star. I hope for you none of these factors repeat but I see I'm not the first to note most of my points", "date_of_review": "2 April 2019"}

This is apparently their style. it is something special but worth the effort! This also gave the necessary charm to the whole experience. Very nice that there is a Nespresso coffee machine in the room and delicious freshly made chocolate cookies that were replenished daily.

A caponata starter was light, tasty and came with good home-made ricotta. Another starter of asparagi was satisfying in the way basic dishes can be: just a high quality product matched by a well-made accompaniment, in this case a Hollandaise. Pork belly was full of flavour too and immensely satisfying, thanks to the quality of both the produce and the cooking, perfectly matched by a bean cassoulet. But the best dish of the evening was a cod, good, yes, but the show almost stolen by the amazing tomatoes coming with it, donating their sweet flavour and their intense moisture to the dish, with an olive tapenade providing yet another layer. The mains were the peak of our meal. This time we were underwhelmed by the desserts: a very eggy cherry clafoutis with very few cherries, lacking love; and a strawberry Eaton Mess consisisting mostly of lumps of sweet meringue, with little cream and virtually no strawbeeries. Service was pleasant, prices are OK for this area of London and in relation to the quality (and portions are not mean either). I tried a tequila cocktail and wasn't too impressed, but the drink list is interesting. The cuisine here is very direct and unfussy. Most dishes are very simple, but there is cleverness in this simplicity, and when you make the effort of getting high quality produce, this may be one of the best ways to showcase it.", "date_of_review": "15 June 2018"}

Even on a busy Sunday (and it does get busy and bustly), the staff were very welcoming, friendly and attentive. We had a selection of starters which were generally very good indeed; tasty and well presented. The main courses (although not 'Roasts' in the traditional sense) were excellent. The bavette steak and pork belly came on platters and were excellently cooked and full of flavour. The accompanying roast potatoes, Yorkshire puddings and cauliflower cheese were really good. A very small criticism being that it left an overall impression of being just a touch salty, although this may just be down to individual food selection and my low salt threshold.

Two minutes walk from Aldgate East tube with well appointed rooms on the second floor. Room was small (but this is London) but comfortable and very clean.

We were not disappointed with any aspect of our stay from the warm welcome with the first drink on the house to the exceptional full English breakfast the next day. Our room was decorated in the Culpeper style and very clean and well-appointed with a bijou en-suite well-stocked with toiletries. Whilst the pub is popular and busy, the noise from below does not travel up to the bedrooms which have double glazed windows anyway. Every member of staff was onside with the fact that the customer should be treated well. We have to single out Tamsin, who was looking after check-in and was also maitre-de in the restaurant.

The pub is located on Commercial Street about 2 minutes walk from Aldgate East station. Very nice decor, especially downstairs, in an industrial chic kind of of way.  Had a drink downstairs to start with and got served pretty quickly despite the crowds. Good range of drinks including locally brewed beers. I must admit I was sceptical of the Xmas dinner menu arrangement - as a group you had to vote for your favourite dishes and those that got the most votes would be served and shared, i.e. no individual servings. This meant that if you are a very fussy eater you could theoretically end up with nothing you like. I decided to go vegetarian as that actually guaranteed your own starter and main.  The starters were enjoyed by all, though the omnivores struggled with the vegetable tart as it was really too small to be cut up and shared amongst so many. It also created a colossal mess on the table. For the main course, the omnivores got a real feast of meats and side dishes; whereas the vegetarians got a tiny portion of angel hair past with pesto and a few slivers of jerusalem artichoke and no sides (if the vegetarians were meant to get a share of the other sides that was not explained). The vegetarian portions were so small we had to go and order some chips to have enough to eat. Seeing that the vegetarian meal cost the same as the non-vegetarian meal that struck us as pretty outrageous. The pasta also seemed like an odd choice for a Xmas meal even though the taste was good.  The beef was very rare, which was enjoyed by some, but those who prefer their meat more well done struggled to eat it. Dessert was shared by all and the huge quantities of crumble and cheese served definitely made up for lack of vegetarian main course. We all ended up incredibly full. Overall the concept of the meal didn't go down that well, but everyone really enjoyed the food itself. It's rare to get a good Xmas meal in a group but we all agreed that the quality of the food was excellent. Seating was a bit tight and made the sharing more difficult and messy. The service was extremely good and Fabio who served us was utterly brilliant.  I have every intention of returning to have some more of the food but will definitely go a la carte next time and probably opt for the meat rather than the vegetarian option.", "date_of_review": "2 December 2017"}

Two minutes walk from Aldgate East and 5 -10 minutes from Liverpool Street tube stations. Flesh pots of Shoreditch, Hoxton and E1 in general all within easy striking distance.

Rooms are very well appointed. Someone has gone to a lot of trouble to take the rooms back to a dilapidated, Victorian look but this is far from a shoddy building. Very good beds, spotless bathrooms and good quality coffee/ toiletries. Love the historical books on the area. Breakfast is taken in the restaurant and is very special. Full range of cereals, bread and pastries cooked on the premises and superb cooked options (try the Harissa Eggs). Left luggage facilities and a separate side entrance if the bar is closed. We ate a light lunch on the Roof Terrace. I know there are mixed reviews but the test is trying to get a table up there. The bar does stay open late but we found noise was not an issue.

A free cocktail (and a couple after) followed which were unique really and new to us (and we know cocktails!). We visited the roof garden which is quite small but charming and a little piece of bucolic greenery in the City. Bed was extremely comfy and the room surprisingly quiet considering it's on a main arterial road. Breakfast the next day was even better than lunch. A full English with french black pudding-that should be an affront to this Lancastrian but it was too good to fault. All in all a cracking stay.

Perhaps it's because unlike many of its rivals, it adapts at weekends to what appears to be an egg-based brunch formula. Scrambled eggs with slices of Bayonne ham was enjoyed by my wife, whilst my daughter had an exemplary croquet Monsieur. I had a more conventional cottage pie served in an earthenware bowl with a side dish of rather refreshing kale, a green I'm pleased to see is coming back into favour.

On first impression it seemed nice and was busy which always is a good sign. I ordered the roast lamb which was on the standard menu and my daughter ordered the gnocchi. Well all I can say it was the worst roast I had ever had!  The lamb was just a slab on my plate, a bit like a doorstep. The vegetables were covered in a burgundy colour so I couldn't actually make out what they were and the worst were the roast potatoes which seemed to be reheated and glazed in another layer of oil and re used again and again! I complained that they were rock hard and they brought the same out again, couldn't eat it. There was no fresh veg as you would normally get with a proper roast and no colour to the dish. The only good thing about it was the huge Yorkshire pud that came with it. Disappointing!", "date_of_review": "31 January 2017"}

We paid quite a lot of money for a rather mediocre meal. The apetizer was good but didn't require any cooking (burrata with a bit of pesto on top) and the main was a sad looking dish with beef mixed with chocolate and mashed potatoes on the side. Not only that... they only had three mains on teh menus (one meat based, one fish based and a third vegeterian )!! Which is totally fine, but how can you get them wrong if you only have three (polus the apetizers of course but 90% of them didn't require any actual cooking), so that got me wondering what types of chefs they've got in the kitchen... I think it's one of those places aiming at creating a fancy dinner experience (hence the beef with chocolate) but lacking in the ability to actually do so. The atmosphere is good but nothing special (just another hipster places with a meant-to-be-fancy rough decor). I would definitely recommend avoiding this place for dinner. It's a rip off. The pub downstairs looks nice though, and perhaps also the food isdecent (you can't really go wring with a burger), but I haven't checked the prices...  In conclusion just to be on the safe side and mainly to boicot these London restaurateurs who don't even try to provide a decent service and treat customers like a bunch of fool cashcows - AVOID THIS PLACE", "date_of_review": "17 December 2016"}

The beef comes perfectly cooked on a large platter along with excellent Yorkshire puddings and lots of lovely roast vegetables. We had roast potatoes on one visit and what I would describe as roasted dauphinoise potatoes on the other: both perfectly cooked. You can order the beef in 100g portions which means it's perfect for all...depending on how hungry you are. They vary the roasts that are the alternative so sometimes chicken and other times pork. Both great alternatives. The staff were excellent and very accomodating and the price fair.

I had wine but a couple had cocktails and they looked lovely. It's a very relaxed vibe and this is reflected in the attitudes of staff, which I found quite refreshing, although some may be frustrated by this. The menu downstairs had a lot more variety although if you eat here you loose the charm of the garden. Highly recommended!!!", "date_of_review": "25 September 2016"}

Good selection of ales, wines and spirits.  Staff very effective and with real personality. They know their products and provide great service.  The restaurants don't take bookings, and can be very popular but it's a nice wait in the bar.  The first floor restaurant has a small menu, but one where I was happy to choose every dish. All cooked to order and good quality. The rooftop is entered through a greenhouse with their own grown produce. There was no space to eat there when I visited but it sure smelled good and worth a walk up to see the terrace.

Chose the Roast Beef. The waitress was telling me that the smallest portion is 300g but missed to inform me that they charge \u00a311/100g beef!!! No price on menu. There might have been small print but who reads small prints on a menu for prices - roasts are not normally priced this way in pubs and you would expect them to be around \u00a315-20 in pubs. We actually got the bill before getting the food because we got there late and the rest of our party was finishing up. So I saw \u00a333 on the bill - went and complained and asked if I could get a smaller portion than 300g as I was shocked by the price in a pub like this. Its a simple pub after all. They did nothing about my request and served the food anyways 20 minutes later. I was also not asked how I liked my beef - and was served quite rare that I do not like. I did not send it back because by then I was starving. In addition I was asking the waitress when I was ordering what the side is and if it was Yorkshire pudding and I was telling her that I can not eat gluten. She said it was a kind of roast potato - I said that is fine. However, she still served up a Yorkshire pudding with my meal. The meal was blend on top of everything. I paid a high price for a less than average meal. On top of everything, after expressing that I was not happy the waitress kept staring at me with a sarcastic smile on her face the whole time I spent there. She also asked whether I liked the meal - I answered honestly that no I did not like it at all - she did absolutely nothing about it.

The staff were all friendly, helpful and professional. We had drinks and tapas on the rooftop terrace for lunch. The space isn't huge but it has been well thought out and is a very relaxing area. The pub is a great base for exploring Spitalfields Market, the various bars around Shoreditch and the vintage shops. Not to mention Colombia Road market.  We had dinner in the restaurant. Although only 3 choices for each with lemon sole and steak to share as extra dishes there was plenty of choice for everyone. The waiting staff were helpful and gave us great recommendations for the food and wine. All which were spot on. The food was beautifully cooked and we all enjoyed our meal not one gripe!  The bar downstairs although busy wasn't too loud for a Saturday night. Plus there were plenty of seats. Drinks were all very reasonably priced. Breakfast was included in the price of the room and was delicious, lovely ingredients and all very well cooked.

The location is excellent for easy access to whatever you choose to do/places to visit, and has easy access to the underground (Aldgate East)  This is a unique place to stay, not your standard chain hotel, the rooms are comfortable, looking as though a coat of paint wouldn\u2019t hurt in a shabby-sometimes-chic style.

This is a busy and vibrant property, and again having read some negative reviews about the cost of drinks and food, let\u2019s get it into perspective. First of all, this is London. Once you\u2019ve got that, the choice of drinks was good, the food in the bar was high quality and not like your average gastro/pub grub.  The food in the restaurant was at an entirely different level, delicious and memorable, and credit has to go to the Head Chef and his staff for high quality produce, a lot from the roof garden, and has a wonderful ambience, with excellent service throughout. You need to book to get a table. To give you an idea of costs, on our last evening there were four of us for a meal in the restaurant. We all had starters, mains, desserts. We had two bottles of wine, coffee and liqueurs and our bill equated to \u00a345 a head. That was good value for money anywhere.

For a Tuesday this place had a great vibe. It definitely filled up with the after work crowd, and when we returned on Friday and Saturday night, it was equally busy. That being said, the bar staff are very attentive so you will not struggle to get to the bar and get a drink. This place could hold its own in Melbourne, Australia.  The Culpeper is four levels. The ground floor is a pub vibe with lots of natural light from the full length windows. On this level they serve a good but short selection of food (some of which is on the menu upstairs in the restaurant). From this menu, we had the gnocchi and the pork pie. Both will not disappoint and you will not walk away hungry or breaking the bank!  The first floor is the restaurant. It's limited seating, at least from where we could see, so I'd say bookings would be essential. The food was outstanding. They have a great selection of seafood and it has a great Italian flavor to it. We had the meat platter for starters and there was a special of whole sole for a main. We ended up skipping dessert as we were full. My partner is still raving about the meal!  The second floor has rooms you can book to stay in. And then there is the rooftop which has its own separate grill based menu. The views are amazing, but we didn't get a chance to eat here.  The staff were amazingly attentive, friendly, and were more than happy to tell us about the area and point us in the direction of the Spitalfields Markets, Brick lane.  In all honesty, if we had known about this place when we were booking a hotel, we'd have stayed here as the rooms look amazing and come with breakfast. Next time we venture from Australia to London we will definitely be staying at the Culpeper. ", "date_of_review": "30 May 2016"}

We had just finished delicious starters (pork rillettes and cornichons, hummus salad and flatbreads) and were looking forward to our main courses, when a bloke wearing a backpack tried to sit at the table next to us. The spaces between tables is small, as in most London restaurants - unfortunately we didn't notice him until he had knocked both of our glasses of red wine and the rest of the bottle into my lap. His response was \"sorry\" and sat down fully intending to eat at the table next to me. He seemed to think it unreasonable of me not to want him to sit next to me and enjoy the meal he had prevented me from eating. It wasn't possible to stay - I was literally sitting in a whole bottle of red wine.  The staff were superb, calm, reassuring, brought me wet cloths and even wine stain remover to clean up (which had no chance of working given the amount spilt, but a thoughtful response).  What I hadn't realised until later as I went back to our hotel nearby and left my husband to pay was that they had waived our bill - not necessary, as it wasn't their fault, but a nice gesture.  And to the idiot who ruined both our evening and my clothes, if you must wear a back pack in London, even if you are one of those people who doesn't take them down in the tube, at least do so when you are squeezing into a restaurant table. And there are some \"mistakes\" as you called it, that \"sorry\" really isn't an adequate response for. ", "date_of_review": "31 May 2016"}

Unfortunately the rooftop has a different menu, more like a BBQ and you are not able to get a roast. This was fine though, we decided we would try it out up there anyway. We gave a phone number to the waitress who said she would text us when a table became available; that it would be up to an hour's wait.  Eventually over 80minutes later and starving we got a text message so headed back and up to the rooftop. We had to put together a table with the right amount of chairs for us ourselves which wouldn't normally be a problem but when you've already waited for so long you kind of expect them to have a table ready for you. We sat down and looked at the chalkboard menu next to our table. On the menu was about 4 different meats and then a vegetable section with choices of asparagus, potato salad, peppers, salads and then a choice of sauces too. The waiter came to take our order and pretty much everything we wanted, they had run out of. He said that we should be looking at the other menu at the other end of the roof because there was more available from that one. I normally expect to be told what is unavailable before it gets to the stage where you are ordering. In the end we all found some things to order.  In the meantime our drinks arrived and two of them were not what we had ordered. Then the food came. Between us, 4 of us had ordered the peppers. 4 halves of 2 peppers arrived with anchovies on them (this should said on the menu because one of our group was a vegetarian so then couldn't eat them). The waiter said that this plate was 2 portions. We waited another few minutes and then asked a different waiter if any more food was coming because we were still waiting for two peppers. He said he was sorry he had forgotten to tell us that they ran out of peppers halfway through cooking. My friend's sauce that she ordered also never turned up. I later went to use the toilet and there was no toilet rolls in any of the stalls (again this is not something that would normally bother me too much at all but alongside everything else it was just the icing on the cake)  The food that we had was tasty but portions were small and in my opinion not worth the price. We didn't pay our service charge and someone who I assume was a manager understood this and apologised but I don't think I will be heading back to the rooftop anytime soon.", "date_of_review": "17 May 2016"}

We came to the pub after 12pm and unfortunately all tables on the roof bar were taken. The hostess that was in charge of the roof bar seating said she will take our phone number and gives us a call when there is a free table. We waited about 30 min in downstairs\u2019 bar and then became suspicious because even people that came after us were called for a table at the roof bar. I went upstairs and asked the hostess what is happening. She said she sent us a text but we didn\u2019t turn up. Of course she noted my phone number incorrectly so I asked her to update it (repeated it) and she said she will give us a priority now. I also asked her to come downstairs to give us a shout just in case a text doesn\u2019t work again. There was no apology for taking the number wrong. Waited another 20 min and nothing. Went upstairs again, and hostess said that she sent us a text again (which neither of time I received). She then told me to go upstairs and check if any table is free which I did and luckily there was a table. Again, no apology whatsoever. Her attitude was almost like, oh well, it happened, so what. She also said she came downstairs to look for us which was a lie.  By the time we got to our lunch, they had only 2 main courses available out of 5. After we questioned the hostess what has happened the second time, she said she can\u2019t see our details on the system anymore and can\u2019t say what happened. Only at this point she said sorry which was in our opinion too late. We will definitely not be going back and we won\u2019t recommend the place as she nearly spoiled our Saturday afternoon and it could have been so simple to resolve.

This place looks stunning but is still homely and is still very much a pub - albeit a top quality establishment. A look at the ales on offer had me smiling right off. The understated and professional manager (Josh) knows his beer. He helped me to choose a Purity Ales IPA which was superb and well kept. Later he filled me in on the brewer and on the history of the pub. It's run by deeply impressive people - not just a bunch of wealthy show-offs. Upstairs is a quality restaurant with a tempting fine dining menu. If the food is only as good as what they serve in the bar it will be great. Our BLT and fries provided us with a delicious and well presented lunch that stopped short of being pretentious. The olives were also excellent. This, for me, is how to run a gastro-pub.

This is straight and muscular cuisine. But all was pleasant, cooked with dexterity and using good produce. The menu is short, clever and (for me) immensely appealing, with a section of plates for two to share. I was tempted by a starter of burrata with orange and Treviso radicchio but I went instead for duck hearts with Puy lentils. Lovely lentils, perfectly cooked, as was the meat. Very satisfying earthy dish. For main, I went vegetarian, with an interesting cauliflower based dish, slightly salty, but good. A pannacotta to finish was the star of the show: it was just perfect, wobbly and creamy and rightly sweet, the rhubarb and some shortbreads lovely accompaniments. This place reminds me of Brawn in terms of type and level of cuisine: if you like one you're likely to like the other. The room is large and cool. Service by our waitress was smiley, sweet and informed, and there was a similarly pleasant attitude by every other member of the team. Prices are right.

But the bar menu is a bit random and there was really only one 'proper' full meal but as it was battered cod and chips, we were more than happy. The rest of the items were really only bar snacks although you could make your own Culpeper version of Tapas I guess. Will try the restaurant next time and hopefully send out an Excellent review.

The noise level ever went too high, interior is very modern but not gorgeous: it's somehow minimalistic, but i really liked it. Selection of beer is \"ok\", but i was really attracted by the wine one: that is really good! After a quick drink we went upstairs at the restaurant: you'd better book as they don't have many tables and it appears to be always full, also during weekdays (and it was on a thursday evening). I'm not surprised: food here is awesome! And the service is courteous, extremely courteous. I'd really recommend to try the \"Burrata\" as starter. Seems like their chef mixes tastes and ingredients from everywhere in the world (they also have some \"Lardo di Colonnata\", a rare italian salumi) in quite a delicious way. It's not extremely cheap but you can't pretend their service and the best ingredients to come at a bargain price, honestly. I think i the value for money is good.

The roof garden gets very booked up and there is no communication between staff on different floors. We waited nearly two hours for a table upstairs, only to be told on arrival of the garden that there wasn't space (they put you in a virtual queue and text when to come up). After a bit of arguing with a slightly rude member of staff, they let us upstairs. There were at least 4 free tables, but we were told there was wasn't any space.

Better communication and clarity on their cluttered website would indicate that the roast isn't served all day and that if you come closer to 6 (when they stop serving the roast) then your options are likely to be limited if a roast is what you had your heart set on.  Sadly this happened to our party of four when we turned up and were told only one choice of roast was available. I think they could see that we were quite annoyed at this as our waitress had summoned the manager who took the blame for the poor communication and then went out of his way to accommodate is food wise.  I must say that despite the food being decent, our visit was made by our amazing waitress Nadia, who kept us laughing the whole way through and also showed off some of her wine knowledge letting us taste different ones until we found one we liked. We ended up having a good meal with a mish mash of different things from the roast menu and the rooftop menu all of which was very tasty.

This place is at the extreme end of gastropubbery as the food is cleverly prepared, well presented and very tasty. The wine list is interesting (beware the cloudy, unfiltered \"Pinot Grigio\" that isn't really like the Pinot Grigio that ever other establishment serves) and the prices seem reasonable and the craft beers are \"on trend\" with some interesting flavours. The refurbishment is tasteful and the place has an open and airy feel and a pleasant buz and the staff were all friendly, efficient and clearly enjoying themselves. However... I do think they are just a little bit \"trendy\" (in the not-so-good sense) in that they seem to have lost sight of the fact that in order to survive they are going to have to give customers what they want rather than what they would like to serve. Offering Sunday lunch without a beef option (other than a \u00a375 for 3-4 people) is probably not going to work in the long term in my opinion. So, this place deserves to succeed and I really hope they do as they are clearly passionate about what they do.

I chose the 3 pieces of cheese for my dessert and was very disappointed.The blue cheese was nice and creamy with a sharp taste but the others tasted as if they had been standing out for far too long as they were sweaty and a bit dry.The accompanying chutney was delicious.3 Small pieces of cheese for \u00a310 is I think over priced.I had cheese at Iberica the other week which knocked spots off this.The sea bass at \u00a320 looked good as did the rhubarb eaten by my friend who enjoyed both..The red wine at \u00a320 a bottle,Gassac Rouge was good value.So overall I think the food is skillfully prepared,well presented in a pleasant setting but in my view over priced.", "date_of_review": "1 April 2015"}

The beer and wine were very good but food not so. I would normally choose roast beef but the only beef on the menu was \u00a375 for a joint to share between 3 or 4 - not an option when just with my vegetarian girlfriend, so had no choice but to have pork. Which is fine but would rather have some choice. Complimentary bread with anchovy butter was an excellent free appetiser. My girlfriend obviously ordered the vegetarian roast, which when came was not a roast at all. Instead, it was a plate of new potatoes and burnt kale. She enjoyed the new potatoes but it wasn't what she was hoping for. See @ellaflo_xo for 4 tweet rant. My roast pork was fine - meat tender, roast potatoes crispy, Yorkshire pudding homemade, cauliflower cheese creamy but portions small and no other veg.  Overall, it was an average meal for above average price. Nice decor in the pub and decent service but for the price I'd expect more. Won't be going back. ", "date_of_review": "19 April 2015"}

Bills itself as a gastropub but it's one of those gastropubs that charges restaurant prices for mediocre food and small portions... in other words, the worst kind of pub. Went for Sunday lunch and ordered a roast chicken because it's the only roast they have - they pride themselves in doing only one roast each Sunday. But when the single roast is mediocre, the concept is laughable. This roast dish consist of one small chicken leg, a bit of red cabbage, a small Yorkshire (best part of the dish) and a good portion of roast potatoes. A couple of big problems with this dish 1) the chicken portion is tiny and is dwarfed by everything else on the plate - when the dish is called \"roast chicken\", one expects there to be a fair bit of chicken! 2) the chicken is just ok. The skin is not crispy but rather just dry. The meat is fairly juicy but not juicy enough.  the roast potatoes are a bit dry - I've had far better at other pubs. The final disappointment of this dish is it cost \u00a316. In order to get full, you have to order a starter and maybe a \"nibble\". Oh, and you can order a side of greens (where it is normally included in other Sunday lunches). We ordered \"pork popcorn\" and out came a measly portion of popcorn with a hint of pork scratching (needs more than a hint to make it worth the small portion that it is.- frankly, popcorn is not something to be measly about (it was less than a handful - and I have small hands).  An order of a \"large\" glass of wine is really a small in my book.  To sum up, when you are a pub serving Sunday lunch, you can't charge \u00a316 for a plate of roast chicken that leaves diners hungry after consuming the whole plate. That's just a crime.", "date_of_review": "19 October 2014"}

The starters were quite tasty, but simple and small. Our pork roast (they currently rotate the meats from week to week) meal was also quite tasty, however both my girlfriend and I both remarked that it was a bit too small (mainly the pork) and was seriously lacking some veg servings (veg was red cabbage and potatoes only, surely veg is the cheapest part of the meal - and what is a roast without some veg options?)... We assumed this was how they come, and as we aren't in the habit of complaining unless it's something more pressing we didn't let it bother us.  However, I was soon displeased when the table next to us had their pork roasts brought to them, containing noticeably larger portions of pork, and with each an additional extra-large potato. At the risk of sounding like a potato-counter, their meal was perhaps a third bigger than ours. A sunday pork-roast is my favourite meal of the week, so I was not impressed...However I didn't find an appropriate time or way to mention it without causing a scene (or coming across as a moany git). On this experience I probably won't go there again, which is a shame as the service was fair and the decor is quite interesting.", "date_of_review": "26 October 2014"}

Not only can you try new things but if you fancy a pie, or just chips you are in luck because they are both some of the best you will ever have. The bar staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and attractive so really what more could you want! The cocktails were both familiar but with a unique twist. Great wine list, wonderful beer both on tap and in the bottle. Their rooftop urban farm provides fresher than fresh vegetables and herbs for the menu, which in my mind is always a plus.

There were several problems that made this a really disappointing experience, which was a real shame as we had heard good things and we were really looking forward to going.  We had booked as a table of five and were clearly squeezed in on a much smaller table. That was after waiting 15 minutes to be seated. When we were eventually sat down, it took a further 15 minutes before we had to ask for menus.  It took well over an hour for our food to come out, it came out cold and it took a further ten minutes for them to provide us with gravy to go with our roast dinner. After already waiting an hour this was incredibly frustrating. As a table of five celebrating I felt that we were there for the overall experience as much as for the food, but this was totally ruined for us. There was no real sincere apology and no real service; we may as well have served ourselves.  The worst part was the woman working at the front, whose job title I can only assume is \u2018mindless wanderer\u2019.
