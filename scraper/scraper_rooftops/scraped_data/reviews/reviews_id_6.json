The design would have been very suited to 15 years ago. However nothing has changed. I don\u2019t think that people want to eat from a very limited (they only offer a choice of three puddings) menu in a drafty restaurant that\u2019s filled with loud, electronic, music. The meal itself whilst it would have been acceptable was vastly overpriced. All the sauces were gelatinous and very heavily seasoned. The red wine sauce my husband had with his steak had an \u201calmost burnt\u201d flavour. Not enough to complain about but not good. The charge for the steak was #29. For this you got a steak, some rather gelatinous sauce and six (6!) chips.  As I\u2019ve said we\u2019re staying here and haven\u2019t experienced the same problems with breakfast so I suspect that it\u2019s a problem with dinner rather than the actual restaurant. I don\u2019t have a problem taking breakfast here again as the main restaurant\u2019s not open but we won\u2019t be eating an evening meal here nor will we be recommending it.", "date_of_review": "23 October 2020"}

I then stood up to take a photo and got shouted at by the rude waitress again.  10 minutes before close we were finally brought our drinks that were just shoved on our table without letting us know what was what and then the manager and 2 waitresses proceeded to present a plate of fresh desserts and cake to a table nearby giggling, yet we were told the kitchen had closed an hour ago but it was obviously open for staff to feed their friends.... Absolutely appalling customer service and quite frankly embarrassing on their behalf.

I was mainly interested in coming for cocktails but since they do food I thought I\u2019d book a table for 7:30pm so that we could eat first and then stay on for some drinks after. I did not read the small print in my booking confirmation that tables are only reserved for one and a half hours. I do accept my fault in overlooking this. However I have never experienced a restaurant/bar venue that does not allow customers to stay on for drinks after dining there. It did not occur to me that I\u2019d need to make two separate reservations in order to prevent being kicked out so I didn\u2019t think to do this. So we turned up at 7:30 with just the one reservation. When they reminded us on our arrival that we only had the table for 90 mins I started to worry that we would indeed be kicked out after the meal and not able to stay on for drinks. So once we were seated I went back to the hostess\u2019 desk and asked her if we could stay for drinks since we were already dining. She rudely and brusquely responded \u2018We are fully booked\u2019. No apology, no nothing. Now, I\u2019m not expecting them to conjure a table for us out of thin air if they really are fully booked BUT I was shocked at her rudeness and she could have been a great deal more sympathetic and hospitable about it. Also, since we noticed tables were often empty for periods of time between bookings, I really think she could have tried to have been more accommodating if she wanted to, eg. seeing if there was a table we could have for just 45 mins. This is the sort of hospitality that I always would expect to experience at any \u2018high end\u2019 establishments like this. The hostess\u2019 rudeness shocked me so much that I returned to my table in tears and proceeded to cry silently for the next few minutes. Our food was really bad. The calamari appetiser was very good but the steak which I ordered was one of the worst I\u2019ve ever eaten: chewy with revolting chips. And very expensive too. When the waiter asked why I hadn\u2019t really eaten it and I told him I found it too chewy he didn\u2019t apologise. Once we finished dinner we were then asked to leave before the next booking arrived. All in all this place is overhyped, overpriced and rude, completely capitalising on their rooftop view (which by the way, wasn\u2019t even as advertised. They covered our section of the restaurant with a dingy grey roof cover, with just a small window left to even see the view. Not at all like the \u2018open air\u2019 PR photos). I wish that all the bad reviews on sites like Tripadvisor would actually have some effect and force this place to improve on how they run things. But sadly there will always be a steady stream of tourists and influencers queuing up to get their Instagram photos there, and so Radio Rooftop has little incentive to even care about their miserable ripped off customers.

We arrived at 4pm only to be told they have a over 21 only policy after 5pm. We stayed for a drink and snack before heading back out to North London to support a local restaurant instead. Very disappointed this was not explained on the phone. I would assume if we make a booking for 4pm for dinner the person making the booking should check the age or explain their policy just incase. Even the person on entry to the venue was a bit rude and just said \"well thats our policy\" when I ask for an explanation. I have looked at their website and it is stated on the bottom of their home page in small print. But I never looked there so overall only a 3 and that's for the waiter and the view.

I drank my Macchiato, paid \u00a34.50, and politely asked the waitress to remove the service charge (on a coffee!), and left.  If you nip into Covent Garden, which by the way is just around the corner, you will find absolutely fabulous restaurants for breakfast.  Thanks, but no thanks.", "date_of_review": "6 February 2020"}

There were 3 of us two of us 21 and one 18. When we arrived we were asked if we had a reservation in which we didn\u2019t. The lady asked us for our ages and then explained that it was an over 21 policy after 5pm. Which we completely understand but she spoke to her manger and they had said we could have a table for an hour and it was ok to go in although one was 18. We were seated at the bar ( which can I add there were plently of people who didn\u2019t have reservations that were allocated nice tables to sit at, I think this is very out of order to sit us at the bar out of the way when we would be paying the same as any other person in there that were having drinks)  We sat at the bar for around 15 minutes and the bar men behind the bar did not ask once if we would like a drink. We were then asked about 20 mins after being sat there to be told again that it was an over 21 policy and he would have to check with his manager if this was ok. By this point we had been sat there without a drink and made to feel VERY unwelcome. Your bar staff in particular were rude.  We completely understand that you have the over 21 policy in place and completely respect that but it was the fact we were told we could come in and have a drink to be sat there for 20 minutes and then be interrogated again about our ages. I know full well we look young but we did all have ID and me and my sister are in fact 21.

I was so convinced that my experience will be amazing. However upon reaching upstairs to the restaurant itself, I was so disappointed. I wanted to actually leave but we travelled far so we were obligated to stay. I was sat by a lady who handed me two menus (brunch menu and a la carte menu)...  Next thing I know another waiter came and demanded for my bank card. I asked him why as i already gave my bank details upon booking over the phone. He was so rude and told me its the policy and that I should know this. No one told me this when i booked it but i still gave him my card . He came again to take our drink order and i told him im not feeling well as i have flu, and if he could tell the bartender to put less ice in my drink. Again he was rude and said it always comes with ice . I've been to several rooftops in London and never experience such lack of hospitality . Upon having received our drinks we ordered our food with him and he said we could only order from the brunch menu .I asked him why as the lady who sat me down gave me two menus. I then asked him if the steak is beef or pork as i dont eat pork. He looked at me like I know nothing and said of course it's beef. After that another waiter took over as i think the other one had finished his shift.

Firstly, the lovely Finnish lady (Sala?) by the lifts always greets us with a the most warm welcome that it already makes you feel like you\u2019re coming \u201chome\u201d. It was just the third time that I met her but she already remembered and greeted me by name before I even mention my booking - this is hospitality in its perfection.  When we arrived at Radio, we didn\u2019t even say who we are, we simply were shown to our table-with-a-view. Nothing better than a seamless entry!  As a creature of habit, we ended up ordering the same food: the edamame was more tasty though and so were the deliciously creamy croquets! And there\u2019s nothing better than to finish with the divinely addictive churros.  Our waiters, Zsolt and Richardo, could not have looked after us any better: Zsolt always served us with a bright smile and recommended us a few other dishes. Richardo, is always as warm and friendly as ever.  But it\u2019s not only the waiters that looked after us all night - the management team also cared for us to no end. Fabio always comes over to greet us and have a chat with us even in the busiest period. Gleb always insist that he is at our disposal should we wish to request anything.  It is truly the people that make a place worth coming back again and again for. Ever since my friends and I came here for the first time at the end of March and certainly since the summer party, we\u2019ve been coming at least every month! I sincerely want to thank the entire team (Fabio, German, Gleb, Antoine, Angelo, Richardo, Samantha, Sala) for always being so welcoming and for your generosity and hospitality - and for making Radio feel like a second home.

This time we were very well looked after by the lovely Roberto: not long after we sat at the sofas he came to take our drinks order; we were never with an empty glass - it was always promptly topped up. The noticeable difference this time though was the taste of the food - every dish we ordered was a lot tastier: shrimps were crispy, edamame was very well seasoned, beef sliders were juicy, cheese platter was simply divine and the chips were oh so delicious (we tend to order the same favourite dishes!).  Fabio, who managed my entire party with perfection the last time, also came over to say hello to us.

We very much enjoyed the food which was served promptly (steak and the cod for mains) and the young male waiters who brought it out were very sweet.

Only 2-3 people in the queue upon arrival, however we were immediately told on the door they were 'fully booked'. There was no offer of a wait time, and my friend even asked if there was space to sit/stand the bar, to which there apparently was not.  A kind group of people who were waiting next to us in the queue offered us space at their (pre-booked) table, to which we accepted. When we got up there it was practically empty, and didn't exactly fill up throughout the evening, so the door staff had clearly lied.  All I have to say is by the looks of these reviews this kind of appalling service isn't a one-off, so this place seriously needs to consider their staff's treatment of customers in order to up their game. This place already seems to have a reputation for being pretentious, don't add to it by driving everyone away who is willing to come here and spend money.", "date_of_review": "9 August 2019"}

Me and my two friends (who both stayed with me at the Suite ME on the party night itself) went for a tasting session two weeks before the party!  I big thank you to the Manager: Fabio Dal Bosco who looked after us from the moment we did the tasting. When a dish was not quite to our liking, he listened to what we would have liked instead and came up with another dish that was just perfect. Then, me being fussy, asked for a special welcoming cocktail to be made, one that combines two of my favourite drinks: gin and champagne. Fabio came up with 3 different cocktails that were all to die for. We chose 2 and on the night, 160 of these delicious cocktails were consumed, even by guests who normally do not drink cocktails - testimony of how good they were!  We got our own special staff Angelo for the night who no doubt looked after us throughout the evening. Everything and I mean everything went smoothly. Fabio stayed above and beyond his hours, made sure the handover was smooth and even helped to ensure the living room was cleared and cleaned before he left. It transpires he even helped me friends with the whole surprise birthday cake. No guest was running out of drinks and yet no one was excessively drinking either - the team controlled the pace in such a beautiful way that I have never experienced. The food was divine. The venue is simply stunning. The compliments from my guests were endless and still came in a week after the party ended - such was the unforgettable night.  As a host I was able to spend my time with my honourable guests and this was only possible because Fabio and his team made sure the rest was taken care of.  Thank you so much for such a perfect and memorable birthday Radio team - it could not have been any better! ", "date_of_review": "4 August 2019"}

The email said dress was smart, which we did - but others were in ripped jeans, trainers and t-shirt. What is the point of having a dress-code then not applying it? We were sat at a table with no view - the whole point of going to the rooftop bar for us was to have a nice (birthday) meal with a good view over London. We didn't get that at all. We were sat on a deep sofa with a low (knee high) table. This made it hard to eat comfortably. We were overlooked by the waiters. Other couples/groups were asked several times throughout our short time how they were but the waiters seemed to ignore us unless we managed to catch their eye. We ordered the Mexican sharing platter which was very expensive (as were all the meals). Due to the expense we were expecting more than a bag of cheap brand Doritos that had not been heated nor had any cheese as the nachos, but that is what we got (we asked for no jalapenos). The dips were nothing special, nor the quesadillas. The platter also had 4 chicken skewers (2 of good size, the other two very small pieces of chicken) and then tons of pepper things (I am assuming these are very cheap). All in all, I would expect to pay no more than \u00a35 for something of this size and quality at a restaurant (especially as I could probably 'make' the nachos from a 50 p bag of crisps) - not the \u00a327 that it unfathomably cost. We were still hungry after this plate but decided to cut our losses and find somewhere else to finish our meal. We asked for the bill and to add insult to injury a service tip had been applied.

There's a lift and when there is security on the door you may not be lucky enough to get through lol!

But then it's London, it's a great bar & restaurant and the view ... well, we'll come back to that later. 3) Service isn't great. But then we weren't spending big like some of the other parties there - and that's just how these expensive bars work I guess - and we did get served ok in the end. We were rather bluntly told a couple of times by a hostess to move as the area we were in was reserved, but the final time it happened the hostess was charming and we forgave them! Now the positives: 1)Wow! What a view! You get a 290 degree view across one of the most impressive cities in the world, and if you stay long enough for this to turn from day to night you will never forget it! 2) Although pricey, the food was great. We had a sharing platter and it was really tasty. 3) You do get the feeling you are mixing with rather wealthy people (not least because some of the groups there did appear to be a little pretentious) and that makes you feel a bit more up market, a bit more special.

You have to book a few weeks in advance but once your here although the table stay are meant to be an hour and a half at the weekend we stayed for seven hours yesterday and managed to move on three different tables ...  Our first table was a small cosy bistro table overlooking theatre-land and beyond . Our beautiful waitress was a student from Peru We ordered two Long Island Teas but too be honest they where a bit weak so I wouldn\u2019t bother , I did mention it to our waitress but she just said sorry . However her recommendation for a Rose wine was perfect yes it was \u00a340 a bottle and we had a couple but what the heck , think it was called Ultimate Provence 2018 .  Food wise at the weekend there is only the brunch menu plenty of choice for everyone , we had the Radio Bar Burger with fries and the lobster sandwich on a brioche bun so very light served with sweet potato fries . Each dish around \u00a320 so not overpriced especially when you take in the surroundings .  So it\u2019s a very smart but casual setting with a mixture of outside and inside seating areas I don\u2019t believe you can reserve tables but just ask when booking . Everything is centred around the huge bar area Where if you just wanted to sit at the bar you can ....  whilst roasting for a few hours we decided to move inside to cool down for a while and found ourselves next to the dj stand .. good music although a bit trancee for me I\u2019m a Luther girl myself ... I then asked another waiter to find us a table on the other side of venue , which he did so now we are outside overlooking the Shard , St Paul\u2019s and the Thames . This is where we hit the Gins and Vodkas and the Olives ... again price wise is always gonna be a bit over the top but worth every penny . Fab venue , excellent location , great food and a great vibe . The staff are extremely helpful .

She brushed me off and told me to keep my seat and wait my turn.. the sass came out of no where and we never saw her again. In the coming 2 hours we proceeded to watch about 5 groups in the same lobby get called up to elevator where my father and I just sat and watched. He caused a scene and we left.

It took ages for the cocktails to arrive, the food even longer, and the pot of tea longer still. When it arrived, the menu was the standard menu, expecting the pescatarian to eat ham, the person with citrus allergies to eat lemon pie, orange biscuits and cake, and a strawberry/tequila & lime jelly. When we questioned the waiter, he tried to assure us that there was no citrus. We ask him to check with the chef... twice! The third time another member of staff came to our table and was told that the lemon pie did have lemon in it, and the orange cake and biscuit did in fact have orange in them. He still insisted that the jelly didn't have lime in it. Why have it on the menu saying lime if it doesn't have lime in it. It did contain lime!

Not an issue since the Ma\u00eetre was really nice and find a sit for us quickly. I wanted to treat my mum to a typical afternoon tea since she was visiting from abroad and I could not have chosen a worse place.  The service was beyond bad, we ordered afternoon tea not only they did not bring sugar for the coffee, no cutlery ,no water.. but the waitress did a pretty ugly gesture when I asked her for plates. When she came back , she was only bringing one. The staff in general did not know the number of the tables so they approached us 9 times to ask if that was the food we ordered, 9 times !! I spent 60 pounds which is more that 70 euros to eat ham and cheese sandwiches (2) stale scones and rancid biscuits. It totally ruined the whole experienced for me and my mum. I honestly just wanted to leave as soon as possible. We were uncomfortable from the beginning. I spoke to the manager to share my experience and I honestly felt he was not even listening. I have gone for afternoon tea before and never had such an awful experience. This is not way I had expected from a ''5 star'' hotel. I would not recommend this place to anyone.

", "comment": "We googled after noon tea in London and the first place to pop up was Radio Rooftop in London. We reserved an outside table to have tea several weeks in advanced. We were in town to attend my Wife\u2019s Uncles funeral and wanted to spend some time in London and enjoy tea and a view. This was our first dining experience in London. When we arrived to the restaurant we were told there were no seats available outside for the view. Instead sitting us near the bar but close to the front entry. We were disappointed but didn\u2019t complain. The hostess said as soon as a spot was open outside she would move us. She proceeded walking by us 20 times. How do We know? Well we know as 20 of those times it was to take others outside to tables after we were told there was nothing available. We listened in on many asking to be moved outside and some didn\u2019t even have reservations. Several times she made eye contact with us when she walked by and could tell she knew what we were thinking. Then it took over 1.5 hours to get our tea and food, which consisted of a tray of simple foods. Nothing cooked just some little sandwich cut outs, rolls with butter and jelly and some small deserts. At the end of the terrible experience we spent 85 pounds. 9 pounds for a bottle of water. 85! For tea and a tray of crap snacks to be honest.  Best part was when the waiter first came to our table we were asked to put a credit card down before we ordered. They gave us a key to retrieve our cc when we left. We didn\u2019t understand why but obliged thinking it was the norm. Again, literally the first place we had chosen to sit down and eat at in London. After our terrible service, slow attention, and on our way out we asked why we had to put down a cc. We were told that some don\u2019t pay their bills and sometimes they ask in advanced when there is concern.  So, we didn\u2019t get put outside because we looked like we were going to dine and dash? Is that why we were put in area where they could watch us? Do we look that shady? Married couple with English accents in their 40\u2019s? We didn\u2019t argue, didn\u2019t complain, just paid and left.  It was our worst experience we have ever had traveling. We weren\u2019t dressed like slobs just casual and others came and went in various outfits. Only thing we could think of us we weren\u2019t local? They should be ashamed of themselves!

Booked. After entering building the wow effect of cleanliness and black marble done its job and during trip in elevator we expected more and more wows. And we recieved them. Beautiful bar, beautiful decor, beautiful views and very polite host took us to our table and we start enjoying beautiful views and enjoyed bit of spring sun. Than, our waiter appeared. Hi how are you...  So far everything went well. We ordered couple of drinks and olives. Drinks arrived..wine perfectly chilled, cocktail perfectly refreshing. Ohhh thats great that's exactly what we were looking forward.  We already looked into the menu and we have choosen our starter, mains, sides. Olives nowhere to be seen. Well, I have to grab the waiter and ask about our olives. \"Ohhh we don't have\": was his answer. Fantastic. What else you don't have. Waiter just say three items, I hardly understand what is he saying. At least he brought some puffed corns. Little effort, just throw it on table without word. Than my glass was empty... And was still empty... 10 Ten us number of minutes while I was sitting there with empty glass. Not that I was hungry, i am thirsty again. Waiter nowhere, no question if we are ready to order some food. If we want another drink.  3. 3 is number of tables occupied at lunch time 12:30-12:45 5. Five is a number of total guests. 4. Four is number of staff which we have seen during our hour. host, maitre d, waiter, and bartender. 0. Zero is a number how many f....s you gave about us. Does really no one care, we were asking each other. 1. One is a number of minutes of how long I want to spend here any longer I have made my mind.  ---- Guys, we are hard working people, we do the same job as you and just wanted bit of respect and dignity. We were looking forward to spend time and money at your establishment. I was always curious when I got complaint from customer that we have ruined their day with our mistakes.

I spotted a pink gin on the menu so ordered that, but they'd ran out of that so i opted for a Sipsmith gin, I assumed the price of \u00a313.00 would include a tonic, but no there was a charge for that on the bill along with a service charge too. The said tonic was warm, seriously this is the sort of thing that should never happen in a well run bar.

I challenged her and said that if she expected us to order food and drink and then move in less than 30 minutes time that wasn't acceptable. After a debate on the poor service and they way we were expected to order but be moved around she said we could stay there and she would move the table bookings around to accommodate us. So either she wasn't telling the truth in the first place or some poor guest who had booked the table wouldn't get what they booked. I decided after such poor service we would leave as they didn't deserve the custom, especially at the prices they charge. When leaving I informed the woman at the main entrance that we were not staying due to the way we were treated, she shrugged her shoulders and said ok. Instead we went to STK underneath, it was like day and night, so accommodating and very polite. Radio needs to put staff on the same training that STK does. Pretentious staff who have no customer care or service.  I just hope the person in charge takes note and removes these staff and hire staff who care as I wont be coming back.", "date_of_review": "19 February 2019"}

They were busy and we ordered our food and drinks. They had a reduced Brunch menu for Sunday lunch and could not order off the full menu. Despite the reduced menu they had already run out of 2 of the main courses. We ordered 2 x steak and chips. 1st arrived after a while. The waitress expressed surprise when I asked if it was the medium or medium rare steak. Obviously only one steak order had made it to the kitchen. After about 5 minutes I signalled for the waitress who had taken our order to come over. I told her the delay was not acceptable. I told her that my girlfriends steak would be cold by the time mine arrived and that I did not want to pay for my late steak. She responded with \u201coh, so you don\u2019t want the steak then!\u201d I told her I wanted it but did not want to pay. She then came back after about 5 minutes and said that my steak would be another few minutes and that I would not need to pay for it. Another 10 mins and my steak eventually arrived. I asked for the manager to come and see us. My chips were very under cooked as if they had been rushed. When the manager arrived she gave the excuses of she was trying to manage 2 sections on top few staff. I told her that should not be my problem and maybe if they could not cope they should not accept bookings from customers. She was hardly apologetic, so I told her I did not want to pay for either meal and asked for my credit card back.

The atmosphere is fairly laid back and the venue has some decent views over London. Construction work was going on throughout our visit, with one side closed off and workers wandering through with materials. It appeared as though awnings were being installed. I would have expected that a timing for this could have been found that wouldn't interrupt lunch.  We ordered a selection of starters to share between the four of us. One of which was bread, which consisted of three slices. I would have expected that having explained that this was for four that an additional slice would have been included or advice provided that we might want to order more. The plates that we used for starters were left on the table after they were finished with and remained there whilst we were eating our main course. The waiter recommended the Sea Bass for the main course, which one of our party ordered. It arrived overdone and was returned. The other food was fine, but nothing special and not worth a premium. Tap water was provided for the table in individual glasses and these were not refilled throughout the meal. The drinks that we ordered were all good, but when one item wasn't available, an alternative was brought instead of checking with the guest first. All in all, I wouldn't go back to Radio for food. The bar service looked OK and so I would consider this a decent place to go for a drink and experience the views.

Initially we ordered tap water for the table whilst we chose cocktails. We sat down for the first half an hour, sitting looking at the menu, trying to catch someone's eye. It took the first quarter of our 2 hour sitting to even order our drinks, at which point I'd had to chase the waiting staff to ask them to take our order. This continued for the entire evening. On every occasion we ordered, we had to physically stand and find a member of staff, then waited about 20 minutes until they actually came. On one occasion we even ordered at the bar because we got so fed up of waiting. The tap water took 2 hours to eventually come, after about 4 reminders. On another note, I asked whether the espresso martinis were vegan. The waitress returned to say that they weren\u2019t. I asked if the cocktail could be made vegan, given that a couple of us are vegan guests and the answer was a straight no. On the basis that a classic espresso martini contains coffee liqueur, espresso and vodka, this really didn't seem unreasonable. When you are paying almost \u00a320 for a single drink, you would expect excellent service and exemplary quality. The service was entirely non-existent and the overall quality of the experience was just not there. Needless to say, we asked for service to be removed from the bill. The waitress seemed utterly shocked by this which was both rude and ridiculous, given that service should definitely not be expected. When the bill eventually came, it was over \u00a340 too much, which quite frankly, was the final straw. It was totally laughable that when I originally booked, there was a minimum spend of \u00a340 per head. How on earth can guests be expected to spend this much when orders aren\u2019t even taken!! It is such a shame because this bar has such great potential in both location, views, drinks and quality.

I had booked this for my friends birthday, as part of the celebration I also booked a table at Radio, this is the bar that is next to STK and part of the same group.  I made the STK booking through Opentable which was painless, but booked Radio over the phone. I booked Radio over the phone because our group was all blokes and I wanted to ensure that we would get in as it was my friends birthday. I know what most clubs policies are around all male groups and wanted to avoid any issues. On the Friday before our booking, I was called to confirm my booking for STK and then for Radio, when this call came through I once again reiterated the fact that we were an all male group. I was assured that this would not be a problem as we had booked a table and as long as we were in before 11 this would not be an issue. By the time Saturday came around, our party had reduced from 8 to 6 people. Upon arrival at STK we were running around 10 minutes late, we walked past Radio and I mentioned to the lady on the door that we may, therefore, be 10 minutes later for our reservation at Radio. She asked me, \u201cAre you a mixed group of 8?\u201d I explained that we were now down to 6 and that we were an all male group. At which point she shook her head and said that we probably wouldn\u2019t be allowed in without a mixed group. I proceeded to explain about our booking and that it was my friends birthday etc. She said that as long as we were all smartly dressed and gave the door staff no reason to not less us in, we would be fine. However, alarm bells had started ringing for me due to her attitude, so I contacted a group of friends to see if they would come along so that we would have a mixed group.  When we arrived at STK, no one greeted us or made an effort to seat us, we had to ask several waiters before one of them pointed out the front desk. Once we spoke to the desk we were seated quickly. The food was good, but if you are going for food there is a lot of places in London that offer better food at a significantly lower price. The atmosphere was great and the DJ was brilliant. The real issue is that there seemed to be a significant lack of staff, both waiters and bar staff. This meant that ordered any food or drinks was painfully slow. When the final bill came, this was \u00a3140 per person, without starters or deserts.  After dinner we headed to Radio, once the hostess saw myself and our group, she immediately asked me to come for a chat, surrounded by 4 members of security who were all staring me down. She advised that despite us now having a mixed group we would not be allowed into the venue for security reasons. When I asked why, she said she was not willing to disclose that information. Effectively, she did not like the look of our group, despite us all being smartly dressed and having a table reservation we were turned away for no reason. I would go so far as to say that this was blatant discrimination due to the appearance of our group and some of our backgrounds. I think it is fair to say that this is completely unacceptable from any establishment to discriminate like this.  I understand that clubs reserve the right to refuse entry to individuals / groups especially when they are intoxicated etc however, none of us were, we were all smartly dressed and we had a table reserved. It is extremely disappointing to have our night and my friends birthday ruined by this blatant discrimination.", "date_of_review": "22 August 2018"}

I called them in the morning to ask to book a table but was told that for 2 people we didn't need to, just show up, if it was a group of 5 or something then we would but it would be fine. I asked if it would be busy around 5:30 and was told that it would probably be getting busy but should be OK. So we turned up there at about half 5 and was directed through the hotel to the lift area. We were immediately asked by the lift attendant if we had a booking, to which I replied no - and she said she would need to radio up to see if there was room for us. Not a problem necessarily. But what happened next should have been a massive sign! The lift opened and was full of people all coming out of the lift. Again, not a problem, but in hindsight can see completely why this happened. We were the only people there waiting to begin with, but after about 10 minutes waiting there was a group of about 15 people all waiting to go up to the rooftop. Now we are 30, we are well past the feeling of having to wait around outside bars to get in, it doesn't mean it shows exclusivity, it's just annoying! So eventually we were told we could go up. There was 3 lifts and the lift attendant pressed the call button, the middle lift opened. She told us that only the left hand side lift went up to the roof top bar. But the left hand side lift never opened! So we waited more, every so often pressing the call button, and every time the middle or right hand side lifts were opening! Eventually we got in the middle lift which did in fact go straight to the rooftop bar - surely a lift attendant should know what lift to go to... When we arrived at the bar, again we were asked if we had a reservation - no. Based on what we were told next, I am suprised that the bar has any customers. They said that there was a minimum spend of \u00a350 PER PERSON and you could spend 2 hours on the rooftop. I said that first of all we don't want to be here for 2 hours - only one of two drinks before our show, but even if we did want to spend all evening here, after spending \u00a3100+ between us, would we be escorted out?! The hosts had such a bad attitude about the whole thing, you could tell that this is a conversation that they have very regularly.  One of their responses was \"oh well the cocktails start at \u00a315 so it's not that much to spend...\" - and yes, whilst we were prepared to pay the premium for the venue, \u00a315 is still a lot for a cocktail, especially when you're pushed to spend \u00a3100 between you in 2 hours! Out of the lift of 20 or so people, not one stayed. The bar completely missed out on all of our custom by their archaic rules. Londoners expect value for money or at least when they are paying more, the service should be exceptional. The bar had many opportunities to explain their ridiculous rules - either on the phone in the morning, or the lift attendant, or just a sign by the lifts would have sufficed. If they continue to operate the same they will definitely not last, and it can be seen by the numerous negative tripadvisor reviews that this is a regular occurrence. We spoke to the doormen of the hotel on our way out who explained that the bar and hotel were operated by different people but that everyone was well aware of the problems with the rooftop bar. They need to completely re-think their strategy. We ended up crossing over the road and having a few drinks in a great London pub instead. There are numerous alternatives to go to and I would urge you to steer clear of here.", "date_of_review": "7 August 2018"}

I ended up at the ME hotel with a friend maybe a few months after it opened. It was a bank holiday and I was reasonably casual smart (although I had some shorts on). We didn't come particularly for the roof bar so we spent a shed load in the downstairs bar on cocktails. At some stage I tried to go up to the roof and was refused on the basis that it was \"full\". My friend tried minutes later and was granted access. He cam back 10 minutes later and said it was empty up there. The difference between me and my mate? I'm black and he's white. Go figure. Over the years I've been back there and was refused access at least twice by the door lady. No rational treason given. I eventually got up there maybe three years ago after thinking that it must be the trendiest spot in London. It really isn't that great. Overpriced drinks and really poor service. I was tasty there on the day of the last Royal Wedding. Loads of people in shorts. Not trendy at all. The one constant? Overpriced drinks and poor service. Guys.

We were informed of a \u00a330 per head minimum charge and advised to book in advance which we did. On arrival in the hotel lobby we had to wait for 20 minutes in a queue for the only lift up to the bar. A member of staff at the head of the queue was checking each name against a booking list and turning those without bookings away. But unfortunately this was not disseminated to the other end of the queue! As a result numerous groups queued for 15-20 mins for nothing!  Once on the roof, we were met by a waitress who informed us that we would have to wait 15 minutes for our first drink and 45 minutes for any food. We immediately began to make plans to eat elsewhere. Eventually our drinks did arrive; 10 unopened bottles of beer, without glasses (despite us requesting them) and no bottle opener. It took another 5 minutes for the waiter to find us one so we could enjoy our small bottles of beer. Everyone at the surrounding tables seemed to be experiencing the same poor levels of customer service; it was hopelessly disorganised and we left after 1 1/2 hours having had 3 beers which, due to the minimum charge of \u00a330 per head, cost \u00a310 each!

First piece of advice though is either book or come as soon as it opens, as two of us arrived just after it opened and had real trouble getting a table, although finally we were given a table for 2 (even though we told them our third friend was on her way and there were countless empty tables, which were, apparently, \u201creserved\u201d). The views from here are excellent and on a barmy, summer evening it was very relaxing to sit and chat and gaze out over the city. The service itself was not that good \u2013 very slow and inattentive at times, which, for an establishment such as this, was not expected. However, the cocktail menu offers up some interesting options and the drinks themselves are very good (and priced at around \u00a315 each). Our friend arrived later but had awful trouble trying to get in as security stopped her from even getting in the lift \u2013 even though she told them she was meeting us. We asked one of the waitresses to speak on the phone to security downstairs to confirm we were here, but she said it was not up to her (which was not very helpful). Eventually after several calls down (which took over about 15 minutes), they let her in. There were still lots of empty tables so we tasked if we could sit at one of the bigger tables (as we were going downstairs in less than half an hour for our meal and all these tables had been reserved the whole time we were there, yet nobody was actually sitting in them) we were told we could, which we did, and when we left for dinner (2 \u00bd hours after we had arrived \u2013 all those reserved tables were still empty!) I would suggest they take bookings in time-slots or allow people in to sit at the reserved seats with the understanding they would have a limited time until the people who reserved actually turned up. I would also suggest that if a member of a party joining people already inside arrives later there is a simple system to let them come in.

After 15 minutes of waiting we got someone's attention who was stood idle, and he too promised to bring them right out. Over 10 minutes later we saw him taking an order for someone else so asked a third member of staff where our drinks were and her first remark was to ask us to move seats as the section we were directed to initially was apparently 'not open' for another 2 hours. We happily obliged her request and then sat and waited for yet another 10 minutes for her to eventually bring our drinks.

You're then escorted to your seat, ignored for 15 minutes, then another employee with a laptop comes to check you really do have a booking, then you're ignored for 10 further minutes before a waiter comes with a menu. He comes back 10 minutes later, takes the order, you wait 15 more minutes the the world's worst G&T arrives already topped up with tonic with 2 ice cubes. I've had better in a pub ! Getting the waiters attention to pay is impossible, so just left ! As I imagine many people do. This is style over substance, poor drinks service run by stressed staff who clearly hate being there.

Whilst celebrating my hen do we enjoyed some drinks in radio food top , we then had a reservation down stairs in STK.  We spent well over \u00a31,000 in both upstairs and downstairs and decided to return to see our friends on the table they had booked upstairs which we were previously on to enjoy the rest of the night. It was not late by any means at this time and others were allowed to proceed upstairs. We were denied entry and all left to feel embarrassed and humiliated by the incredibly rude staff. I also complained to the manager on duety this evening but still I was told it was a security process. Determined to not let this ruin the night we proceeded back to STK to have some drinks. The bar men then added a service charge on to serve our own drinks at the bar ( baring in mind we had already paid \u00a380 service charge for our table)  When questioning this we were told it\u2019s only \u00a315!!!  The staff are seriously lacking in customer service. It seems as though they are trying to be a high class luxurious venue but seriously failing. I have visited the highest level of service hotels across the world and the staff bend over backwards. Unfortunately this place has got it all wrong, by speaking to your customers appallingly it doesn\u2019t make them want to try harder to be given entrance to your bar!  I was left exstreamly shocked and on such a memorable occasion it was a real shame your staff spoiled this for me!  I will never ever return to this bar !", "date_of_review": "8 May 2018"}

If you find yourself with a guest of the hotel the staff make every accommodation to seat you at a table of your preference (inside or outside) and this I think makes the difference from other reviews I have read - and other experiences of frustration with waiting times.  The staff can be very busy with the numerous guests ordering cocktails, but of my many experiences; attentiveness is overall good if you have a degree of patience and understanding. What impressed me most is that irrelevant, the staff are friendly, happy, and the managers get involved with waiting and wiping tables - there seems to be a conscious team effort.  Prices are what you would expect from a rooftop bar in central London: \u00a315+ for cocktails, and \u00a340-45+ for wine.

Im a 50yr old professional businessman who travels extensively and stays in top draw hotels... Im not a 20 or 30 something with a big budget and probably on the way to a club or making a night of it with copious \"champs\" .. Id prefer to be able to talk to the person sitting opposite me and not shout at them... I dont feel the need to go to a bar in my best party clothes (smart is good and required but not club clothes) and I certainly dont feel the need to have a bit of a dance as I walk past the DJ and at random times as the next dance track blasting through the bar temporarily makes any other form of communication impossible. (next time Id take a pad and write notes to my wife it would make things a lot easier). This gets INSANELY busy but considering the location Im not surprised.  If you want a table do like us and book ahead otherwise \"youre on the list\" at virtually any time and especially after dark Drinks are expensive as youd expect in this type of place but its a captive audience for this type of place so to be expected.

On our very fleeting trip to London recently to celebrate a 40th birthday, we made a special trip across the city in search of this venue, looking forward to enjoying the views, which I believe are spectacular. However, the very rude girl standing next to the lift looked us up and down with disgust and advised us the bar is \u2018residents only\u2019 and just like that we were ushered away\u2026.  Firstly, it\u2019s not residents only \u2013 that\u2019s a fact. Secondly, no human being should ever treat another in this way. It is absolutely despicable customer service and I am shocked that the Melia group allow a bar in one of their establishments to be operated in this way. I have stayed in Melia hotels and I am a member of the rewards scheme. I have also visited and stayed in numerous other high end hotels, restaurants and bars, and I have never experienced such treatment. Thirdly, we weren\u2019t flouting any dress code (we were smartly dressed having just been to the theatre) and we are well educated, professional people who would happily have spent a considerable amount of money in this establishment, if we had been given the opportunity.  The management really need to get a handle on this issue. Perhaps we are just the wrong side of thirty and don\u2019t meet Lift Lady\u2019s idea of what their customers should be (I\u2019m thinking perhaps TOWIE, Made in Chelsea, reality star wannabes\u2026.). Lift Lady - please stop looking down your nose at people wanting to spend their money and enjoy the views in this venue. You are no better than anyone else and they are no better than you, treat people with the respect you would expect to receive yourself. Management - you really need to train your staff in customer service. Reading other reviews on here, this treatment is clearly far from being a one off and it needs to stop. Lift Lady ruined a birthday. We certainly won\u2019t be returning and have already advised friends, family and colleagues to stay well clear.", "date_of_review": "22 November 2017"}

We were asked if we had a reservation which we didn't so were seated at the bar. It was a lovely sunny afternoon so we were disappointed there were no available tables outside since this was why we had chosen the bar. We did of course understand that management need to prioritise tables for guests who have reserved them so we took to our seats at the bar and ordered our cocktails.  We stayed about 40 minutes and during this time a large section of the seated area outside was not in use. On leaving I asked the bar manager why we couldn't have sat there. He explained the area was not open until after a certain time and that it was reserved and there would be a lot of work involved to open it up to guests present now to then make it useable afterwards for other guests. I found this disappointing logic, guest experience is not worth opening up the outside seating area because there is extra work involved? I asked what work this would entail beyond wiping tables and plumping a few cushions. He took offence at this point and called me rude but failed to provide any examples of the additional work involved. I appreciate not opening up the outside seating area may not be his decision in which case he should have explained he would pass my comments on to management. He could have handles the situation with professionalism, I would have expected this from a high end bar but received superior customer service at Weatherspoons. If this decision is that of General Manager Andrew Crofts, to quote Andy in response to another trip advisor review 'we do our best to accommodate quest request for table moves'. Is this doing your best? Could you do better? Considering the unique selling point of the venue is the view from the outside seating area, you must understand why guests who visit for this very reason, who don't get seated outside but witness empty seats for the duration of their visit are not getting the experience they are paying for?

The search brought up the Radio Rooftop Bar and despite reading a couple of negative reviews (\"rude\", \"pretentious\", \"overpriced\" etc), I am always willing to give places the benefit of the doubt and pass judgement for myself so along with my sister thought it was worth a visit.  On arrival we were asked if we had a reservation, we said no, and without passing any further comment as to whether a reservation was actually needed we were shown onto the lift. Just behind us two other couples arrived and they too were asked if they had reservations, they didn't either. I think we all had the same idea that we might not be able to get a seat but if we can then great, happy days.  Being the first people on the lift meant that we were the last people out and so the other two groups got served before us. There was nobody on hand to say who arrived first and nobody made any attempt to find out. I accepted this as an easy mistake to make but one that could have been easily averted by having a single member of staff take the lift with the new customers.  The bar service was not the quickest, I know cocktails take longer to make but the bar was far from busy and we were seated at the bar for around 15 minutes before we could place our order.  The cocktails were very good, and although a bit pricey I don't mind paying more if the overall experience is a good one. Sadly the quality of the drinks was overshadowed by a business model that dismisses the casual impromptu visitor. We asked to be seated outside on the terrace and we were told that was not possible, unless something became available. There were seats available, but we were not allowed to use them. Apparently, those empty seats are not allowed to be used until after 7pm, so having a booking isn't even going to guarantee you a seat. The staff orders were clear but completely devoid of any reasoning and rationale. I hadn't even decided whether I wanted to stay for another cocktail before the bill was put in front of me (I guess the staff were a step ahead of me). I put my card on the tray provided. Another 15 minutes passed before my payment was accepted and I could finally leave. There was another couple sat to my right hand side that had also been kept waiting to place their order. At a snails pace, their order was taken and I wished them a better experience than what I had. It's a nice modern bar, the view is very good, and the drinks were good, sadly my own experience of the customer service was not. Aside from the service being slow, no effort was made to make the customer feel valued and welcome. I would probably still recommend this for large group bookings as I imagine they would be treated differently. If you're just in a group of 2, I'd honestly forget it whatever the weather.

We did ask if we could sit down until the guests who had made reservations arrived, as one of our friends is pregnant, but we were told no as they were all reserved. It would be helpful to have a sign that stated the time the reservation is from to allow other customers the opportunity to enjoy the views and have a seat if no one is even sat there.  Coupled with this the service charge that is added to the bill was definitely not warranted. The bar tender got the order wrong and gave us a bottle of red wine instead of white and when I took it back he told me rudely that I'd ordered red. I wouldn't order red when I don't drink red. He then asked if it was the same price, I said I wasn't sure (it's not my job to know the price of the drinks) so he looked at the menu and said yes, they were the same price and swapped the red for a bottle of white.  When I looked at the menu to double check, the red was actually more expensive. So along with paying a service charge for bad service, I also got charged extra for the bar man getting my order wrong. I paid around \u00a38 for absolutely nothing. My friends encouraged me to get this refunded but I felt too embarrassed to go back and complain. This is the issue with this bar, it is very pretentious and you are made to feel like an idiot if you complain (bar man adamantly telling me I ordered red wine when I don't drink red wine). If I had been sat at a table and had asked for table service I would be more than happy to pay a service charge, providing they got my order correct. However, to hand over a bottle of wine, manage to get that wrong and then blatantly lie about the price difference and not refund this, accepting a service charge is quite frankly disgusting and very bad customer service.

If you are not then unfortunately there's not much point in going.  The cocktails are approximately \u00a314 and are average.  Service is poor to say the least. Staff are inattentive and somewhat rude. We ordered chips and waited for 30mins before we had to ask a waiter how long they would take to arrive to which he apologised and said he would find out and then never returned. We asked for the bill numerous times and it never came. We eventually got fed up of waiting and paid at the bar.

Table was booked for 18:00-20:00 and due to bad weather and traffic thought we would be 20 mins late. So at 17:45 (15 minutes before booking time and whilst in taxi) phoned the Radio Rooftop to explain that we were running late but would definitely be there around 18:20. The obnoxious guy on the phone said that they could not keep our table more than 15 minutes and it was tough luck if we got there Late as they were full and the next people booked would take out table. I tried to explain that was the reason why I phoned but he said there was nothing he could do and put he phone down.  As it happened we arrived at 18:15 and once there had great service, good music and a great selection of cocktails and drinks.  I would have rated this 5 stars for ambience and location and service except for the telephone experience. It is for that reason that I would not recommend it to friends or colleagues and not go back.  Sad because it is a great place spoilt by pettiness and inflexibility by the person that answers the phone. ", "date_of_review": "12 July 2017"}

Upon arrival the entrance staff left us waiting, preferring instead to talk amongst each other. As there was no one in line I would have expected a greeting within seconds, this did not happen. After a long wait for the lift we were shown to our table on the terrace. After seating we were left unattended to for around 10-15 minutes, no one seemed interested in taking our order, so eventually we summoned a member of staff.  A short while later it started to rain, annoyingly our table appeared to be the only one not covered by the retractable canopy. We grabbed our food and drinks and asked where we could go, assuming that there would be a backup plan in place as London is famed for it terrible weather. Instead, we were met with bemused staff who didn't really know what to do. The temporary solution was to sit at another table with a group of strangers, with no offer of assistance from the staff to help carry our multiple food and drinks - we did that ourselves. Ten minutes later we were directed to a table inside, again, no offer of help to carry our food and drinks. After being seated for a third time we were not approached by staff for another 20 minutes, again summoning someone to order. At this stage we had been in the bar for 1 hour 15 minutes and had only ordered one bar snack (between 5 people) and one drink each. As the service seemed to be infrequent and inattentive we decided to order multiple drinks at a time as we were conscious the two hour limit was fast approaching. At this point it became apparent that the only way to get service offered to you is to spend a great deal of money. In the lead up to our bill reaching \u00a3600 the service could not have been better. All in all, the ambiance is nice, cocktails are delicious, bar snacks are great, however this establishment is seriously let down by the unnecessary and undeserved arrogance of its staff and terrible service.  I feel sick at having spent over \u00a3600 here as there are many better alternatives in London far more deserving of your time and money. I wouldn't visit again and would discourage others from doing so.", "date_of_review": "24 July 2017"}

The waiter were all around cleaning glasses but not taking orders. Took us again a lot of time to order new drinks and some food. I ask for a porn star martini that was tasting nothing but juice and my boyfriend re ordered drink tasted completly different from the first one. The food arrived quickly and was good but no cuttlery or even a napkin. As soon we finish with the food a waiter came to our table and put a reserve sign right in the middle without saying a word, after that came a hostess ( i presume) asking us if we had a reservation for that table, we said no and she said straight that we had to leave the table as all the tables were reserved all day. We told her that we were finishing our drinks and we were leaving soon and in a meanwhile she sat a couple next to us and in our back said to the waiter to tell us that we could stay. The service was really really bad and the drinks didn't worth the price at all. It's not the location that makes a great place.", "date_of_review": "30 May 2017"}

We watched three staff walk past someones coat that had fallen onto the floor..If I was manager of that bar I would have some serious meetings with the staff.. if you see things on the floor- pick them up- little things count for a lot.. get your staff collecting empty glasses and when people look like they are running low on drinks, they should be asking if they would like another .. it doesn't take much!

My friends all arrived before us and were at the table. The birthday girl managed to leave her purse at the previous destination. I was extremely polite and humble with the door lady who was curt and rude beyond belief. It was made very clear that it was non-negotiable to not have the ID so we had to take a cab round trip back to claridges to collect the purse. However 5 minutes later another male member of our party arrived without ID and miraculously managed to get in. Clearly it's not so unnegotiable. 40 minutes later returned with purse. Got upstairs and no staff seemed available so had to wonder around to find our table. Found my friends in the back corner. The table had no lighting, pitch black, and no heating. Considering it's march in the U.K. I expected a heater. Apparently they ran out of gas. The champagne I asked to come out as a surprise was already on the table. My friends brought balloons and poppers to surprise the birthday girl which they obviously used. 10 minutes after our arrival a waitress came over and address the entire group making it very clear she was very annoyed and I can only describe what she did as chastising us and telling us off. It was extremely cringey. I had no idea poppers were not allowed. She told us it was a 5 star hotel - I'm not sure what relevance that had but I would note that most 5 star hotels are a lot more accommodating of their customers and far more polite. We apologised and offered to clear the confetti up and she continued to be rude and stomped off. There was absolutely no music and no vibe also. Drinks expensive and not very nice - cocktails watery. Complete waste of time - jumped up pretentious awful staff. The only waitress that had any manners with the lovely East Asian lady who was a star. The rest need customer service training ASAP. Won't ever return. ", "date_of_review": "13 March 2017"}

We arrived and waited for a member of staff to speak to regarding where we should sit. After a couple of minutes of being passed by we decided to go and seat ourselves. There was one seating area left outside, inside was empty, there were blankets on the floor and thrown over the seats, along with food crumbs and cigarette burns on the cushions. The table was also dirty and sticky. We waited nearly 15 minutes before someone came to take our order. I was just about to go to the bar myself. We ordered a jug of your vodka cocktail (\u00a345) which arrived fairly quickly but was pretty weak. We were also told it contained fresh pear but was in fact apple. Nobody bothered to clean the table. The jug was dumped in front of us for us to pour our own drinks and the waiter disappeared not to be seen again. We ended up having to go to the bar to pay the bill. We were in fact waiting to order another jug of cocktail but after waiting so long decided to move on to another place. When I was given the bill I discovered a 12.5% service charge which amounted to just under \u00a36.00. I paid this because I didn\u2019t want to make a fuss in front of my mum. She took the bill off me to have a look and noticed the service charge and couldn\u2019t believe that I had paid it. She then commented to the member of staff who took our payment that we are more than happy to pay service charge but actually expect to get some service for that charge. She pointed out that the waiter could have at least poured our drinks. To which the member of staff shrugged and said \u2018Sure, I can see your point there.' And then disappeared.

We had dined at the Ivy and been to watch saint Joan on the west end before deciding to end the evening with a night cap. We were greeted by the door staff who reassuringly asked for photo ID as a standard safety precaution when entering the venue. Having also read of the dress code on line I felt assured it would be a suitable venue for my wife's birthday, unfortunately this was not the case. Upon arrival I can only describe the setting as reminiscent of the film Boys in the hood or perhaps a youth club in Peckham. There were two large groups of youths dominating both seating areas on either side of the bar. Their attire included trainers (not allowed under website dress code) and scruffy jeans hanging below the groin area so their underwear was on full view. The other table opposite had similar scruffy attire/sports wear and trainers on. A couple of the group also had black eyes and one a full plaster across the face clearly from fighting. I felt uncomfortable in this environment and the staff appeared to feel the same. The security guards appeared to pander to the two groups and didn't intervene when glasses were smashed and noise levels from the group of about thirty became intolerable. The security staff did however berate individuals for going out onto the balcony to photograph somerset house (stating it's closed), a quite natural occurrence considering this is a rooftop bar to enjoy the view. The bar staff were so busy fussing around these groups that my wife had to go and collect our drinks that had been sat on the bar for several minutes.

We were a little underdressed but the vibe upstairs was awesome. We had a couple of rounds which was quite enough given conversation was a little tricky given the volume of the music. That said the younger ones amongst our party clearly loved the vibe. Had the feel of the place to be and the place to be seen. Cracking views along the Thames too. We managed to grab a table all the same and that did make life a little easier. I'd go again but to be honest it was more my post 21 kids that got the kick.....I was happy with the experience and delighted to be eating somewhere a little quieter.", "date_of_review": "26 December 2016"}

I was wearing dark trainers with black jeans and a casual shirt as we rocked up about 17:00 on a Saturday. The bouncers on the door were polite and I thought we would be turned away when we said we didn't have a reservation. Despite them pointing out that they don't usually allow trainers after 16:00, they let us go on up. The entrance was spectacular, a stunning hostess led us through a slick corridor and sent us up the shiny elevator. As we entered the bar directly from the elevator, I quickly realised why there was no trainers after 4pm. There was still plenty punters relaxing from their daytime visit, but the glam, night time revellers had started to appear, dripping in designer gear as they chilled out in their sold out booths. We grabbed a couple of over priced drinks (\u00a320 for a wine and bottled beer) and headed out to the balcony where all the seats were reserved which flagged up the earlier question about a reservation! The views were beautiful, just like the majority of the guests and staff. We watched the sunset and had a couple more drinks, tipping the staff about 5-10% per round. We were treated just like any other guest as far as I could see, although we did look slightly out of place in our casual daytime gear by the time we left about 19:30. No judgement. The music was class, deep, sexy, groovy, modern house music which perfectly set the mood for everyone starting off their Saturday night. Will definitely be back, with a fuller wallet and with better shoes on ", "date_of_review": "27 November 2016"}

After being made to queue for 15 minutes (only to discover a half empty bar) we made our way up the lift. Went to the bar and ordered 3 P Star Martinis and a Mojito - the barman made the mojito placed it on the bar in front of me then proceeded to mix up the martinis, before he was about to pour them into tumblers i said, sorry, can i please have them in the martini glass, he said i dont have any left - i saw some down the bar a bit so i said what about them? he took them, made the drinks in the correct glasses, only then to start an argument with one of the other barman who said he had reserved the glasses for his own cocktails! internal bar argument over glasses - this made barman number 2 angry as he in turn had to serve his drinks in tumblers (\u00a313 a go) to the point where he decided to take it out on me. I paid for the drunks, took the 3 martinis to the table where my customers were and came back for my mojito. No less than a metre from where the bar was only to find out that in a harry houdini like moment, my mojito had disappeared from the bar!!! When i asked the barman what had happened to my drink (barman number 1) he said when the drinks are paid for they become your responsibility! to which i laughed, ok, get me the manager please. Barman number 2 had clearly swiped it out of his rage for having to go and wash up a few more glasses but however without proof i calmly and embarrassingly in front of my clients spoke to the manager - i am not sure what internal grievances are going on between these two but i have just been the victim of a ridiculous situation ending in my mojito being swiped before id taken a sip! He immediately instructed a girl called Daisy to make two mojitos - which she did, and then in an almost final act of bartender defiance, she tried to tell me that her manager had only asked her to make one for me so gave me one, whilst the other one sat on the bar!!!!! literally 2 seconds later, the manager himself appeared with the second mojito and apologised to me. I then saw him go inside and blast the bar staff verbally. Heres a tip for the bar tenders at Radio - if you dont like your job, go and get another one you bunch of miserable petty fools - well done to the manager, you attempted to handle the situation as it should been handled only to be thwarted by your staff.  I will not return to this place ever again, neither will my customers, nor my circle of friends. Customer experience is king to return custom. Poor effort.", "date_of_review": "12 December 2016"}

The restaurant has amazing views looking over London you can see such buildings as the Gherkin and the Shard. The bar is impressive round and bright and they have a great outside area as well to have a drink which has comfy sofas to lounge on with heaters and blankets for the colder days/nights which is very cosy.  However as for the restaurant side of things I would not recommend Radio Rooftop as the food was appalling. When we first arrived our table was not even set out so they had to move tables together and dress the table which was odd considering we had a booking. One of the tables also kept on sinking as had a mechanism in where you could make it higher or lower. When it came to the food I ordered the seafood linguine and literally waited for it for approx 30 minutes. The portion was small and the pasta and seafood was luke warm, tasteless and the chillies even had no taste to them no heat nothing and the pasta was sticking together practically. One persons seafood linguini did not have any clam meat just empty shells. However everyone else had ordered a burger and I must admit that did look good big, chunky and juice with a brioche bun but the chips were the long frozen type fries not hand cut chips which was disappointing to see but they tasted nice. For dessert we ordered the apple crumble again a very long wait until it came to the table and when it did it looked more like soup with apple floating around in it with a scattering of crumble. Could not eat it as was soup and the small amount I did slurp up like soup tasted of burnt caramel. The waiter apologised and then came back and told us it was because there was an accident in the kitchen what the accident was I don\u2019t know but worrying to think why our crumble looked like the way it did. We sent all crumbles back. Even though the staff was apologetic and nice I would not go back for the food at all as below standards and the food took way too long to come out and when it did was luke warm anyway.  I am rating this place 2 out of 5 as went along for the food in the restaurant.  However even though I would not go back for there for food I would possibly go back for a drink or two to experience the amazing views on offer.", "date_of_review": "9 December 2016"}

We were moved to another area of the rooftop at around 10 because of noise pollution for surrounding residents. The staff were attentive and the champagne flowed.

Such a pity because the place is nicely located and has wonderful views but it is always a struggle to find a place, waiters are more anxious at your shoes than at delivering a good service! they kept pressing us for more orders while we were waiting for more firends to come (and we were already with a drink in our hands!!), they brought us the wrong order, broke a glass and kept telling us the table was reserved and we had to vacate it..which they stopped saying the moment we placed a large order!

We complained to a waiter who was very rude telling us that if we had sat in a different area of the restaurant we would have been served quicker (absolutely ridiculous)!! The manager then intervened and reduced the bill by \u00a3100 including the service charge , at that point the other drinks we had ordered with deserts turned up, needless to say we left frustrated and upset that we had been treated this way in what was supposed to be a surprise birthday celebration, we will not be returning.

The cocktails were lovely and the sandwiches novel and tasty - I particularly liked the watermelon, feta and olive. The fruit salad came with earl grey mouse and felt more like desert than a palate cleanser! The waiters kept our teapots full and hot throughout. The variety of cakes and pastries was fantastic. As it was a birthday lunch Richard bought over doughnuts with a candle which was a lovely touch! We were so full we had to bring the doughnuts home with us.

When I have been to other afternoon teas you can fill a little hungry afterwards but this one was huge! So much food, and it was all very tasty. As well as getting lots of cakes you also get scones with cream and jam - best scones I've had for ages. And just when you think you are finished a white chocolate ice cream with frozen strawberries. To make it more worth your while you should have the Afternoon Tea with the cocktail/mocktail. Cocktails were lovely and so refreshing especially in the sunshine. It does get realty hot up there in the sun and I recall at some point the roof closed to shut out the sun (which was a blessing) Staff were very attentive and helped us along the way with the food (we had two vegetarians in the group) Would highly recommend the afternoon tea.

It also made for super attentive staff who were polite and helpful, substituting an item off the menu with no problem (due to dietary requirements). I had a Bloody Mary which hit the spot for a morning-after tipple - they make it to your liking - and my friends shared a bottle of wine. The brunch was delicious, lots of good options to choose from, and well-presented decent portions. The black pudding hash was very popular among our group, as was the croissant with avocado. I had the shakshuka which was different to any other that I've had, quite rich and saucy, but very tasty - I was not disappointed, however the egg which is supposed to be poached in the vegetables was actually just a fried egg laid on top.  Situated on the top of the ME hotel, you are greeted by the doorman who will direct you to the lifts/ reception just past the lobby with its striking chrome tube installations separating off the lounge area. We had no trouble with the dress code despite two of us wearing converse-like gym-shoes (on the whole we were quite casual with shorts, sandals and tees), however I can see that they might be a lot stricter on this rule should they wish. At the top you have great views over London, to the East you can see the Gherkin, Cheesegrater, Walkie Talkie etc and the Shard, and to the West you can see Big Ben. The rooftop has high quality furnishings, including sofas and a cabana to relax in. I often find these types of fancy places let themselves down by being too stuffy or clinical, rude service or poor portions or whatever, however I thought the pricing was very reasonable for the superb quality delivered here, and on this occasion could not fault the service.

I have to agree with other reviewers when they call it pretentious.

There is not a huge selection of teas but there were black, green and herbal ones so there was something for everyone. We were told this was a new venture for them and they were certainly trying there hardest to make it pleasant for us. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday and she was given a plate of doughnuts with chocolate dip with a candle on top. There was a slight hiccup with the service and we had to wait quite a while after the sandwiches but we received full apologies and the rest of the meal was served very smoothly. Another slight hiccup with the bill which was put right immediately to everyone's satisfaction.

On Saturday 1st August we were joined by some clients from overseas whom we were entertaining.  On this occasion, we were staying at the Savoy, but given it was a nice evening we were told by our concierge that we would be looked after at Radio Rooftop Bar. We went to the lifts which we had previously used when stayed at Melia to enter Radio. Our guests entered the lift a few paces ahead of us with some other guests. As the doors were about to close, the security personnel at the desk made my husband and I leave the lift with our guests and started to interrogate us. Our guests went on ahead as the lift doors had closed. As you can imagine, being separated in this way was highly embarrassing to us. The young lady at the desk with a clipboard was demanding our room number which we gave to her, she spoke to a colleague over the radio who said that we were not staying at that particular room number. We told her that we were staying at the Savoy, and that they had advised us to visit with our clients and that she had already sent them up in the lift, however we were then rudely ushered out of the lift lobby and told to queue up outside. We were totally unaware there was another entrance and feel that we were totally disrespected by the staff on the ground floor entrance to Radio. Our client then spoke to a member of management in Radio, who then said we could enter. Our client even came down to the street entrance of Radio to see what was happening. He spoke to Francesca who was very dismissive toward our client and us. She then spoke to the internal lift entrance who had told her there hand been an altercation and we were refused entry altogether with our clients still inside.  As far as we were concerned, there was no altercation, not even a raised voice! Just a simple misunderstanding which left my husband and I totally humiliated in front of our clients.  We were expecting to spend in the region of at least \u00a31000 in the bar on celebratory drinks and food which Radio Rooftop Bar has sadly missed out on due to the staff being incredibly rude, disrespectful and not managing the situation very well at all.

You will book your afternoon tea for a 2 hour sitting....but after 3 hours you probably won't have even been served your tea! I am not sure why they service is so slow as there appears to be dedicated staff to serve afternoon tea and another bunch to serve lunch. The staff appear nice but you can tell some are biting their tongue! The china was broken or dirty and when you ask for a new cup because your one is cracked and has tea stains or left over scone crumbs stuck to the side from a previous sitting... you get questioned by the waiter as to why you need a new cup?!  The food was nice but not amazing! The views aren't that great especially if you are sitting in the middle! You are sitting so close to other tables that you can hear everyone complaining!

Otherwise, its bery likely the lovely young lady downstairs will be politely turning you away.  - the entrance is not the main hotel entrance.

No apology was offered even though it was obvious that my friend had pretty much finished her meal. We ordered champagne and one of the glasses it came in was chipped so this had to be replaced.  The view of London from the bar is stunning and if this is your priority then go for it but maybe just drinks! If you want a lovely lunch then there are so many better choices in London. In my opinion it was overpriced and poor quality. 15% service was automatically added to the bill which considering we had to send a drink and a main course back seemed very presumptuous.

But when we ordered some almonds and had to remind them of the order twice, I went to the (who appeared to be) a manager and said that the service is terrible. He didn't even apologise, just said he'd check on our snacks. There are some pointless suited personnel and enough waiters, they don't exactly break into sweat, but what they are therefore, I could not tell. There is actually someone who goes in the elevator with you to press the button! For crying out loud! Their service must be the reason for the \u00a3100 minimum spent rule. Otherwise customers would just leave. Also, the staff are not motivated to make any effort if everyone spends a minimum of \u00a3100 even before receiving any service. Needless to say I would not recommend. There are better rooftops/places with some incredible views over London offering a better service.", "date_of_review": "15 July 2016"}

However, I found that we enjoyed the cocktails, food and view so much we did not notice that we had comfortably crossed that spend threshold until we settled the tab (ouch!). So, yes, it seemed expensive from street level, but once we were on the roof with drink in hand, food on the table and a lovely sunset unfolding before us, we did not mind the price so much.  The signature cocktails were tasty, albeit a little limited in range, but it was the tapas that impressed us most; it really was delicious. The waiting staff were also very attentive, so we were happy ordering bit by bit, rather than feeling obliged to order in bulk when we had their attention.  The terrace has a retractable roof and heat lamps to make it an all-weather venue, but it's nevertheless worth checking a weather forecast before making a booking. A drawback of being outside is that smokers from the bar will inevitably congregate near your table (I didn't spot a specific smoking zone), but I guess the same can be said for most outdoor eating/drinking venues. A tip: see if you can get a table on the south side overlooking the river. The view from the northwest side is an enjoyable mash up of rooftops and cranes, which look great silhouetted against the setting sun, but I'd have loved to have watched the river traffic while sipping my Thames River Iced Me.", "date_of_review": "14 July 2016"}

How does staying for one drink, turn into watching the sunset go down and an expensive bar tab? Ooops. Selection of drinks was larger than most rooftop bars in London. Drinks varied in prices but we're on average \u00a313-15 each.  We had tapas on our table, roughly \u00a312 a plate. Very yummy however the bruschetta bread was a little 'soggy'. Would recommend to anyone on a summers day or evening!!  Will be returning soon! ", "date_of_review": "13 July 2016"}

It was busy when we went and all the patio heaters were taken so we stayed inside. You can drink at the centered bar or be guided to a seat (reservations advisable at busy times) as we were. Service is a little slow, if glamorously served, and we waited too long for very expensive (\u00a3150 per bottle) pink champagne. It was not easy getting a second bottle as it was now getting busy and very loud inside. I'm sure its great for the youngsters in town but for us more mature revelers it became a little hectic and we were glad to get out and into our restaurant. I would go back there in the summer and sit outside on a less busy day and I would be confident of a stunning setting and less hectic time....for me, this would be when this place would come in to its own ", "date_of_review": "12 July 2016"}

I'll start with the planning, I was in talks with the events organiser Miriam, who was superb, so friendly and very helpful. Once I had decided what I wanted to do and where, I emailed Miriam and started the conversation, this was a good 6 weeks or so before the proposal. Miriam was quick to reply and usually with good ideas and helpful tips, we eventually managed to book me a cabana on the balcony for an hour or so. We set it up so that my fianc\u00e9e was meeting a client and she was ushered up to the rooftop bar where I had laid out rose petals leading her to me. The bar also played isn't she lovely as she walked in, which was another request they were happy to go along with. They also helped out with hiding the parents, we had a few chats about this and in the end they were hidden at the other side of the on the balcony. Honestly, the staff in the bar were so helpful and even excited for me, the atmosphere was great and we had our own waitress. The proposal went perfectly, she said 'yes' which was lucky since our parents were present and hiding round the corner. Immediately after the proposal (as requested) the parents were ushered out to our cabana accompanied by a large bottle of champagne to share. We then enjoyed the moment and the cabana for the next hour before heading downstairs to STK for dinner. Overall, the staff and Miriam were helpful and very friendly which helped everything run as smooth as it could. The manager even came out to greet me and wish me luck at one point which was a nice touch. The bar itself is stunning, very well laid out and the balcony has a very cool vibe along with amazing views. Highly recommended.", "date_of_review": "8 July 2016"}

While we were ordering drinks plus food, half way while we were stating what we would like, she stopped and said \" once you really know what you want, I'll come back as I'm busy!!\" We were all,shocked as we were ordering and never have we ever experience a waitress stopping our order request in mid sentence, just didn't make sense at all! That immediately spoilt our evening. The client was over London for a few days and travelled over from South Africa, he was so shocked at the service. I've never been so embarrassed and would never ever suggest this place ever again.

I would have thought the 'rooftop' terrace was a given when booking and guaranteeing to spend a lot of money, I actually laughed when he showed us the table because I thought he was joking.

I wish we'd just received a bit of honesty when we got there and been told that it was going to be very unlikely that we'd receive the requested table. We would have been fine then. We would have kicked back and settled at the table we had. Instead, I had a situation where my clients were eager to get outside enjoy the sunshine. Everything else was fine.

Today we were faced with a particularly rude and very unhelpful hostess at the bottom of the lift. The hostess said we could only go up with a reservation, I asked if she could kindly call up and make me a reservation for us....she said that was not possible even though she had a radio and was chatting to the staff in the bar over said radio. I then called the reservation line to be told that there was indeed room in the bar but she was unable to make a reservation for 45 minutes. Frustrating having wasted a cab fare to get there. Seems daft that the bar has capacity but can't take bookings, seems daft the hostess can't go up or call up to make a reservation and seems daft to turn away good business.

Comfortable seating throughout and heaters outside. However the service was so slow despite the bar being about 1/3 capacity. And not only that, you get charged 15% (yes fifteen per cent) for service (more than most restaurants in London) to wait about 10 minutes for a guy to pull a few bottles of beer out of the fridge and take the cap off. This brought the cost of one bottle to \u00a37.10, which is pretty lumpy to say the least.

Some, good or not so good, some pricey but worth it but Radio Rooftop has been the worst - pricey and bad costumer service. Arrived at the club 920pm, i could not shake the feeling that we were being kept an eye on. Very uncomfortable (mostly asian in our party) time.  Anyway, at 10 or 1030pm, half of the rooftop seating had been shut and everyone has been squeezed in to a little space (smokers, drunk people) you can imagine how uncomfortable that was. No explanation given, people were told to empty their seats and move to the other side. So the rooftop experience is non existent. Im 29 years old and have partied in ibiza, amsterdam, spain, portugal, bangkok, singapore, france, and more. I have never seen such appalling attitude from bouncers. They're rude, unwilling to take any explanation, when they have their eye on you, you're out, all of you. Here's what happened. 1130 pm, admittedly, we have one friend who has probably had a bit to much to drink. 1145 pm, the waitress asked us to pay for the table and so we did, this 'drunk friend' of mine, got his card out and paid straight out \u00a3350, done. Then he said let's go for a cigarette, halfway to the doors, we were stopped by two men and hurried us to the lift. Both said you need to go. I said, chill, we're going. While waiting for the lift to come up, I realised that i have my other friend's mobile in my pocket. Asked the bouncer if i can just return this quickly, he rudely said, \"no! all your friends will be joining you in a minute now'.  I still followed as im never a trouble maker. Im a deputy manager who works in london and I manage 55 staff under me, I know how costumer service works and believe you me, if you want to have a good time, this isnt the place. Money is not the issue here, but what's wrong is if you all get treated badly because you look different from the crowd. The manager couldnt be any more helpful, they looked at all of us then shouted, \"Out!' To cut this story, we arrived at the venue 920pm, paid the bill 1145pm (around \u00a31200), got kicked out straight after that (all of us 11: 5 british, 6 asians). We occupied 3 tables because there was plenty of us, and as we went out the main entrance, there was a queue of at least 10 people waiting to get in. I just thought, these bloody people can sell those 3 tables again for 1k each because we've all been chucked out.  This place has poor ratings for a reason.

I loved it, everything is lovely, the nibbles are delicious and the views are outstanding. However it is a very busy busy bar, and it is best to book a table in advance so you can get table service. I would also advise that you should not come here if you are impatient in nature because the speed at which the service is delivered is not as fast paced as some people would like it too be.

After speaking to him for a while he quickly realised I was not drunk in the slightest and apologised however no member of management showed up to offer a proper apology or anything to make up for their clear mistake, all I heard was that some lady who was part of the bar management happened to be in the toilets with us and for some reason took a dislike to me and clearly made up a lie - which is just beyond unprofessional.  I can honestly say I have never been treated with such disrespect and maliciousness in a bar/restaurant in my life and completely regret spending my birthday in such an unprofessional environment.

I've also ate many times from their kitchen. The food was perfectly presented, very hygienic and delicious.  And for a five star establishment there are some very reasonable priced food and drink alternatives, so it does not have to be an over expensive visit for you.

He said we could cancel the booking it was fine. It wasn't his fault there was a maintenance issue despite it being a clip board issue.  When they finally got out they were offered water, that's it. We ordered food it took ages, a bottle of wine took 40 minutes. The table next to me had to go and get their own water, everyone was moaning. It's such a waste.

The omelette was nice but not amazing, slightly dry...would've been nice with a small salad on the side - I would try something else next time  The Bloody Mary's were good, although the service was rather slow and we had to grab a waiters attention each time we wanted a drink, plus my friend had a long wait for service at the bar That said, we were not overly bothered as it was a chilled Sunday and were fine to have a more relaxed dining experience. However 2 or 3 other diners we spoke to were not happy about the wait All in all we did have a lovely day and were there for hours drinking and nibbling on a cured meats platter we ordered later, which was really tasty. The staff were great, we didn't make the most of the view, but it was lovely and would definitely go back. Just go and relax if dining on a Sunday.....", "date_of_review": "4 April 2016"}

Staff on ground level were wonderful, arriving at the 10th floor bar the female staff were so arrogant and rude. Cocktail was gorgeous but decided to leave after just one due to being made to feel so uncomfortable by the waitresses. Everything felt so rushed, not relaxing and very disappointed by the experience. Would love to return but the female staff need to improve their customer skills first. The gents were far more chilled and made everyone feel welcome. There was a Brunch menu served until 3pm, would be nice to have a better choice for lunchtime though.

The atmosphere was good until it came to leaving. Leaving shouldn't be a problem as there is a strict maximum capacity in place so they, in theory should be glad of people leaving so they can welcome more customers. Unfortunately for them their lift broke, which meant we were put in the service lift with no apology. I know this was not their fault but being shut in a lift with no direction on which floor to get out or anything was a bit daunting. We stopped in the basement at first and were told that we should not be there. Then when we finally made our way to the back door exit, the doorman a) shut the door in my face and b) was incredibly rude to me and my partner after we raised out concerns about the lift.

Radio Rooftop falls into this category fairly and squarely. The first thing you'll notice is how brief the drinks and the food menus are. And if you have any expectation based on what is being said in their online versions, forget it immediately: the actual menu is quite different from the online one and very much shorter. The cheapest bottle of (mediocre) French wine will be \u00a333, the cheapest champagne will be almost \u00a380, cocktails are about \u00a315, bottled water is about \u00a35. This is not outrageous by central London standards but is still on an expensive side. What is disappointing is the price/quality combination rather than the price itself: one expects better wines, better executed cocktails, and better choice for this money. Food is served as small bites, nibbles, and mini-tapas at about \u00a35-6 per portion. Two tiny skewers of beef or chicken, two miniburgers, about 30g of jamon - these are the portion sizes. Of course, it is a bar rather than anything else, and one shouldn't expect a full-blown food feast. Having said that, both the quality of the food itself and the prices are wrong: fares are disappointingly \"fast-foodish\" by looks and flavour and can't justify the prices. Service is very much hit and miss there. You'll have lengthy periods of waiting between the orders (which is even more disappointing as the \"slots\" for the customers are 2h only and you should expect to be kicked out of this place as soon as your time comes up). Waiting culture is very uneven. Some waiters are efficient, quick, and polite. Others are brusque and unwelcoming. Don't be surprised to get a drink that you've never ordered by be banged in front of you by a rishing waitress without a word. However quick you are, she is quicker and will disappear in a flash, so you'll never have a chance to ask what was it all about. The obvious attraction of the place is its location - on top of a dull and unimaginative hotel building that stands on a site of a long-defunct Gaiety Theatre. The views are very nice though you have to remember that it is 10th floor only, so don't expect any bird's-eye views of the capital from there. Obviously, having an outside terrace adds to the customers' experience on so many levels, and is the best feature of this place. Yes, you can smoke there. Yes, it is heated. No, the smokers won't disturb you there as there are designated smoking areas with significant chunks of the terrace being smoke-free. The crowd is very mixed there. Being just on the border of the Theatreland and the City, the place attracts respective crowds with the age mix being of wide spectrum. A word of warning though. The place isn't exactly family-friendly. Moreover, it will suit a single drinker or a male drinking company better than a happy couple. Overall, I haven't regretted spending my designated 2h there (you have to remember that the time-slots are being respected very strictly there, so do expect to be asked to leave at the end of your designated time) but I won't be rushing back anytime soon.  Another word of advice - be very careful while walking there and look under your feet. The tiles by the main bar are very slippery, and if there is a spillage by a punter or a waiter, accidents do and will happen. While we were there, one of the ladies had a nasty fall on the tiles and injured herself rather badly. 5 out of 10.", "date_of_review": "11 March 2016"}

The bartenders here are just rude. They're young, immature boys. Unfortunately if you're not flaunting money or yourself over the bar - you don't get served. My friend and I stood and waited at the bar for 20 mins ... We were overlooked several times by 3 bar boys. They seemed to be more interested in the girls that were flirting with them than serving customers with respect. We finally waved a hand asking for some service in which we were dissed again and made to wait another 5 mins - with a wave of his hand in our face as if to say\"I'm ready now\" !! Shocking service. For the amount of money we paid to stay in this hotel you would expect proper service through out but The Radio Rooftop bar sadly is a let down. Very pretentious and not a bar I would recommend. Being American there is no way this would be acceptable in such an establishment. The views during the day are amazing. That's the only thing this bar has going for it.

Next time I'll wear a short skirt as that seems to be what will allow you in! Appalling place in every way!  Totally understand you can turn away who ever you wish it's your place.

The Rib-eye steak was quite simply one of the best I have had in London. The wagyu burgers to start were also very good and the wine was delicious. Our waiter was friendly and observant and the meal in general was a good experience despite the 'style' of the place not being to my taste. If only the same could be said for the roof top bar.... We visited this for a pre dinner drink for my sisters 30th birthday and there was 12 in our party ranging from my siblings to my parents and in laws. The place reminded me of being at a beach club in Ibiza and not one of the good ones. More like Essex's version of Nikki beach - maybe cool for an 18 year old straight out of school but in the real world the whole place stunk of pretentiousness. My opinion was confirmed after my experience with the bar man. Due to the size of our party I ordered 6 gin and tonics to which he prepared fine. As I ordered the remaining drinks I was greeted with a grunt and a sigh and asked to order all at once in future. Granted he may have a point but I thought it was being helpful ordering 6 at a time and the manner in which he spoke and sighed was extremely rude and unprofessional. None the less I got on with it and ordered the remaining drinks.... he got the order wrong putting tonic in a vodka and soda drink. I felt a slight feeling of satisfaction considering he initially wanted the whole 12 drinks ordered at once and the recipient of the drink wasn't bothered so again we just got on with it. As he was finishing up the final drinks my 70 year old father who had to wait for another lift as we couldn't all fit in one approached me for his drink.... a gin n tonic, Probably irritating for 'Mr 12 drinks at a time' but in the grand scheme of things hardly a huge problem and I certainly wasn't going to leave my father without a drink. What I witnessed next was truly shocking even by London standards! As I apologised (out of courtesy rather than believing an apology was needed), and ordered the final gin and tonic he turned away and said 'no I'm closing the bill' Initially I thought he was joking and laughed along.... he wasn't. I politely explained the situation (even though I shouldn't need to) and he responded with the same answer saying he had to move on. Of course I immediately asked for the manager. The manager arrived and was pleasant. He listened to my complaint, apologised and personally went and poured the drink himself. The icing on the cake which for me summed up this place was when the manager said he would do something with the bill. A nice gesture I thought to maybe give the extra drink for free or perhaps a discount on the \u00a3140 round.... He informed me that to apologise for the service we had received he had taken off the service charge! both myself and 2 other guests listening in burst out laughing in unison. The fact service charge is added to a round of drinks served in a plastic cup with tonic dispensed out of a gun by a stuck up barman is bad enough but the fact there is a compulsory service charge on top of an \u00a311 drink is saddening. For reference the excuse the manager gave was the bar was extremely busy. 1) I was not some drunk in a wetherspoons faffing around with his order. 2) there were a handful of people waiting to be served, maybe 5 at most. If this is 'busy' then maybe a reality check is needed or more staff need to be employed. I run a bar company supplying outdoor bars to sporting events and festivals. The majority of staff are part time students and If I had witnessed any one of them behaving like this to a customer I would be horrified. These guys have to deal with serving 50,000 pints in one afternoon of trading... now that is busy, but they do it with a smile on their face which we absolutely insist on. Unfortunately, more and more barmen, especially in 'top' London cocktail bars seem to think they are the most important person in the place. All too often they forget why they are there which is to enhance a customers experience. Unfortunately a self inflated ego was quite apparent and it is such a shame because the view from the balcony is quite simply phenomenal.", "date_of_review": "17 February 2016"}

We find a stunning area outside with a view to die for only to be ignored for over 25 minutes.

But she was so upset that we had come so far that she wanted us to just wait a couple more minutes. As the rude waiter goes back over with there cocktails luckily the customers point over to us to tell him they're still waiting to be served. We had no apology just a \"what would you like to order\" as we send off our order it takes another 15 minutes for a different waiter to approach us to see if everything's okay on an empty table with nothing in our hands. Absolute joke. He checks on our cocktails and to find out if they've even been made. I can not express enough how bad the service is and the cheek to add on a service charge is just diabolical. \u00a316 each for a cocktail. I will never come back here again.

Drinks were overpriced and weren't great! It was a complete let down by all staff, poor service and no attention to guests! Definitely, they were not short of staff, many but not caring.  1. Reservation made, on the day we called to delay the reservation by 30mins. Lady on the phone said she would check as she believes it's fully booked and will try keep a table inside and not out on the terrace.  2. When arrived the place had plenty of vacant tables. Guy took our name and even asked if preferred inside or outside seating! (Contradicts to the phone call? Doesn't sound like table was assigned nor fully booked). We decided outside in the end but then the guy just pointed us out to the terrace rather than taking us to the table! (Where's the service????) 3. Walked to the terrace, no staff around but there were several couples having lunch and drinks. We sat down at a table with dirty glasses, waiter removed it without acknowledging us such as welcome, show the menus etc! Sat for 10-15mins still no one came to table (plenty of staff wandering around inside!). We walked up to the bar to order drinks, still had to wait for 5-10mins (1 bar man) then finally another bar man came asked if we been served! FYI no other guests around the bar waiting! When tried to order, the bar man told us to take a seat and someone would come over, we explained that we have been waited but no one cared.  4. Whilst waited for the drinks, we called waiter to ask about the menu and if someone could wipe the table as it was dirty and complaint to him that we weren't happy with the service as no one had acknowledged us and we even had to order drinks from the bar ourselves when it's a table service. Clearly the waiter did not care and not have passed any words to his supervisor/manager not even bothered to wipe the table or came back to take our food order! 5. When drinks came, wrong order came to our table where it supposed to be on another table. No apologies given and instead the waiter thought it was funny and laughed with his colleague so unprofessional.  One of the Spanish waitress was good at least more responsible with her job.

It's is rather predictably expensive being a hotel + when the weather is fine the management seem to try and create a buzz by making people queue and generally asking a lot of nonsense questions and flicking through their clipboards of paper before letting you in. Popularity over the summer months meant I was turned away on one occasion, sighting some excuse they were full and only accepting hotel residents - this also happened to my boss, who actually checked-in to the hotel to ensure our first time London visitors weren't disappointed. Not really what I expect given I've probably spent in the region of \u00a31-2k there this year on client entertainment alone. To guarantee fuss free admission, get there just before 5pm and access via the hotel rather than the street. My advise to management would be, try and look after your neighbouring clientele. Nobody wants to be turned away in front of clients!

However ... The doorman was rude The lady operating the elevator was rude The hostess was rude The waitresses were especially rude To be fair, the barman who served us when we first arrived was friendly while making our drinks, but the the core customer service reeks of pretentiousness from the moment you arrive and simply wasn't for us.  This is a place people will go simply \"to be seen\" and if you're not obviously going to be spending a fortune then you can be made to feel uncomfortable, as we were. There were plenty of empty tables when we arrived at 4pm on a Sunday afternoon, inside and outside, but we were not allowed to sit down at any of them as they were booked. None of these empty tables were filled in the 45 minutes we were there. You'll pay \u00a38 for a bottle of beer and \u00a314 for a cocktail ... and of course, you're paying for the view.

We could clearly see other customers with bowls of chips etc. We drank our over-priced wine and left.

We reserved an outdoor table for a minimum spend of \u00a3150.  Upon arrival, I felt the venue was very stylish, atmosphere seemed great and good music. We waited briefly until our table was confirmed, then shown by a polite waitress.  The table was terrible, a high table squeezed in a corner under a heat lamp, we had a rubbish view, immediately felt uncomfortable and regretting the reservation. It felt like a pub smoking area, no music, no lounging tables or chairs as advertised.  The service was absolutely shocking, the general waitressing was polite, but very slow and unattentive. I complained to the original hostess with ombr\u00e9 hair and requested another table to be told the venue was full, inside and out, the balcony with good views closes at 10pm. There was nothing they could or would do. The heat lamps couldn't be turned off either. No empathy, no apology, absolutely no desire to attend to our needs or expectations. They already had my credit card at this point, a very sly trick, they took that before they'd shown us the rubbish table.  There was 2 lower tables right beside us without reservation signs. These were quickly occupied by random smokers. So I tried to stay optimistic and make most of my one night in the city, decided the cocktails and service could improve with the night. It didn't. When the other balcony closed it meant our table area was crammed with people smoking. I booked the outdoor table for views! There was two couples stood using our table, which I had paid for. As far as I'm concerned tables should come with table service. Meaning that people cannot walk in from the street and join booked tables.  I absolutely hated my night, spent my minimum spend because I had to then went straight home to my hotel after a terrible evening. I didn't enjoy a second of it, the cocktails were average. I had to take my drink to the bar twice because it was made incorrectly, the waitresses were too slow and infrequent to grab their attention. Then to top it off had to pay a service charge for the worst service I have ever endured in London, actually at any high end bar. After working as hostess myself for many years before my profession now I was absolutely appalled at this venue. I have realistic expectations and a gesture of good will or apology should be instilled on the staff here. The staff get their service charge so don't need to earn it themselves. Don't waste your time paying or booking anything. Maybes pop in for a drink to enjoy the atmosphere, at a push. I didn't even order any food because I was so furious. I spent my tab allowance and left. ", "date_of_review": "11 October 2015"}

Once it arrived the cocktail was indeed delicious but was served in a plastic tumbler NOT what one expects for an establishment that portrays itself otherwise and amazingly has extortionate minimum spend limits later in the day.

The waitress was wonderful, I have to say that the snacks was very expensive, we ordered a couple of portions of Chips/potato bravas style, when they arrived I asked where the other portion was and they said that the 2 stacks of chips was 2 portions.

He arrived at 5:30 got drinks in for us both and awaited my arrival. My train was delayed so I got there at 6:30 to see a queue outside.  I went up the door and explained I was meeting a friend who was already up there with a beer on the bar and they asked me his name. I didn't quite understand why they needed his name but gave it anyway and was told it wasn't on their list so I couldn't come in. The lady was very polite about it but more or less dismissed me and moved onto the next person. I remained at the door communicating with my friend (by the way we're both 40 something company directors) whilst speaking to the lady on the door but they stood resolute, I could not come in. Meanwhile someone else turned up with the same problem, friend upstairs at the bar, same response, names not on the list you're not coming in. He said he'd been told it was half empty to which a gentleman on the door replied \"rooftop bar on the hottest day of the year empty? Yeh right!\". My friend confirmed it was half empty which I conveyed to the door staff but the gentleman explained it was table bookings only now because of \"capacity issues\" so if my friend didn't have a table I couldn't come in. Meanwhile my friend got speaking to someone at a table who then offered to let us join them so I could get in, I gave his name to the lady on the door who checked her list half-heartedly (by now it was obvious I wasn't getting in whatever I said) and unsurprisingly she denied that name was on the list (but wouldn't let me see the list to verify it). After 30 minutes of failed negotiation, my friend left my beer at the bar, came down and we went to Henry's Bar in Covent Garden which had a live Jazz Band playing, quick service and friendly staff. I haven't received this kind of treatment at a door since I was 18 trying to get into an Essex nightclub. I've been to lots of rooftop bars in my life, I couldn't care less about places like this, but just purely based on their approach on the door I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Life is too short and London is full of nice places to drink....give this one a very wide birth if you don't want your evening ruined by uncaring, aloof jobsworths on the door.", "date_of_review": "2 July 2015"}

It was quite a shock to move from the elegance & friendliness of Spring to the glade-plug-in scented frosty attitude of the reception desk at \"ME\" hotel. I was directed back outside to the non-residents entrance to Radio Rooftop and told by the doorman \"no guest list or reservation, no admittance\", as he turned away, clutching his list. We were the only people trying to get in (all 2 of us, by the way). I always say you can get a pretty good sense of the sort of crowd a place attracts by the manner of the door staff.

A nice touch was as I was ordering a couple of desserts a neighbouring table was having a birthday cake delivered and I joked about having candles on the doughnuts, which were to die for. When they arrived there was a candle on the doughnut and a happy birthday in chocolate, a very nice touch. The bathrooms are dark but it goes along with the clubby feel and I liked it. Not sure how I'd fare if Ineeded my makeup touched up. It was a bit of a drizzly day but as soon as some drizzle started the awning was closed then opened up as the rain stopped. So now worries about visiting on a rainy day. The music was good took me though if you wanted to have an easy conversation outside is better.. The outside terrace closes down on one side at 10pm so as not to disturb hotel guests. The remaining terrace was packed as we were leaving at 10pm, great party atmosphere . You can smoke on the open terraces which did not bothere me as I'm a sneaky smoker but my fiancee noticed the smoke though it was not intrusive enough to spoil her evening.

This can be a lottery and if you are refused entry clearly your review or opinion is going to be negative.  The selection process is deemed to be on appearance. So the greeter is looking to see if you sober (ish) and look like someone made of good stuff. Quite how that works seems hit and miss and our friends will attest to. However being of more senior years I have never been refused entry. I like this place. So when you enter you walk to another greeter who calls a lift that ONLY goes to the roof. As the door opens you get bombarded with sunlight, loud music and beautiful (well some) people partying. Its vibrant. Very vibrant. If you want a table or booth or sofa area you best book as getting one ad-hoc is unlikey. All cocktails and Vodka/GIn mixers etc are \u00a314 as at May 2015. They make a good cocktail. You can run a tab and the waitress service if you stand or sit is good so you don't wait long. You can if you choose order form the bar.  Food, though I've never eaten looks very good. There are views but in reality you need a table at the edge and if your just standing you can t see too much.  But it has a buzz and these boutique bars are becoming more in number.

Who in their right mind books a table at a rooftop bar near the entrance & toilet doors a MONTH in advance. There was NO reserved sign when the table was allocated to us, so that made no sense. The host kept walking past us as if to try and intimidate us but we refused to leave as our food had arrived and we were now very frustrated and hungry. We got no apology from anyone from Management, they walked past us several times as if nothing had happened. If you have the money to spend I'd suggest staying away from this place.

Unless you are under 25, don't even bother trying to go there on an evening... it is extremely busy, and full of young wannabe wags and failed footballer types. I took my daughter there on a very sunny Monday lunchtime, on my Birthday day out. It was very quiet, and a totally different proposition.... i.e. far from the madding crowds, it is a very pleasant experience. The staff are relaxed, smiling and helpful. The view from the roof is great, and there are some really nice little covered 'alcove' type seating areas. There also seems to be a little glass conservatory, which I assume you can book for private functions ?  Cocktails are nice, but obviously at a premium, and you can have some food up there too. Probably a nice place to impress a date: During the day if you are older, like me ; During the evening if you are a young pretender ! Tip - I got lucky, as it was a Monday and early afternoon. I would strongly urge you to book if you want to go here. There is also a separate entrance door to the ground floor lift lobby, on the side opposite to the Waldorf Hotel... saves you having to go through the main Hotel entrance.", "date_of_review": "28 May 2015"}

Having visited ME regularly with work colleagues, our aunt decided to give us the experience if their roof top bar which not only has a very chic club experience but also provides extensive and breathtaking views despite just being at The Shard. However, our experience left us feeling less chic, trendy, socialising and more like we were in a silent movie. Upon our arrival the concierge was polite and smiley, welcomed us happily, so far so good. We made our way past reception and round to the lift that takes you directly up to the roof top bar. Our aunt had always taken this route never having an issue. However when we reached the lift we were met with a tall handsome lady, with beautifully voluminous hair and a great professional dress sense (so her professional appearance were present but her manners were nowhere to be seen.  She stared at our approach and when we stopped before the lift and told her that we were intending to visit the roof top bar she then abruptly held up her hand and dismissed the idea in a heart beat. No smile, now apology. \"You cannot come in this way you have to go back out the entrance and take the \"club entry\" at the side of the building\"  Okay, bearing in mind we four were the only people there, we obliged. We qued up at a cordoned of make shift line with velvet ropes and made our entry quite swiftly, great we were in! Now for a drink!  Think again. We ended up back at the lifts with our very well dressed unwelcoming friend glaring at us and barking at us to wait aside for a lift to come down. I'm sorry, but we walked back out and all the way around to the side of the building only to end up in the same place?! We found it rather unbelievingly funny and could not stop laughing off our disbelief. Our abrupt friend then said \" is something the matter?\" To which we replied \" sorry we just find it rather funny, when you sent us outside we expected a completely different entrance and here we are back in the same place, the hotel lobby is dead, not a soul in sight you could have just informed of of the new change in policy and allow us acces to one of those lifts, if we're honest we don't feel like spending our money here. you have not made us feel very welcome.\"  She held out her hands shook her head and said \"well I don't mind\"  She sighed and returned to her little desk. We decided to stay and have a drink out of respect to our relative, she really wanted us to have the ME EXPERIENCE, So we obliged only to meet glasses ( plastic which is fair it is a rooftop garden) with lipstick all around the rim. I work for a hygiene company that sells quash, give me a call anytime. We did speak to a manager briefly but left after one drink as we don't feel ME bent over backwards to retain our custom. A bowl of olives for the table would have surfised. Anything to tell us you care. The particular member of staff seemed to have this attitude of snobbery, an upstairs down stairs attitude. \"You don't look like someone worthy of this hotel\"  Just because we are relaxed easy going people does not mean we don't have the funds to spend in your establishment. You should be careful who you mistreat because that person might surprise you, I could have been scouting out potential venues for a very expensive prestigious event. Think about it.  Just a point to operational values, if someone had told us before we went in that non residents must use the side entrance, all of this would have been avoided, unfortunately for you we quickly moved to a much more charming venue called The Rosewood where we spent a lot of money and got on really well with their friendly staff.", "date_of_review": "11 May 2015"}

Karina (sp?) was our server & most pleasant & as efficient as she could be since this place was constantly busy the whole time we were there.

Tapas style food was perfect for this atmosphere & time of day. We had the chicken skewers, beef skewers, dates, crab fritters, leek & ham coquettes, & prawns & chorizo dishes. & a few of them we ordered seconds of. The tapas were staggered as they were ready which meant all were fresh & hot. 3 rounds of Jam Packed, nice fruit bourbon cocktails,to wash it down & after just over 2 hrs we were done.

That is quite a disparity of experiences. Initially this concerned me as my wife and we're making our dining decision but we decided to try it out. Reservations were made for a table for 9pm on a Wednesday night. In order to reserve an outdoor table, there is a minimum spend required which varies from \u00a325 to \u00a3100 per person.  The entrance is discreet hosted by a hostess and doorman. Upon arrival my wife and I were warmly greeted and allowed entry and directed to the elevator that goes to the Radio Rooftop Pattio. Once off the elevator we were again warmly greeted by the Radio hostess Elizabeth (\"Lizzy\"). She confirmed our reservation and the minimum spend requirement. I provided my credit card that was placed inside an envelope and sealed. We were escorted through the indoor bar/lounge area that had a moderately sized crowd with a DJ playing music (not overly loud to inhibit conversation). Our table was on the side facing the London Eye and other London landmarks.  Our server was very attentive and friendly taking both out tapas and drink orders. All the tables were full and service was still quite good with it not being overly pushy but not having to wait too long and searching for the server either. It was a relatively clear evening and the cool breezes reflected that. Thankfully there are numerous heat lamps (both floor and ceiling areas) to relieve a bit of the chill. I found the clientele to be friendly and engaging. We spoke to several people and did not encounter the pretentiones that had been described in earlier reviews. At 10pm the side we were on closed due to neighbourhood noise abatement requirements and we were moved to another table on the other side. The food is tapas style. While I would consider the portions small and expensive, I could not find any fault in any of the offerings that were absolutely delicious!  We both thoroughly enjoyed our drinking & dining experience. All staff we encountered were very friendly and willing to assist. In fact we had three separate severs approach us to take our food/drink orders. I must make a special mention of hostess Elizabeth who was the constant throughout the evening ensuring that our experience was pleasant. A very nice and engaging hostess.  I imagine that the experiences would vary depending on the time of day or the day of the week.

I`ve tried to book a table through their phone number listed on opentable, but answering machine was keep saying there is no availability on any of the days. Then, I went to their webpage and made a reservation, but I faced many rules of the bar that I was amazed: no big parties allowed (parties of 5 has to include girls and boys), on Fridays and Saturdays there is 100 pounds minimum spend on other days 25 pounds, which puts a pressure on you that you have to spend this money no matter what. For reservation they keep your credit card details to make sure you will turn up plus they confirmed twice my reservation before i went there. I`ve already felt stressed and thought I`m meeting the Queen not going to the bar to enjoy a cocktail. When we turned up we been met by a girl downstairs who was more interested in chatting with a colleague than us. After we been greet by receptionist we were given the worst located high table, squeezed in between lounge sofas, then thankfully after my complain they gave us better table. Most of the public there is absolute ZOO, seems like people not coming there to enjoy the view and time but only for proper showing off, which makes atmosphere absolute fake (i personally don`t like it). Design of the bar is really cheap (table, seats, bar stand, broken toilets) comparing even with a lounge which is downstairs. Cocktails and food were nice and not extremely expensive, but 15% service charge surprised me for that level of service we were provided. View of course is great especially during the sunset, but you have to come only in warm summer days as I was feeling constantly cold even we sat inside. Last thing for management note: please look after waitress attire. One waitress was wearing a dress which was not even covering her bum, that looks just ridiculous, and mainly waitresses looked too casual.

People come for the great view, they get friendly and professional service, they go away happy and come back for more. Radio makes money and the clients have a reliable hotspot in London to enjoy. Instead, you pass bouncers at the hotel door who will not let you pass without you acknowledging them, somebody at the bottom of the lift whose only job it is to tell you that it will arrive automatically, then a hostess at the exit of the lift to seat you in a place of her choosing if you are lucky enough for there to be space. In addition, after 10pm half of the terrace is shut - so no view of the Thames, just the BT Tower. The excuse given is that there are hotel rooms on that side requiring silence. We had a room virtually ON The Strand and it was so soundproofed that this excuse made no sense. The strangest thing was the mix of aggressive 'service' and the nightclub-style dress of about half the clientele. I ordered a beer and was told (after no response from the waitress) \"Yes I know what that beer is, thank you!\" - followed by \"well aren't you going to have ANY food?\". The drinks are served in plastic cups which is a joke considering they are 30% more expensive that even the average London prices. We wish we had listened to the reviewers on this site before wasting our energy on Radio. They are either living in a dream world, or this bar is a cover for something else.

I came to the bar again Friday night with a friend and again the service was perfect, so attentive & friendly, it was great. We moved tables a few times and the staff were really accommodating. The cocktails were also awesome! Ricardo was again working and took such great care of us.  I know there can be issues on the door reception on the ground floor, I've encountered that myself and I really hope they look to improve that. Friday night there were no problems aside from the standard look up and down but thankfully we were on the guest list.  I would always recommend this bar - amazing views of London both during the day and also watching the city light up at night. Ive always found the bar-service great and its generally a really nice crowd. If people find it pretentious then they should head to weatherspoons! its really good to be in a bar when people take time to dress well, be in a nice environment and receive great service. Well, I think so anyway!  Enjoy the bar and make your own mind up! i love it there!", "date_of_review": "21 April 2015"}

I've been with some friends that arrived in London from Moscow and wanted to take them to a nice place like Radio Rooftop Bar !!! After we spent 400gbp on food and drinks they said that we ain't allowed anymore for drinks suddenly :))) that absurde !!! Although we haven't bothered nobody, we're just having a nice time, suddenly a manager said that we ain't allowed anymore on drinks ! So we asked him why ? He said that's the their house rule to select clients that drinked too much !!! We drank only a bottle of Ciroc Vodka which is 200gbp and had some food !!! They ain't offering no respect at all for you as a client !!! They're just ripping you off and after finding motives to kick you out for another one to spend they're money !!!!

There is a fairly strict door policy, the smartly dressed group in front of us got turned away due to 'full capacity' however when we got up there the bar was more than half empty.The staff are pretty unwelcoming but it didn't take long to get served. W e were unable to sit down outside because even though a lot of the tables were empty, they were all reserved. I went to the bar at 5pm and by the time I left most of these tables were still unoccupied. It was pretty frustrating having to stand the whole time when i'd just paid \u00a314 for a drink. I would suggest stating what time the table is reserved from, however my guess is that the tables are just saved in the hope that bigger parties will come in and pay for a table. They should be more concerned about ensuring that current customers have a pleasant experience. The atmosphere at Radio bar is pretty dull, many people just trying to look glamorous and acting pretentious. For a better experience I would suggest Sushi Samba in the Heron Tower, Madison rooftop bar at St Pauls or Rooftop Gardens in High St Kensington.

When they first opened, the venue had a cool and trendy vibe about it, with great music and attentive staff. More recently though the bar has developed more of a pretentious vibe, where they've become more picky about the customers they 'choose' to let in. The end result is you tend to get a crowed that conform to a specific look, which feels somewhat forced and unnatural. When you go to a bar like Radio you go on the basis that you understand you'll be paying a little more for the experience and you should make an effort when it comes to appearance. However, a bar like this should also have service and atmosphere to match but Radio Bar fails to deliver on both those respects.  If you're looking for a similar bar but one that meets expectations I'd suggest looking elsewhere. W Hotel is a great alternative and whilst it doesn't offer an outside area their bar often has great atmosphere with live DJ and club.", "date_of_review": "17 April 2015"}

Our group of 25 were refused entry due to the male/female ratio and even when we increased the female headcount they refused entry, citing one reason after another, making stuff up in the end, in spite of that fact we had our event planned for months, had spent thousands, yes thousands, in STK beforehand, preordered our drinks and arranged an area following several conversations with the staff in the run up to the event. We specifically went to STK as we were heading to Radio after our meal, our group were polite, well dressed, not drunk, this was London bar snobbery at its finest. They had no regard whatsoever for the size of the group and where we could go at 11pm, having spent the last 3 hours dining in the restaurant as part of an event we had planned for months. We had females in our group, it was mixed as requested, not a 50/50 mix but this was not once mentioned in the lead up to the event, not once, this 50/50 rule cannot be found on any of the correspondence between myself and the staff at Radio, and it cannot be found on our contract nor on their website. We were not treated at all like a group that had spent a large sum dining with them beforehand or like a group who prearranged this event, more like 25 random people who had walked by and tried to get in on a whim, in fact we were treated more like we had been a rowdy group of beer-guzzling yobbos who were chancing our arm, which we were not. The staff were arrogant, dismissive and completely unreasonable. We have been to far more established clubs and bars in London with the same gender ratio and been treated so much better. Event organizers beware, this place will not make your group feel welcome or will not go out of their way to help you, in fact management were the worst offenders.

Everything from the evening itself to the preparation beforehand in working directly with Radio Rooftop was handled very well. Our team were greeted at the door by the front of house team who took them up via the lift to the bar. The added glam factor really appealed to everybody, as being spoiled by having your own lift attendant is not something we see often within IT! Once we arrived upstairs the views were just spectacular, a panoramic view of the City, breath-taking. The service received was brilliant, Dora our hostess was pretty, very smart, polite and prompt with drinks and food delivery. We were very well look after. I personally thanked her and the management team at the end of the night as everybody really enjoyed themselves. I would definitely recommend Radio Rooftop, whether you are with a large group of people or just a small party. I have seen some negative comments here and I can only say that it\u2019s important that you speak with a venue before you arrive. If you\u2019re in a large group, spend some time contacting Radio Rooftop directly. I did just that, ok at times they were difficult to get hold of over the phone but you have to expect that with a popular venue. E-mail was my best way to confirm dates, food and drinks and really RR were very accommodating with my own specific menu, designed from theirs of course!

We loved it when we first went - incredible views, great drinks, good service and no pretentious teenagers popping bottles of Belvedere! Although it is an expensive bar, it has usually been worth it - you're paying for the experience as well as the drinks (and perhaps, food). However, when introducing (which was probably our 10th) friend to the place, we experienced terrible service and rude staff. Firstly, we arrived and ordered drinks and food and was told by the bar man to ask the woman at the front desk to advise us on where to sit. I walked up to the three members of chatting staff at the front desk, and felt I was rudely interrupting their conversation. The woman eventually turned to face me and I told her we have ordered food, where can we sit to eat? 'You'll have to wait.' she bluntly responded. I politely explained how we need to know if we cannot sit down while we eat. She told me we are able to sit anywhere outside until the reservations turn up. We went outside and found a perfect table for the 3 of us, except there was only one chair. This time, my boyfriend went to speak to the woman. He came back, disgusted. The woman (in a deep conversation, again) had told him we cannot have any more chairs - even though there was a completely empty roped off area with over 30 chairs. So, we stood and eventually our food arrived and as it started to rain, luckily, some chairs became free. The food was fine - I wouldn't recommend it, though. Upon paying the bill, my boyfriend asked to remove the service charge. 'Why?' Was the barman's response. My boyfriend explained he would rather not say. He said he has to tell his manager, so I told him unfortunately, we have experienced bad service on this visit. He didn't say a word.  Unfortunately, we will never be going back to Radio. The staff were rude and pompous and it was a disappointing evening. I am not paying for service that I did not receive just as I would not pay for a drink I did not receive. I didn't expect to have to explain this to the staff. Radio is a nice place to go for one drink, to see the gorgeous view of London. Apart from that, my whole view of it has been thawed by this one experience. ", "date_of_review": "6 March 2015"}

Over the years we have been in most of the so called posh bars in town and always been treated with respect and as if we were valued client\u00e8le, not so at the ME hotel.  The entrance was roped off and I was interrogated to get through, I was asked if I had any other guests joining me and what their gender was? !!  Having crossed the first hurdle, we got to the lift and had to be cross examined by another minion, but this treatment was also meted out to hotel guests trying to go up to the bar. They tried to explain that they were residents, to no effect, and eventually lied and said yes they had a reservatioand gave a name. As there was nothing on her clipboard , she accepted this and let us  go up. Once up there I met up with some of my friends who had passed the entrance exam on condition we did not sit down, not even at the bar, as all areas were reserved but we could go out on terrace and look at view......yippee!  Be warned they add service to all drinks even when you're standing at the bar, it's not optional on the card readerand you have to ask them to take it off and they have to go off and reprint the bill. As you can tell this is what I did, much to the bar lady's chagrin, she asked me why i wasn't happy to pay the charge. I explained because I hadn't had \"service \" I replied me standing at the bar and her doing her job was not \"service\". If her face could have moved it would have been a picture!  Let me also add that this is the first time i have been in an establishment of this attempted calibre that didn't have a cloakroom or offer nibbles of any kind. So we stood round our pile of soggy coats and umbrellas, admired the view, looked at all the empty reserved seating areas and were studiously ignored. When one of my friends tried to get her attention to order some more drinks (20mins), she eventually came over and said she was intimidated by them staring at her as if she'd done something wrong, they were looking at her to try and get served.

The week of Christmas. It is hard to predict how a destination bar may be during this time. It could be rammed. It could be deserted. Media yuppies piling in fuelled with self-congratulation? Celebrities cheersing their comedy show or (soon to follow) work out DVDs? Recently \u2018renovated\u2019 WAGs on the prowl for fat wallets and magazine covers? Another rooftop bar boasting another great view of what is probably the greatest city in the world. It's like catnip to those named. Radio claims to have it all. And it did. It had all of them. We did not have a reservation but being a couple not stumbling around and just celebrating my partner's birthday, we strolled in much to my surprise. The copious amounts of ropes, clipboards and shiny black panelling is designed to give you the impression that this is exclusive. When that rope comes back, you are one of The Lucky Ones. You are one of Wonka's lucky ticket holders. Well done Charlie. You've arrived. Collect your prize. We lived in Dubai so we have seen lots of this (more on that later) so I don\u2019t get the same buzz that I once did. I should say before going further that the staff here were nothing but polite, friendly, courteous and amusing. I reckon they see a lot of 'types' here and they deserve a medal for their perma-smile and unflappable approach. Some reviewers here appear to have had less luck.  The client\u00e8le however ... *cough*. The media types were easily spotted across the bar with their signatory square black glasses and upmarket hipster look. The WAGs circled like malnourished buzzards waiting to feast because it's been so long since they've dined on the impressionable flesh of new money. Well-known British comedian sat in a dark (but sufficiently well-lit) corner enjoying the company of their female 'publicist'. (I'm sure that's the Daily Mail caption on the photo of them leaving.) Is it pricey? You betcha. This spectacle does not come cheap. And neither does the view. \u00a340 for two drinks. Admittedly a cocktail and glass of champagne. Still, skyrises in London are no longer rare and - surprise - they all have bars with views. If you like Kensington Roof Gardens circa 2006 then you will probably love this place. I know I loved it back in the day. The roof terrace outside (booking essential) is novel vs some of the other aforementioned bars in big shiny buildings around London.  Would I come back here? I'm not sure why I would. Having lived in Dubai and London, there are taller buildings in both with less pretentious client\u00e8le, better views and marginally cheaper drinks. There is clear organisation and - to be honest - less try hard fun. But for the prestige thrust upon you in the first five minutes of just trying to get to an elevator, you wouldn't know this place was something special \u2026 until you get to the view. Then the price column in the drinks menu. There\u2019s food available too in case you can\u2019t wait to eat spring rolls. Rooftop bars are about as rare in London as a pizza pasta restaurant now so you really need to pull something out of the bag to stand out, compete and keep the glitterati coming back time after time.  The drinks were good. The staff nice. The view is awesome. I still felt underwhelmed. Shame. If you do not live in London and you are visiting (maybe staying in the hotel which hosts Radio) then you will probably be awestruck which is great. Treat yourself to another high rise bar in London too. For perspective.", "date_of_review": "29 December 2014"}

(Not boring just all parents in our late 30's/early 40's)...To be honest we planned to stop off at Dirty Martinis but it was full so we headed to Radio.  This place should be used as a case study for BAD Management.  The truly surreal experience started at the door when the lady with the clip board (who truly believed she was something special) wanted to evaluate what we looked like! didn't this sort of thing stop back in the 90's??? after 5 minutes of being looked up and down, we were escorted down a dark corridor ( fire exit entrance by its appearance) and being looked up and down by large door man with ear pieces we arrived at an elevator. I think these door staff and hosts are instructed to work in silence and make the clients fee really uncomfortable. ( this they excel at).  Now to the actual bar, lovely looking place with stunning views, but that's were it stops. The hostesses, bar staff, bouncers (which I counted 7 for a very small place, all standing around talking into their cuff links) and the randomly placed others all without fail looked us up and down as we entered. They certainly know how to make you feel welcome? The prices are step even for London and the beer was warm and served in old plastic glasses. The people in place are very special too as most just pouted and stared out across the room looking vacant, (you know the type).  The DJ was very good and set a good vibe, ruined by the air kisses/hugging and selfie taking pouters.  I am not sure who runs this place but they really need to address all the issues this place has... Time Out gives them 1 out of 10 and they don't fare much better on here. They need to listen as it appears a lot of people want to hold business meeting here without being dictated to...

The bar has comfortable tables inside and out on the balcony - The outside you are surrounded by London lights and kept warm with the outdoor heater flames and blankets.

The staff at the lift which takes you straight up to the bar were not welcoming. Then there was the table service which works with a tab service - the waitress was very pleasant and welcoming however this soon faded when the bar got another 20 people and she seemed to be the only one running around serving all the tables and so she became less friendly. We were there early on a Sunday around 8.00pm so it wasn't as packed as i have seen it before. Someone from my table asked her for a drink and she snapped - This certainly made us leave early.

From our first contact with the reservations lady to leaving the venue at 2.30am, we were treated fantastically.

I wouldn't be put off by the reviews, yes the place does have snobby people, but where in a high class place like this will you NOT find snobby people, if that is not your cup of tea then do not go BUT if you enjoy good music, good food and amazing views then THIS is the place to go!

Whilst the venue, decor and anticipated views were good, I am afraid to say that the rest was really quite extraordinarily bad! The food at the STK restaurant was just about OK, but the service was hurried and disjointed - we were left waiting on several occasions between courses and ordering drinks at the table. However we were not going to let that spoil the evening as we were looking forward to drinks at the Radio Rooftop Bar. Despite having booked in advance - we were refused entry by the attendant 'hostess', who would give us no meaningful explanation as to why we were being turned away. We returned to the main hotel reception and asked to see a manager who might be able to shed some light on the situation - and that was when things started to get sereal.  We were then introduced to the STK restaurant manager who very cordially asked if we would like a free drink at the bar in the STK restaurant while we waited for the general manager - he recognised us from the lunchtime sitting and was bemused as to why we wer not admitted to the Radio Bar.  However when the general manager arrived he explained that the reason for not being admitted to the Radio Bar it was because we were drunk - REALLY!!!! - AND IF SO WHY HAD THE RESTAURANT MANAGER DECIDED TO OFFER US ANOTHER DRINK!!!! He then told us that if we did not leave we would be escorted from the premises. Honestly in all my 20 years of working in the capital I have never experience such a bizzare level of customer service. There is however a happy ending to this story - being gentlemen who thrive in adversity we went on to have a superb evening - the great thing about London is there are choices... ...just don't choose ME London, the STK Restaurant, nor indeed the Radio Rooftop Bar (if in fact you are ever admitted)...!!!!", "date_of_review": "8 December 2014"}

The staff are extremely rude and under trained in how to speak to their paying customers. I visited with a girlfriend last month and spent a lot of money (approx. \u00a3300 for just us 2 girls) on poor cocktails and even poorer tapas plates however undeterred I decided to give this place another go. We arrived on time for our reserved table however as it was raining outside we entered through the main hotel lobby instead of the dedicated entrance to the side of the hotel. No problem you would think as they both lead to the only designated lift to the roof top however the extremely rude girl attending the lift told us we had to leave the hotel and re-enter via the side. Bewildered, it just didn't make sense however we refused to do this as it was raining and she eventually let us in 'her' lift. To make matters worse once we arrived at the bar we were instructed to leave a credit card and given a note to read their T's&C's that there was a minimum charge per person. All this information was given to me when I made the reservation (for which they took credit card details over the phone) but to be told again by another exceptionally rude member of staff proved very embarrassing in front of my guests. To make matters worse the cocktails were over-sweetened with a nasty syrup by a pretty crap barman. The Manager came over to us and apologised for the way his staff behave however he was not much better which proves why the staff are so poorly trained. He did however provide us with a free round of 3 drinks which we left on the table and made a swift exit. We couldn't get out of this place quick enough. When we got downstairs it was still raining and I waited inside the building for my car to pick us up. There was not a sole queuing to get in this place and nobody else apart from me and the door girl by the entrance but yes, you've probably guessed again this cold, rude cow on the door insisted that I stand outside and waited. I was not blocking any doorway and I was on my own - this is obviously the normal behaviour of the staff of this place. Yes it has the views, yes its got the looks but this place needs to buck up its ideas when trying to attract paying customers. This was a Tuesday night and the place was less than half its capacity with relatively un-cool people which says it all really but it is a shame when it could be a really cool place attracting the hippest of London's society if only it was run better.

We booked about 4 months ago. In the lead up to our arrival, we confirmed our booking and also the dress code for the bar. We were told that what we had planned to wear would be more than acceptable. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a fake smile and a \"one moment please\" while a manager was called to the door. She informed us that unfortunately our male to female ratio was not in accordance with their entry policy, as we only had one lady with us. Incidentally, she had flown from Australia for our Christmas party which must have been a big disappointment to have this unfold. We insisted that this policy was not quoted to us during our booking. If it had been advised, we could have chosen another place to book. Why would we waste our time trying to enter otherwise? Despite our insistence, she continued to tell us how sorry she was, but that she wouldn't be able to let us in. After some mild debate and a whole lot of \"policies\" seemingly being made up on the spot, it became abundantly clear we wouldn't be let in. As we debated, a large queue of men in suits was forming at the door. We assumed of course that they would also be refused entry. Alas, as we walked away a little bitter and twisted, the group of men at the door was given the look up and down, and subsequently let through the door. Double standards much? Meanwhile, we were left the daunting task of finding another bar in the Strand late on a Friday night. The staff at this bar should be ashamed they work for a venue that is so exclusive that it borders on sexism. I wonder if we would have received the same treatment as a group of women? There is no space in our modern society for closed stereotypes to be applied based on your sex, let alone your appearance. Despite this dated, idiotic rule, the way the staff handled the situation was dismal. We were simply denied entry and the staff clearly had no intention of resolving it to the betterment of their customers. Although, judging by most of the other reviews here, we dodged a bullet.

The previous comments about the awful people employed to guard the entrance are quite correct. When I visited there were three of them, one woman and two men. When I asked if the bar was full she looked me up and down and said that yes I could go up as there were spaces available but could not guarantee that my daughter who was some 10 minutes behind me would be able to get in. She also said that if my daughter was not appropriately dressed she would not be allowed in. She was on her way from work so obviously there would be no problem there. The woman obviously had been at the back of the queue when they were handing out charm and made me feel like she was doing me a massive favour.  I decided to take the risk that there would not be a stampede of guests within the next ten minutes and wait for my daughter upstairs in the bar. By the time she arrived (appropriately dressed) 15 minutes later, I had only just been served. The wait at the bar is ridiculous and when you do get served they too make you feel like they are doing you a favour. If you decide to run a bar tab, they take your credit card from you and keep it. They do not take an impression of it and hand it back to you, they keep it and give you a plastic card with a number on it. When I queried this (as I have never experienced this before) the girl behind the bar sneered at me as she explained the process. The view from the terrace is indeed very nice, although drinking from plastic glasses is definitely a let down. My daughter ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail which she said was not freshly made and tasted disgusting. My drink was equally awful with a mixer added without asking how much I wanted. This resulted was a glass full of ice and mixer and hardly any spirit. Obviously we only had one drink and decided to leave. This resulted in about a 10 minute wait to get anyone's attention before I could pay the bill. Amazingly they have the cheek to put a 15% service charge on the bill and then give you the option to add another gratuity when you use the payment terminal. Unbelievable!!! We could not wait to leave this truly awful place which is guarded by people who have never been to charm school, serviced by people who obviously feel they are doing the world a favour by working behind a bar and frequented by people who are prepared to be treated in this way just because the bar is popular at moment. We left and went to the Savoy for our pre-dinner drink where the service was as impeccable as ever and where they value your custom and treat you correctly. Avoid this dire bar at all costs.", "date_of_review": "24 September 2014"}

The outside seating is fairly comfortable, spaced well around a glass room that reminded me of an airport lounge, and filled mostly with corporate types and tourists.  Quite tasty but very pricey tapas-style food in tapas-size portions to go with very pricey wine \u2013 the prices certainly not reflecting either the quality of the wine or the dish ingredients. Decent enough cocktails, but then, at the price, they jolly well should be.  Service is friendly enough (for this you pay 15% extra on top of the already exorbitant prices) but so very efficient that you feel that they\u2019re practically forcing alcohol down your neck so they can ramp up the bill by replenishing your order at breakneck speed. Way too pushy. You virtually have to beat them away if you don\u2019t like the intrusions of having your drinks refilled, or of being asked if you\u2019d like another drink, before your glass is anywhere near empty. Going to the bathroom is a disconcerting fun-fair experience. If you\u2019ve been sitting outside on a sunny day, before entering the near pitch-blackness, best you allow ample time for your eyes to acclimatise lest you won\u2019t be able to see the floor let alone find the lavatory. Thinking about it as I write, the fact that I enjoyed a couple of hours here was down almost entirely to the company I was in, with the view providing a nice backdrop.

We arrived at the Radio Bar circa 4.00 pm (meeting our 22 year old daughter and partner there). We arrived with our 17 year old son and were greeted at the lift (via the hotel lobby). Lovely warm welcome by the lady at the lift entrance and on our arrival in the bar. The following 2 hours were great. Superb bar with amazing staff \u2013 really attentive, friendly and helpful. At around 6.00 pm I received a call from our third child \u2013 he was about to arrive. Given he had not been to the bar before I thought it easier to pop down and meet him in the lobby. Which is where the evening took a very different turn. I meet my 20 year old son (who was smartly dressed) and tried to return to the bar using the lift that I had come down in. The security guard informed me bluntly that I could not use the open lift and had to exit the hotel to use another entrance. I explained that I had been in the bar for 2 hours, that my family were still there and that I had come down in that lift 2 minutes before. In an aggressive manner he informed me that he had not seen me use the lift (mainly due to being engrossed in what appeared to be a flirting with a colleague working the lift area). I informed him this was ridiculous but realised he was now performing in the alpha male role to impress the young lady. As we turned the corner outside the hotel heading towards the side entrance it was apparent that the next security guard was in radio communication with the first. The first thing he did was ask for my sons ID \u2013 which he produced. We were told that he couldn\u2019t come in as he wasn\u2019t 21. I explained that we had been there for 2 hours, my family still upstairs, I had a tab running, etc. The guard became aggressive and told me that it was policy not to let anyone in under 21. When I mentioned that my 17 year old son was already in the bar he started chatting to the other guard on the radio. I was becoming increasingly annoyed at this point. I am a respectable middle aged man and in no way a trouble maker, my family are well educated presentable young adults \u2013 all we wanted was a nice start to the evening. I again asked that I be let up to the Bar \u2013 at which point the guard became incredibly rude and aggressive body language \u2013 informing me that \u201cI bet you are used to giving it the big\u2019un and getting your own way all the time\u201d along with other expressions that I would have expected at a low end night club in the early hours of the morning. I told him I had a tab running \u2013 at which point he told me that my son still couldn\u2019t come in. He was quickly escalating in his aggression so I called my wife and asked her and the rest of my family to leave.  I went to hotel reception asking to speak with a manager and was told that they had nothing to do with the bar.  I have been in contact with the Hotel today and heard nothing. The way in which the security people behaved was nothing short of disgraceful and is so completely out of line with the environment that the owners have clearly worked hard (and invested) in. Great bar, great bar staff\u2026 if you get past Dastadly and Muttley.", "date_of_review": "20 August 2014"}

Once we stepped into the lift we had to listen to the host complaining about how bored she was and how she couldn't wait to finish her hosting shift. We then arrived at the floor and walked into total mayhem as there was clearly no manager present who was running the place and subsequently we wasn't seated, advised or directed to the bar. Once at the bar we had to wait 20 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us. Considering there were 6 members of staff behind the bar, they seemed more interested in talking between themselves then actually providing any service. Once we finally got served I ordered a gin and tonic with the bar lady she walked off and came back with a pint of tonic water and ice cubes and the gin was clear drowned in the glass!!! there was not question of preference to which gin I would like or how much tonic.. slim line or normal.... To top this off my drink was served in a large dirty plastic pint pot and for this drink I was provided with, I received a charge of \u00a325. This place has great potential but I can say delivers on none. This totally spoilt what was a great hotel experience!! 5* it is not, I wouldn't even give it 1*. I could rant about this endlessly and I would highly recommended that you don't visit this bar as you also will be disappointed.  This was a birthday treat and I ended up feeling rather embarrassed  Say no more!!", "date_of_review": "22 August 2014"}

Went to Radio Bar for the 2nd time, well before the rush, (only 4pm) and told to wait even though so many unreserved tables empty. Finally let through, got a table, made to get a tab after waiting 20mins to be served.  Ordered 2 cocktails, nice. Wanted to order a 2nd round, waitresses rude, flutter around ignoring everyone. Went to bar myself to buy more cocktails, meanwhile my sister had moved to better table with more of a view.  To my disgust, a 15% service charge added to the bill even though I got it from the bar myself. \u00a328.75 for 2 cocktails, which were mediocre this time and nothing like the first round.  Shared our table with 2 other ladies who were struggling to find seats or be seated. They left soon after getting their own drinks.  Soon after, waitresses started throwing socialising guests from tables mid-drinks, the tables were now magically \"reserved,\" you guessed right, we were turfed off next.  So the tab cost another \u00a328.75 for our first 2 drinks including another 15% service charge!  SO almost \u00a360 out of pocket, rude and ridiculous lack of service, all for a great view!

Ricardo: his eyes like the deep crystal waters of the Caribbean; his skin like the caramel undertones of a delectable nougat. He kindly offered to rustle together what he could from the kitchen, resulting in a sweet, sumptuous melange of flavours orchestrated together in a symphony of fruit.

However, after last nights episode I now can! I was meeting some friends in town for a drink and something to eat. They were waiting for me in the bar and had spoken to the Manageress to make sure that I would be able to get up just after 6pm. She agreed. At 18:05 I arrived at the lift in the hotel to be told by the 'host' that I would not be allowed up without a reservation. I was also told that I could not stand by the lift as this area was for hotel guests only! I phoned my friend who spoke to the manageress who then denied agreeing to let me up saying that was a long time ago. Finally she agreed so I went back to the lift. Before I could even finish my sentence the 'host' told me that I would not be allowed in. A member of security then walked right up to me, only a couple of inches away from my face, and said that I could not be in this area. Why not? There are three lifts and one says 'Radio Bar'. Obviously the custom of their hotel guests is more important than that of the guests that do not stay with them. As suggested, I walked around the side of the building to the other entrance. Again I was greeted by two rude security guards and another rude 'host'. Again I was told I would not be let in. After a third time of calling my friend I was finally allowed entry.  I am appalled at how rude, unfriendly and obnoxious the staff at the Radio Bar and the Me Hotel are. Clearly customer service does not exist. And after reading the below reviews with comments from the Management Company saying that they are always looking at ways of viewing customer service, clearly they are either being too slow or just saying it to try and appease customers.  For those of you that do read this review, I really would recommend that you stay away from here, unless you want to be in the presence of extremely rude staff and security.  I shall not be returning to this venue and would even go as far as saying that is one of most unpleasant experiences of customer service that I have had in a Central London Bar.", "date_of_review": "16 August 2014"}

During the week days the queue can be heaving so turning up on a Saturday was a pleasant straight walk inside. It is spectacular and it's lovely to take someone there that admires the views.   As all the seats are taken, you're on a high alert for the next available seat though we stood next to the bar and watched cocktails being made, including our own. These do not come cheap, not much change from \u00a330 for two cocktails, so we made these last. You definitely feel that you need to dress up, to be approved less you get kicked out! So it's quite a posey place which might make some people feel uncomfortable. But if you love fine views, it's definitely worth taking a look. Otherwise, if it's pouring rain, head down to the ground floor and order drinks there, it's much more laid back.

More staff, ie. more than one bar tender! We went to radio bar sat 09-08. 2.30 table reserved. Contrary to other reviews found the staff welcoming and friendly - might be the difference between weekend and weekdays. Was not too busy at 2.30, however, we still had to wait about 15 mins for 2 cocktails. We then ordered a bottle of champagne and they seemed to loose the order and we eventually got it after about 25 mins. It seemed to get really busy about 4pm and then it all seemed to go a bit haywire. Service became very slow. We were suddenly told we would have to vacate the table. We had not been informed at time of booking or on arrival. Considering we were onto our second bottle of champagne and only half way through they did not offer to find us another table although we did get a 30 min warning. Without wishing to sound demanding if they looked after us we would probably have stayed longer and spent more money but I don't think that this is their priority as currently this is one of the places to go and be seen and hence they have the choice of patronage.  All that being said it is a nice place to go and has one of the best rooftop bar views in London.

Also for somewhere that according to the host- the person who takes you up and down in the lift- only wants select visitors, they haven't got select staff- not only poor service but also our male colleagues didn't know where to look at the entrance desk as the lady behind the counter was wearing a dress that was see through without a bra!

This was completely unfounded, and my entire party had an absolutely fantastic time. The service on a Saturday night was flawless; we had some champagne on our table, the staff constantly came over checking whether any of my party required a top up. The quality of the drinks and cocktails were outstanding and comprehensive, as was the very chilled lounge type atmosphere. The highlight of this bar is of course its fantastic views, which are simply breathtaking.  I would definitely recommend making a reservation in advance, as understandably this bar is very popular and it also avoids disappointment in gaining entry; the reservation team [Katerina and Niklas] is incredibly friendly and responsive, and despite a number of last minute requests to change my reservation time and party size were very accommodating.  I would highly recommend this true gem of a bar in London and would like to thank the entire Radio bar team for ensuring my evening was perfect.

Bathed in the (very rare!) beautiful summer sunshine we spent the evening gazing out at the incredible view over London, drinking totally delicious cocktails served by smiley, patient and helpful waitresses. The food plates that kept wafting by were too tempting so we decided to order a selection for ourselves and what a good move that was! Absolutely delicious selection of little tapas dishes which were just ideal for an evening like this, especially when with a group of people. The music was also worth a mention too. Not sure how often she's there but there was a wicked girl DJ'ing some fantastic music which really was the icing on the cake of a totally brilliant evening.  I'm also keen to mention in response to some of the other reviews that I read below that although I agree that the girl on the door was not the friendliest of sorts, I wouldn't want her job for anything. The arrogance and rudeness that she had to deal with from some of the potential clientele in the short while that we were waiting, had to be seen to be believed. Really. The same for the staff upstairs. I honestly don't know how they keep their cool. Perhaps that's the downside of a place that's got so much going for it but if you can blinker out some of the more unpleasant arrogant attitudes knocking around amongst your fellow drinkers, then it really is the most wonderful place to spend an evening and I couldn't personally recommend it more highly.", "date_of_review": "23 July 2014"}

He wouldn't give any reason as to why. She called me so I came down. He was very rude and said in so many words, who asked you. My friend was so upset she left and went home. I saw another friend walking up so I waited by the rope. The bouncer then said \"move, stand over there\". I was so put out by his rudeness I was shocked. Later we ordered peppers stuffed with cheese which was vile. Then went to the bar to pay for our bill (because no one served us at our table) and we're greeted by the second rude gentleman of the evening, the barman. We asked to split the bill 5 ways and he told me \"he was too busy and had other people to serve. And that we had to pay on one card\" we did in the end because he pretty much refused otherwise.

The bar is well decorated and the view over London is pleasant, especially on a summer's evening. That is about all that can be said about Radio Rooftop Bar.  On entry, we were greeted by a woman who had a natural unfriendliness about her, not to worry, we thought, not everybody is born with a cheerful disposition. We informed her that we wanted to have a drink to which she inquired if we'd like a table, naturally, we said yes. She then informed us, in a very matter-of-fact manner, that a table would require a \u00a3100 minimum spend per person. We just wanted a casual drink for an hour or so, spending an arm, a leg, and maybe some kidney, wasn't in our plan. When she was met with our shock, a shock which she obviously could not understand, she just simply reiterated the fact and told us that that was how it was.  Now I understand that bar policy isn't decided by the front of bar woman, or whoever she was, but her attitude left me in amazement. When we, once again, said we just wanted a simple drink, she instructed that we could have a drink at the bar, in a way, that said \"you're obviously too poor to be here.\". I seriously did not appreciate being spoken to in this way, especially when I have come to spend money in the establishment in which she works. I don't feel the need to talk down to any one, even if they are serving me, I therefore do not tolerate being spoken to in such manner, especially when I'm paying for a service. Anyway that was that. The cocktails were ok. Nothing to ring home about. The people there are awful. Just a bunch of women hungry for men, who are all too happy about their appetite, and then some couples trying to live the highlife, instagram-ing their every cocktail.

The service was pretty dreadful although the view was nice this place is really poor. It wants to be a high end champagne bar but poor service, door staff who think theyre better than the customers who are there and over priced drinks make me think this is a dreadful spot. I would avoid this place at all costs.

I complained. Silly me. Condescending, rude service with dirty looks and snide comments all round. The worst was when one of the girls asked a member of the male door staff to take a picture he said \"go **** yourself\"!!!!!! I could pick him out of a line up if required. I am horrified.

Service was pretty decent and the food, a mixture of tapas was lovely, however, we had to request they wipe down the table before our food arrived as it was quite dirty and it did begin to rain quite heavily and we were in an area that wasn't covered. We were informed that there was nowhere else for us to sit. They made quite a big deal out of finding a new area for us and had an issue when we asked that the minimum spend be lifted, as why would we stay? As for the attitude regarding people's attire, given that many people there were staying in the hotel anyway, they certainly weren't dressed up.

On the other side, every outdoor table had a reserved sign on it. we quickly worked out that they are there just so the staff can decide who sits where. Ordered a white wine \u00a39, and a bottle of corona, \u00a36.50. Now I don't mind paying a bit more for drinks to drink in a nice bar, but when the barman proceeded to pour my corona into a plastic glass, which was warm by the way and drop a lime into it, I was losing patience. Paid the very rude man and returned to my friends. It was only then that I checked my change and thought I had been done. No, my friends said check your receipt and sure enough there was a FIFTEEN % service change. - For ordering my own drinks at the bar. What a joke. The next time, I ordered I asked my server to remove the service charge to which she made a song and dance about it and said she would have to get her manager to remove it and then she proceeded to serve someone else and leave me stagnating there like a tool. Eventually, with no manager present, the original bargirl went to the till, and removed the charge that she originally said she couldn't.  To sum up, this is an extremely rude, bar with some lovely views of London skyscape, that charges 15% service charge on everything and makes a a big song and dance about it if you ask to have it removed. I would be very suspicious of the positive reviews here, or else they came from people who weren't paying or have any interaction with the staff.

W had to point this out 3 times to waitress as she insisted on luring us warm wine. Finally a cooler arrive and we had to use ice to make it cool. Second bottle ordered and this time it arrived in an ice bucket (which contained no ice!) and the wine was warm again. By the third bottle we were taking bets on what would happen next. We had an ice bucket, we had ice, the bottle was lovely and cold, but the waitress didn't open it and didn't leave a cork screw so it sat taunting us for nearly 30 mins and us asking 6 times could someone open the wine before we could enjoy it.

She was informed we were unable to book. She then asked us to walk back out of the hotel and walk round the block to the 'no reservations' entrance, where we may be allowed in! We were shocked but thought we would try it anyway, and the roped off area was lifted (how kind) to allow us to enter, and we arrived back at the same lift looking at the same 'lady' (not). It gets worse as we spent \u00a324 on a glass of Mo\u00ebt and a dry martini, walked onto the terrace, 2 people vacated a table that we then sat at, took in the view and were faced with another 'lady' who asked us to vacate the table as it was booked? To book is impossible, and it had just become free. We were beginning to feel most unwelcome as 'senior customers' and finished our drinks and left the building. We have a reservation next weekend in Claridges bar, where we are always made to feel welcome to enjoy our champagne, and suggest to the Manager of the Radio Bar (who seems extra busy with more than enough complaints)that to keep his bar from the same fate as many new establishments in London, who have their day, he should at least employ staff who understand what the word 'RESPECT' means, and to take care with their ageist attitudes.

The service throughout the night was average, at best, apart from one girl named Nica - very friendly and warm and nothing was a problem. I came back last night with a friend and, again, the service was indifferent. When my friend arrived, she was made to stand and wait before being able to enter the lift and she saw how the door staff (down at street level) spoke to potential guests of Radio and was unimpressed. We stayed for a few drinks and then decided to go downstairs to the Italian restaurant in the same hotel - Cucina Asselina, We were greeted by Yvonne, a lovely Irish lady, and taken to our seat and she asked how our night had been until that point. We just gave a very throwaway remark that we had been at Radio and that the views were amazing, but that the service hadn't been great and that you aren't made to feel welcome. That was it and then we had a lovely dinner - the service in this restaurant was great. Towards the end of the meal, a guy approached us and asked if we minded if he sat down and he explained that he was Javier Molina - Manager of Radio - and that Yvonne had mentioned to him that our experience of Radio hadn't been altogether positive. He apologised profusely and said that he wanted to change our opinion and so invited us back up when we had finished to have a complimentary drink as a further gesture of apology. He then left and 15 minutes later, came back again to see if we wanted to go back to the bar. We decided to go back and he brought us up and offered us a table and invited us to a glass of Champagne each. We then saw the lovely Nica (who I had met on my last visit) and, again, she was a star. So warm and chatty and genuinely appeared to be interested in us and to care about our situation. Overall, when I see the comments below, I do understand where people are coming from as the Door Team are not at all friendly and nor were the Welcome Team in the bar when you enter but the fact that Yvonne (from the restaurant 10 floors down) took what we said and cared enough to call up to the bar and then Javier came down made all the difference. Little tiny things can change your opinion of a place and following last night, my friend and I will definitely return to Radio and I really do hope that they are able to change a few more people's views on this bar with an incredible roof top terrace with almost unparalleled views in London.", "date_of_review": "25 April 2014"}

Following a botched visit in July, (see my review from 11 July) I vowed never to go here again \u2013 until I was invited by a broker / business relationship who hosted a few clients here (I accepted the invite before I knew where we would go). When confirming the details, the broker asked me if I could bring some female friends as the group would be a bit male-heavy and when booking, he had been asked by Radio Rooftop staff to specify the number of females in his party and come up short. I assumed my host was making this up, but on the night other people confirmed that on entry, they were again asked at the entrance how many women they would bring. Rather awkward to think I might have been invited because I am a woman rather than a business partner. As if it was a meat market rather than a business reception! The bar itself was a huge disappointment. The service was incredible slow. I have been a waitress myself and I am sure I could singlehandedly double the turnover of an evening by simply getting on with it. My goodness the staff was inefficient, one person of our group would walk up to the bar to order, only to return after 10 \u2013 15 minutes with the message that somebody would come to take our order. Another 10 \u2013 15 minutes later, somebody might, or might not, come to take our order. This order might, or might not, be delivered at some point during the evening, but it was a bit of roulette. Bar snacks or any kind of nibbles were unavailable (or we were simply never shown the menu despite asking). Notwithstanding the steep prices and the fact it was only early evening (6 \u2013 8pm) when I was there, all drinks were served in plastic rather than glass (except the wine which for some reason did arrive in a glass) which was just ridiculous given we were in what is supposed to be a trendy lounge bar (as opposed to an open air music festival or a football match). Speaking of \u201ctrendy\u201d, even at this early stage of the evening, the music was so loud that any kind of verbal communication was out of the question. When we stood up to be able to hear each other better, we were repeatedly asked to sit down again in the area we had reserved, standing up was apparently not allowed although I am still trying to work out why that would have been a problem.

Maybe the tables are reserved but you already feel like they are reserved for people who the staff may chose are 'good enough'. No friendly staff to tell you have it works, as in.. Ladies free tables over here, waitress service or order at the bar. Or all the tables are reserved but your welcome to stand at the bar...

No smile, no chat from the staff but then again they don't need to earn the 12.5% service charge you have to pay when ordering....

The worst would be the staff, that best can be described as people who have worked at the same place for thirty years and have been tired of it for the last twenty-nine years. Just that they were not old enough to have worked at a place for thirty years. Not rude, but VERY uninspired - a smile seemed to be lightyears away. This goes for both the staff at the door (with one exception) as well as the waitresses taking orders at the tables.  Somewhere in the middle are the drinks. Quite overpriced, but decent. They appeared to mainly use premium brands and there were lots of fresh fruit, herbs and berries in the bar. Conclusion: Today it feels like a place that wants to be a hot spot, but fails to achieve it. It's a shame, because I really think that this could be a great bar if they just replaced the staff (or management?) and changed the profile of the place, to focus more on good drinks and a relaxed atmosphere where the staff strives to make guests feel welcome. Would not visit again.", "date_of_review": "24 April 2014"}

It was a birthday celebration and my friend had tried to pre-book a table but was told you can only reserve with a minimum spend of \u00a3100 per person. My friend decided against this option and therefore we arrived promptly to secure a table before 5pm. I arrived first with two colleagues to find all the tables inside were reserved. However, a member of staff told us that we could use one of the reserved tables, as the party who were holding them had decided to use the outside terrace area. Not long after other friends turned up (now after 5pm) and told us how rude the bouncers on the door to them. My friends explained to the door staff they were with a group of friends already in Radio Bar, however the door staff looked them up and down without a hint of a smile, asking if they were on the guest list. My friends explained again they were not on the guest list but friends were waiting upstairs. Against this was met with a discourteous glance from the door staff, who eventually let them in but made them feel unwelcome before they had even got in the lift up to the bar. When the rest of our party turned up we took a couple of chairs from the next empty table (which still had reserved signs on it but no people) which seemed to cause the staff real concern. My friend and I became aware of Radio staff pointing at our group continuously, obviously bothered about us sitting at this table. It started to make us feel very uncomfortable and a little later, a senior member of Radio staff came over to tell us off for taking chairs from all his tables (at this point there were still NO OTHER PEOPLE at these tables). I pointed out that his colleague had said we could sit there to which he replied, he was expecting 200 people that evening and we were taking up chair space. He was very rude and made us feel like we were second class citizens and perhaps not of the calibre he was expecting!  My friends, who stayed a little later than me, confirmed that the reserved tables were, in fact, not taken for the rest of the evening. They went on to buy champagne and wine and spend a fair amount too, despite being made to feel not worthy in the first place. I personally work in events, marketing and PR, regularly take out clients to various restaurants and bars around London, and I personally would avoid going back there like the plague.  I had a similar experience last time I tried to get in there at 5pm on a Friday night last summer. Door staff with clip boards and guest lists making people feel worthless. No thanks Radio Bar!

After having a delicious dinner, and going to the Theatre, a party of about 20 of us (mainly age 35+) walked into the hotel's main entrance, to then be told by some snooty chap that we had to go around the side of the building. So we all walked to the side of the building, and a disgustingly rude lady with a clipboard told the manager of this company that we were not on the list. Well, it all kicked off, the manager was extremely angry and demanded he speak to the manager of the Bar. So we all stood there in the rain, and the manager came down. Straight away he apologized for the lady's rudeness and let us straight in, where we were taken to the lifts. People were stopped and we were allowed to go straight up and were taken to a private cornered off area on the balcony. With regards to the Bar itself, nothing too special to be honest, but the views were beautiful outside and although it was a chilly evening, some waiters quickly got us lots of heaters to keep us warm. Although everything was pre-paid for by the company, I did have a quick glance at the drinks menu and it all seemed so over priced. Luckily, we had unlimited bottles of champagne and the service was impeccable but no doubt that was probably because the company had paid a bloody load for all of this!  Please take note: Don't expect anyone dressed in anything but a Prada Suit, or a Chanel dress, it was very obvious that only a certain type of snooty snobster come here, in which the woman look at you as if you just aren't good enough to be here.

Meantime Grazia, was doing some research to help us and she came back by saying that the manager has said there was no problem in setting the tables together. That made us so happy. We had a lovely dinner and enjoyed the atmosphere very much. The other waiter, Roberto, was also a sweetheart, always asking if we needed something else, very attentive. Grazie mille and keep it up!!

To start with I found the clipboard/have-you-booked attitude quite offensive when I was only going for a drink at 6.30pm. While the lady wasn't rude to me, 'friendly' is not a word which would come to mind for describing her. I was then told that if I wasn't staying in the hotel I should be using the street entrance and not the hotel entrance - even though they both use the same lift. When I was finally allowed past the bouncer on the lift and upstairs to the bar, the lift doors opened and it was like going into a nightclub - at 6.30pm! - the music was so excessively loud you couldn't hear yourself talk. Again we went through the have-you-booked routine and when I said I hadn't I was told we would be 'allowed' to stand at the bar or have one of the tables in the lobby by the lift. I walked round the bar to see if my friend was already there and finding that she wasn't I waited on one of the tables by the lift until she arrived. We ended up moving our chairs close together and leaning into each other to enable us to hold a conversation, which we did until we'd finished our drinks and then left. I found the whole experience completely ridiculous and really don't like this idea of having to book a table just to go out for a drink, quite aside from the fact that the music was not just loud but absolutely deafening so early in the evening. Needless to say it will be quite some time before I return.", "date_of_review": "1 February 2014"}

We arrive at the lift and there was only us there and a girl leaning against the wall chatting to a chap and they were laughing and giggling close together so we assumed they were guests. After waiting for a lift for 3 mins or more, one came , we got in it and it didn't have a button for the bar floor level 10. We got out again, girl was still chatting and flirting away - within two foot of us, we got back in having made it loud and clear we were confused. My husband then asks the girl could she possibly help us and she informs us she was the lift attendant!!!!!!! Seriously! Not only that, the chap she was flirting with a staff member from the restaurant, as he travelled up with us in the lift and went straight to the booking desk to work. They need to stop payingher wage immediately. Esp as she thought it was funny we had stuggled to find the correct lift and said \"so many people do that\". Really?????? Might it be you are there to do a job and just ignoring customers?? We were completely ignored by stuck up staff in the bar, so made our own way out of a very difficult door to the terrace. I ordered a cappucino and glass of Prosecco, only to be informed 5 mins later they had run out of milk! I kid you not. I literally laughed in her face and said how can you run out of milk in a place this size - it cannot happen. What you mean is the bar has run out of milk and no-one can be bothered to go and get some from downstairs. Finally, my coffee arrived, but not the prosecco as they don't serve by the glass! Had a nice light lunch of pulled pork and chilli fries - no complaints there. Views were lovely, heaters ample for a terrace lunch outside, mid December. As we left, there were 5 staff mooching around, not one was smiling, or even bothering to catch our eye and smile and say goodbye, somehing you would expect in a service industry. When I visited the ladies loo - the seat was completely broken and propped up on the side. All in all - I was amazed how bad this experience felt and glad we had just popped in out of the bue whilst passing and not made a special trip. Will not recommend and if anything will ensure I tell all my friends how bad the place was and not to be fooled by the glossy photos and PR.

My guests & i arrived 6.15pm, & i approached the blonde girl with the clip board, told her my name, she just shook her head, & said \"NO,\" Whilst i was explaining i had made credit card booking she walked away. HOW CRAP iS THAT, The door man now stepped up to me & said \"move away from this pavement\" as leaning towards me, to which i replied \"NO i'm still in conversation with this girl in an attempt to find out whats going on,\" She said we didn't have reservation, so I pulled the printed e mail as proof from my pocket. She didn't even look at it she simply said \"your credit card will not be charged\" ( which proves she new what i was talking about & the procedure i had followed) So despite telephoning your booking, with your name, number of guests, ( mixed, well dressed) time of arrival & giving your credit card number, THIS IS NOT A BOOKING according to these muppets. The blonde girl with the clip board should have sued the charm school she attended, because she clearly hasn't learned anything.

Although I was slightly shocked that I was expected to pay a minimum spend of \u00a3100 a girl ( 9 of us) to be on their guest list and acquire a table for us. Bearing in mind we had met at 3pm had drinks at home, then been to Gauchos and only planned to be there 3 hours. From 9pm-12am although we were told we could have the table until 3am. I was told that on a Saturday the music was a mix of everything. Current, 80s, chart. This isn't the case. Don't get me wrong- I danced, but I jig in shops to music. I love my music but it left me feeling a bit 'meh'. It is background music for a slightly pretentious get together. Great for corporal or for 'peacocking'.  We felt a bit squished in our area and as for the view I rarely got outside as I was mingling with the girls- so don't get hung up on the view if you are considering this for a hardcore night partying. View would be amazing for quiet drinks with a couple of girls, or again, corporate. The waiting staff were nowhere to be seen and the staff in general need to learn how to smile. They seem bored and generally pissed off and snooty. When I'm paying \u00a3900 for 3 hours when half my girls are on water because they are new mummies or athletes I expect to feel quite special.  When they tried to charge me an extra \u00a3150 service charge when my bill was actually \u00a3600 but I still had to pay \u00a3900 ( min spend) I wasn't impressed.  Basically a fab place for lunch or corporate drinks or just a couple of girls after a show. Just don't bother booking a table. The interior is stylish. The atmosphere slightly pretentious which is great for the right occasion. It just left me a bit cold. The girls said they would go again and they loved the views.

Being met on the door by a lady with a clip board may look all very important but really isn't necessary. We were shown our table. How the waiters and waitresses work here amazes me - it's so dark you can't see what you are doing - you can't see the menus or the prices (perhaps that is a ruse!) The prices naturally are quite high but I do agree that the views are very good indeed and under the heaters it was quite warm bearing in mind it was a November evening. Only one half of the exterior walkway was open due to some work being done but there was plenty of room out there for you to have a walk around. There are small padded seats on the floor mixed in with the chairs which were actually quite easy to miss and trip over and the waitress had to keep pushing them out of the way when she wanted to top our glasses up. The music was also quite loud so we all had quite hoarse throats this morning due to us having to shout most of the evening. All in all it's a nice ambience with spectacular views. I have to agree with the earlier advisor who mentioned the ladies toilets - it was like going into the mirror maze in a fairground - fumbling around trying to find your way through shiny doors was enough of a problem completely sober - thankfully the drinks were too expensive to get drunk.

My boyfriend went to speak to the GM at the Melia Hotel to let him know what had happened and he said he was aware of the problems customers had but said there was nothing he could do as they only rented the space and were not linked in any other way (interesting how when you google Radio Bar it comes up with Melia.com though!!).

It's just London and it;s just a bar - get over yourselves. We sure did - straight across to One Aldwych across the street for great service and great cocktails. And to tell you the truth, I've been to the foyer bar in the ME London and it was hideous. I think I have been spared the same experience at the Radio Roof Top Bar. Many other reviers clearly agree.

The atmosphere is great because it\u2019s in between a club and a bar. I am now definitely a fan of Radio. I had a reservation for 8 people and was given a nice table near the window and the bar. The hostess (wish I could remember her name) was very cheerful and friendly. Our waitress, Coco, was very friendly and very efficient. She took care of us the whole evening and often approached us to find out if everything was fine. We rarely had to serve ourselves drinks from the bottles, as she anticipated our needs. Having worked for several five star hotels in Switzerland and London, I can say that I was very impressed by the level of service received at Radio. Also, the view from the bar is breath taking. You can see many attractions such as the London Eye or the Shard from the bar. Unfortunately, it was raining that day so we couldn\u2019t fully take advantage of the terrace. The outdoor area is very nice and even has heaters for people who want to smoke or just chat outside.

I worked in hospitality for 3 years and so I have an understanding of good customer service. When your bouncers, bar manager, floor staff and girl managing the lift to the bar all are so far stuck up there own backsides that they forget what manners and basic courtesy are, you've got a serious problem on your hands. I watched as a guy and girl on reception chatted to each other all the time and did not once greet guests as they came out of the lift. I get the feeling the staff that work there are only there to say they \"work\" at Radio Bar. I don't think they are interested in making sure their customers have a pleasant experience.

This led her straight back to the same place. Hysterical. There are tons of staff but mostly standing around chatting in groups. The real gripe was when I paid. I added a tip onto the credit card when prompted by the machine but service had already been added to the bill. I felt that this was an attempt to screw more money out of the customers.

I was told by a young lady that to secure a table they had a minimum spend policy of \u00a350 per head but I could just turn up on the day and see if they had tables available. Decided to go this route. We turned up after the theatre and wanted to head for the Terrace Bar to eat - on previous occasions when we have visited the Terrace Bar we are escorted from the main hotel lifts to the Bar. On this occasion we were asked (whilst at the lifts) if we were residents - when we said we were not they lady said in that case would we go out of the hotel turn right and the entrance we needed was there. So we did this and found the \"street\" entrance at which were another lady and a security guy and not one person in the line. So we tried again - I said we wanted to have dinner for the 5 of us and we had been asked by the hotel to come to this entrance. We were advised by a rather rude young lady that there were no outside tables available - so I asked if there were any inside tables....she said she didn't know and why don't we go up and check it out. By this time it was all becoming rather annoying and so I suggested that perhaps they could communicate with the Terrace Bar and ask them. I am not kidding you when I tell you that the young lady on the door raised her eyes heavenwards and \"tutted\"!!!! Anyway, there was a table available so we were finally \"let in\" and we walked around the corner to find ourselves back at the same lift we had just left before - when I complained to the same young lady about how stupid this was she had to dissemble and say it was \"Company Policy\". All this before we have even set foot in the bar!! Arriving in the bar we find not only table available inside but also on the terrace! We order drinks and food \"bites\" from a not very extensive bar menu - the menu contains perhaps 10 different options - after we ordered our waitress came back and told us that they had run out of 4 of the 10 items on the menu and the wine we had ordered as well!! Having nearly lost the will to live just to get up there we persevered and stayed. We were rewarded by a great sun-set and the food that did turn up was fine. This is a place that has become a victim of its own success and really really needs the Management to wake up and realise how easily they will destroy good-will. London is a City with many many great Hotels and One The Aldwych (right next door) is one of them. I think that they will sleep easily at night (except of course they wont be complacent!).

After reading some reviews I saw that some people were having trouble getting in under 21, so while I was on the phone I asked if it was over 21s for this particular night and was told no and I also checked on their website, where it says nothing about an age restriction. I then called again the week on my birthday to confirm the table and to also move the table time back half an hour. Which was all confirmed and the woman on the phone appeared to be very helpful.  My friends and I then turned up the bar at the time our table was booked for, to then be rudely asked our age by a doorman and a woman with no sort of welcome. She then told us that that night was over 21s, to which I told her I had a table booked and I should not of been allowed to book a table as the woman on the phone knew my age. She then took a quick glance at her reservation list and told us there was no reservation in my name. I tried to explain my situation that I had called several times and had had my table confirmed and checked that it wasn\u2019t over 21s. I told her what I had been told about the \u00a3100 minimum spend for the table, to which she told me that was incorrect and that it was \u00a3100 minimum per head. I don't know whether she was lying on the night but I know for sure that I was told it was per table as I had checked it several times. She asked me for proof of my reservation and told me that I should of had an e-mail confirmation, I remembered giving the woman on the phone my contact details but I hadn't received any sort of confirmation. Which was not my fault if I didn\u2019t receive one. She was very rude and not the least bit understanding or willing to help. She was implying I was a liar. I asked to speak to the manager to try to solve the problem, to which she told me she was the door manager and her name was Shannon. I made sure I asked for her name so I could make an accurate complaint. The man on the door remained quiet the whole time so I can't say I have an opinion on him.  After unsuccessfully trying to reach an understanding with Shannon we just decided to walk away.

We went to speak to them and found out they were all 22+ and had also made a reservation but were turned away and told that there was no reservation in their name. I think this bar chooses on the door who they want in there and who they think are going to spend the most money. Even though we had booked a table we weren't going to be let in because we were a group of young adults. Awful door staff, will be making sure I tell a lot of people not to go here.

We got a seat at the bar and enjoyed a well mixed dry martini, the bar was buzzing with good music and a great crowd. we stayed twice as long as we had intended and really enjoyed it. We went for a repeat on Saturday about the same time. We did manage to get a seat but not at the bar, once again the drinks and service were good, however, the music was decidely exclusionary. Club volume drum and base is not intended to attract a mixed crowd (hotel guests) at that early stage of an evening. The bar was full and no doubt the very young crowd were enjoying it but we felt the DJ policy was intended to attract a very limited clientele, which did not include us, c'est la vie.

And in truth, I would advise anyone ever thinking of going anywhere near this awful bar to think again. We visited as part of a birthday celebration for a few pre-dinner cocktails. However even getting up to the bar was problematic (the hotel has bizarre rules about which door you must enter the hotel from in order to be allowed to use the lift to the rooftop bar). So we entered the hotel only to be greeted by a stone-faced member of staff who told us to go back outside, turn right, then right, then enter by another door. We did all of this only to follow a maze if hallways leading to exactly the same lift and stone-faced lift operator. Bizarre and unnecessary especially as it was 7pm and there was no queue at all. Other customers had been forced to do the same thing and we're equally confused. Eventually we made it up to the bar - awful decor (think Russian living in Chelsea) - lots of white leather. Bit like an outdated 80's George Michael Video. As a result all the customers and staff seemed decked out in silk shirts and pointy shiny shoes. It was about as far away from stylish has you can imagine. The only thing to justify the prices was the view (but there are plenty of fab views from bars across London). Took an age to get served (it is table service) and the staff were inept, unfriendly and rude - so we decided we would rather give our money and time to a bar which wanted to actually have us there. Never. Ever. Go anywhere near this bar. I can't caution against it enough.", "date_of_review": "29 September 2013"}

Myself and my date turned up about 6pm on a very hot Thursday (the last sunny day of summer) and yes there was a queue outside but we waited patiently, like everybody else and was soon upstairs in no time. The thing i noticed was that although there was a queue downstairs it wasnt that busy upstairs- but i liked this. It meant it was easy to get a drink, you wasnt getting bumped all over the place and it added to the relaxing but vibrant atmosphere of the bar. The view is amazing and the bar itself looks very cool and upmarket and wanting to sit outside we noticed that all the tables seemed to be reserved however, on speaking to one of the hostesses, she quite happily directed us to a table where we could sit until the reserve party turned up. 3 hours, numerous drinks and some food later, the party did turn up and the hostess actually apologised to us for asking us to move. However, she then took us to another table and said we could sit there. Exceptional customer service seeing as we hadnt booked a table. I did not encounter any rude bar staff or waitresses infact i found them to be polite, helpful and very efficient and they kept the drinks coming. The prices are very competitive with the majority of other bars in London and as the night went on the atmosphere became more lively as the dj turned the volume up and the sun and the lights went down over London. All in all i thoroughly recommend going to this bar, the view alone is worth while but i genuinely did not encounter any negative aspects at all. If you go with an open mind knowing you are getting a great view in a very upmarket, classy bar with a great atmosphere this is the place to go.

Tried to book a table but got told that we cant book, it is walk in, just turn up.... We decided we would \"just turn up\" before our trip to the theatre on a Monday evening for a cocktail and a bit of food. The doorman reluctantly let us up but when we said we had another couple joining us in about 20 mins, he shrugged and said he couldn't guarantee they would be let in. On the way up, you meet at least 4 more members of staff at various \"check points\" and they all the ask the same question \"do you have a reservation?\" um, no, we were told you cant book? then you get all that \"oh....ok\" and the sucking in of breath like you are really putting them out. Once up on the roof, it wasn't busy, but we couldn't get a table as the majority of them were reserved.... odd, considering you cant book? The bar itself is very small but very well done, it is beautiful. The view is really nice too (although, Madison's for me is nicer. St Paul's Cathedral is so beautiful) We asked the waitress if we can sit on a table that was reserved from 7pm onwards as we would have gone by then and she said yes. We sat down and got moved almost immediately. The 2nd table was more successful and we had 2 spare spaces for the rest of our party. The drinks were nice and actually, our waitress was really helpful and nice and we ordered a few plates of tapas and again, this was pleasant enough. Our friends arrived and had to called us as the doorman wasn't letting them in. A total of 3 people had come up after us but the doorman was saying they were full. Eventually our waitress had a word with the staff downstairs as we did have 2 seats waiting for them and they were let up (this whole thing took about 15 minutes). The experience by now had been ruined as they felt very unwanted and the lady we were with felt it was because she wasn't dressed right (even though she looked beautiful) and she wasn't feeling very comfortable. We paid the bill and left vowing never to return.  My feelings are that this is a very pretentious bar and you have to look a certain way or have more money than sense to be \"let in\". I have a friend that went on a work night out and she said the clientele was awful... Traders and bankers buying magnums of champagne that light up so everyone can see who is flashing the cash... she left after one drink. The staff need to go on an English course and a Customer Service course. You can get away with being arrogant and rude to your customers whilst you are new and fresh but once people are bored and the next \"new place to be\" opens up, this place will be empty and have a bad reputation. It is bad enough that tourists get treated like this is normal in London but as a local, I think it is disgusting. Luckily, there are plenty of much nicer, friendlier, cheaper and easier to visit roof top bars in London. In a years time (maybe even less) this will be full of young City boys drinking their weight in Jaegermeister and throwing up in the plants and prostitutes looking for easy money while the \"Made in Chelsea\" lot pose for selfies  Its a shame as this could have been great.

Myself and my wife love STK and the Italian restaurant in ME hotel but Radio is an absolute disgrace. My sister in law was admitted without question (although not without obvious inspection) by the bouncers (at about 1500hrs on a Saturday afternoon). My eight months pregnant wife (who is beautiful - but frankly this isn't the point) was proclaimed to be a \"school-boy error\" as she followed on her sister's coat-tails. Had I known at the time that that comment had been made I would, frankly, have left immediately but, my wife being more demure than the bouncers, did not tell me that this had been said. Our other guests (who were not within the age profile evidently prefered by those on the door) were refused entry until my sister in law went back downstairs to plead their case. When we did eventually get a table the staff were mediocre at best. However by that time I had been made aware of the ordeal that my wife and our other guests had been put through in order to gain admission to the bar. As a result I was, to be entirely honest, fuming. However having been almost refused admission and having spent over \u00a3200 on what was a fairly mediocre magnum of champagne (the \"best value\" way of buying bubbly for more than 6 people) I resolved never to return to this establishment ever again.  My issue with this place is not so much that it is stupidly expensive (although it is) nor that the people who seem to populate it are carbon copies of each other (although they are) but that the bouncers and those who work there appear to consider that unless you are straight out of an Abercrombie & Fitch or Kooples advert, you are not worthy to grace their bar. This is an absolutely disgusting approach to running a drinking establishment.  Yes; the view is great. If you have no self respect by all means go there to drink. If you have even a modicum of decency as a human being however please give your money to a company that will not charge you six times the retail price of your drink and where they will treat you as something other than sub-human if you just so happen to not fit the management's / bouncers' vision of perfection. There are, quite frankly, much more pleasant roof top venues in which to spend an afternoon (Cod d'Argent in the City for example) where you will not be made to spend a fortune and won't be made to feel like scum if you dare to have a BMI that is not on the dangerously low side. However if you genuinely think that you would fit right in in the cast of \"Made in Chelsea\" (and would like to) then this is the place for you. However, if you have earned your own money and would rather use it somewhere worthwhile I would implore you not to waste it at this place.  I entirely appreciate that having read this review you, dear reader, will have formed the view that the writer is somewhat embittered by this particular experience and will have concluded that I am ugly and fat and annoyed by that fact as well as my treatment in this bar. You will of course be completely correct but I do subscribe to the (old fashioned) view that my money is as good as anyone elses and that I should be permitted to spend it whereever I chose without being made to feel bad about it. If being made to feel less than human by a group of uber trendy people is fine by you (or if you'll fit right in) then I wish you very many happy times at this bar.

WHAT AN ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT is all I can say, I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy. The staff have no interest in helping or being polite. We were told we were not allowed to go outside and if we did we had to be gone by 6pm (it only gave us just over 30 minutes) so we decided to sit inside. After asking two waitresses if we could order drinks and approx 7 of them standing around a till point chatting, chewing gum and laughing, one eventually came to take our order. When we finally received the drinks we had been seated for over 25 minutes by this time - so please don't expect service to be quick! The atmosphere was awful, it felt like we were being a nuisance to the staff who couldn't be bothered to serve us, smile at us or even be there in general. One last point, a female member of the bar staff, whilst mixing the drinks used a straw to test the drink and adjust accordingly, and then licked it as a tester. Am I not right in thinking, that she should have been trained to a higher standard in the art of making cocktails?   The hotel itself is indeed a well presented modern one, however the majority of the members of staff let this hotel chain down, with what can only be described as less than professional attitude.  Once I came home after feeling very deflated I decided to air my views with the hotel only to find that there is no complaints section or even \"contact us\" page on their website......I wonder why!

I'm lucky enough to \"know-someone-who-knows-someone\" and I didn't need to wait at all, but I also know my bars so I have to agree that the staff are generally average (a few are apparently more concerned with being cool than being efficient), and although the drinks are reasonably good in a 90s \"been done before\" way, there's nothing special about the bar, other than the view, which is without a doubt the only reason to visit.  My tip is to dress-up to avoid the chance of being sidelined at the rope, arrive early, certainly before the braying idiots get there, and if you are going to go through all the hassle, go on a Thursday when there's a DJ. I've read what Ian D the Bar manager has replied to many and he has my sympathies, but the essence of any bar, indeed any business is it's people, and the staff are generally not worthy of the venue, Ian will be a seasoned bar manager so he almost certainly is aware of the shortcomings, but it's hard to change staff in your busiest period- I'm sure some butts have been kicked though.  As far as the policies on entry, they make sense, but it does grate when you know that private members \"concierge\" companies can get their members in at very short notice with no queuing, and the capacity never seems to cause their members to wait. Funny that. (Also, if a bar is to allow men to spend ages in cubicles \"powdering their noses\", maybe a few more loos would be useful, or some cubicles with just glass shelves).  Finally, as far as I know the bar is operated by another company, not the hotel, so maybe there is some dis-connect between the two that causes issues? All in all, nice views of the greatest city in the world, maybe it will get better as time goes on, or maybe not, in which case the next wave of great bars will inevitably take over and it should be easy enough to get in.", "date_of_review": "16 August 2013"}

My friends had been there for few hours already and I was joining them after work. I was told by the host/receptionist with a clip board in hand that I had to queue for 40 minutes in order to join my friends,as the bar had reach the maximum capacity and there was nothing he could do. The only alternative was to queue and wait for my turn.  I then called my friend upstairs and explain the situation, I was told by my friends that they were sitting on a table of 4 with 2 free chairs, the host/receptionist still didn\u2019t want to know about it.  Then my friend came to pick me up from the bar and we had the same kind of arrogant and non helpfull attitude.  He was adamant I would not go upstairs due to the capacity , even thou there were free sitting.   After 10 minutes of debating and arguing a security guard got involve (which I thought I was going to be escorted out) but he kindly escorted me to the bar.  He defused the situation in no time, I must say his professionalism was excellent.  Thankfully the staff at the bar and waitresses were very friendly and did an excellent job.

I had read the numerous bad reviews, mostly from people who failed to get entry, and I wondered what type of experience I would have, as apparently even hotel guests had been refused access on occasions! We decided to go at around 5:30pm, and as we approached the bouncer, all we were asked was whether we were residents of the hotel, and upon confirming this we were immediately sent up. As the lift opened on the 10th floor, we were instantly blown away by the venue. It was achingly cool in design. There was a reasonably large indoor area, in a triangular shape with a bar in the middle of the room. This was surrounded by a spacious outdoor area with great views over London. On this particular day, it was quite cloudy and windy, which resulted in most people occupying the indoor area. A DJ was playing house music (apparently the DJ is present on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays). Cocktails were priced at around \u00a312, which is reasonable for this type of venue. Various nibbles are available as well, which were surprisingly tasty (we had the mini-burgers, beef satay and monkfish tempura). I noted that bottle prices were slightly cheaper than what you would pay at certain nightclubs (but not by too much). The atmosphere was buzzing, and some people had clearly been there for a number of hours already. What was surprisingly was how dressed up people were, given that it was still daylight outside. Several of them probably intended to stay there until the early hours! The bar was crowded, but not too crowded, which is quite a rarity in London, especially for a rooftop bar. We managed to find a small sofa for two people. Larger tables were all \u2018reserved\u2019, but it did appear that many people were sitting here without reservations, and some of them were subsequently asked to move away. We were here for about 2 hours, and service was good throughout. There was never a long wait at the bar, and I was always greeted with a smile.

So we finally got to see what all the fuss is about and tbh i can confirm that's just what it is...fuss!

In one of the booths that could have seated 6-8 people were a couple who said they were just leaving, so we sat and ordered a bottle of wine (\u00a338 + 12.5% service, for a branded wine that is frequently have on offer at local supermarket to \u00a35.99) We received our wine, and was then told by a young woman that this area was reserved for people on their way up in the lift, and we could have a sofa inside.

Now, after reading other reviews, I wonder whether we should have been 'allowed up' in the first place, and if we were just the wrong sort of customers to be sitting on their terrace.

After waiting patiently for another 10 minutes, we were advised by the All Important 'Woman-with'-clipboard' named Monika to wait in the downstairs bar and she would collect us when a table became available. We questioned this as it didn't make any sense. We also questioned why, when we had called to make a booking, to be told 'We don't take bookings' followed by 'We're fully booked but you can try a walk in.' WTF?! By this time, we were gasping so after a bottle of Prosecco and some tapas, my friend ventured out to talk to Woman with Clipboard. When asked why the people behind us had mysteriously been whisked up to the bar while we were left to rot in the downstairs bar, she had no answer. A saner person may have gathered their dignity and accepted that for some unknown reason (we are all smart, professional, young women who frequent the these types of bars and clubs most weekends.) After all, we should naturally be disinclined to provide profits when delivered with such disappointing behaviour of the door staff.

With regards to the Radio Rooftop Bar I sadly have to agree with only 50% of the comments simply because after 2 & \u00bd hour queue (FACT) we were denied the view of this \u2018sleek, glammed-up, \u2018Sex and the City\u2019 destination\u2019. I have now learnt that \u2018bar at full capacity\u2019 is a better word to turn the \u2018unwanted\u2019 away \u2013 how else would you explain the door staff still letting friends and \u2018fabulous people\u2019 jumping a queue of mostly tired and yet still smiling \u2018commoners\u2019? After 1 and \u00bd hour wait, my friend and I were next in line to become fashionable immortals and finally join the gods sipping cocktails in this brand new Olympus of Aldwich. One more hour went by and not a sign, nor a word, or even eye contact from the tall lady at the door holding the clipboard and sharing jokes with her colleagues. She also decided that it was absolutely acceptable to turn her back to us for most of the time and leave us to wonder whether she would ever unlock the cord between us and the most pretentious entrance to a bar I have ever come across in my life. The rest of the experience you can gather from other people that have actually managed to cross that line\u2026\u2026alas I was not one of the lucky immortals to be chosen to grace this current bastion of coolness. It is now my mission to make sure that my \u2013dreadful- experience of the Radio Rooftop Bar \u2018entrance\u2019 is shared with everyone I know. Places like this kill the spirit of London, a city where the very diversity of its people creates the exceptional experience that is London\u2026Do the \u2018only-fabulous ghettos\u2019 have a place in this?

I have not done this lightly as I know this website attracts a lot of attention, but I was really shocked by their attitude and the minimum spend thresholds. Will be interested if I receive any response as the management seem to be very selective in which reviews they reply to. Tried a walk-in (we were a group of 2 females in our 40s) to this London bar last week at around 5.00 pm. Got through the main door OK to be met by the leggy blond with the clipboard at the lift who said they were full and suggested booking in advance for another evening. (We had spied the rooftop from the river and it frankly didn't look that packed to me so maybe we just didn't look 'trendy' enough). No worries, we left and went to another (more upmarket) bar in the same locale. So I then tried to book another evening that week. Firstly the website does not show the correct number to book the bar - you have to ring a separate number from the hotel number apparently. When I located the correct number I called and the answer message (the call had been answered so I was paying for the call) informed me I was fifth in the queue (this was at 9.30 am) and would be answered in, I recall, 5 minutes. Some 15-20 minutes later my call was answered. They could only accommodate my booking at a time that did not suit us and informed me that to book early in the day you have to agree to a minimum spend per person of \u00a360 and later in the evening a pre-booking incurs a minimum spend of \u00a3100 per person and the only way to not incur this minimum spend threshold is to be a walk-in. I have absolutely no issue with paying for good service and a nice ambience but that is frankly outrageous given that at other, more exclusive, venues, (in the UK and abroad) it does not cost that much for a couple of cocktails. If the management of this establishent think I (or others it seems from the reviews) are going to take a taxi/walk/tube/bus over to their bar on the off-chance they have walk-in availability they must be kidding themselves. I can only assume they have a regular clientele of 'cool kids' who are willing to be royally ripped off. I am not, and will not be, one of them.", "date_of_review": "28 July 2013"}

The door staff, with clipboards, pointed me to the downstairs bar. But I was meeting family at the rooftop... Are they there yet, clipboard asked. No, I said, so again she pointed me firmly to the bar with a 'try again later'. Well I freshened up in the loos, stuck my heels on, ouch, and waited with a glass of wine. Once family arrived - younger, cooler generation - we were allowed upstairs at which point I really couldn't be bothered any more. Yes, it is nice on the rooftop, and yes the views are stunning. The drink prices are as you would expect - \u00a38 glass of wine, \u00a311 cocktail - but my bar snack was awful. The cheese sauce on the macaroni had split. The chips were a la McDonalds. The Mai Tai was nice. Serving staff were very helpful, unlike the clipboards. Cool looking blokes in suits with earphones were openly sneering of people.  The clientele are also as you would expect, stylish in the way of city workers and sloanes. There were a couple of groups of girls on what looked like the start of big nights out.  As I said, not a place I would choose to go, but I do expect to be made to feel welcome and at ease when I visit establishments and pay good prices or food and drink. I wasn't.

I decided to take some friends and 2 clients (an all male party of 6). The bookings were made for 6 people, minimum \u00a3600 spend, 9pm table, under the name of Staples. My guests and clients arrived promptly, sober and easliy meeting any dress code laid down by the bar, however upon our arrival, we were denied entrance, given the party was all male ??, nowhere does it state that all male parties will be declined access, not on the booking confirmation or when reserving the table.I'm not going to rant about the lady on the door (Monika), in fairness she called the manager (Brendon) at our request. he also stated that there needs to be a balance of women and men in the bar, but surely this has to be stipulated upon booking ??? we had some female friends in the area and agreed with the manager, if we brought our female friends along then we could get gain entry. After numerous phone calls and the expense of a taxi we finally got our additional female guests (7 of them) to the Radio Bar, now there is a total of 13 people, yet again we present ourselves to the entrance, yet again meeting the criteria set by the management. the management would then allow us access, based on we pay \u00a31500 for the party, yet previously it was \u00a3100 per person and we had 13 guests = \u00a31300. I tried to explain this in a civil, sober and diplomatic manner to the lady on the door, but was told, her manager (Brendon) had now set this new cost and was not offering a reason for this revised figure. Ultimatley the cost of enjoying a few hours in a relaxed enviroment was turning into a costly experience. Hence we had to leave due to the cost.  This totaly ruined everybodies night and caused me embarressment in front of my friends and clients too. Thanks for ruining what was planned as a really good night and constantly moving the goal post i.e an all male party and then raising the entrance fee.

You wouldn't walk into the Ritz for afternoon tea and be surprised if they couldn't seat you immediately! The downstairs staff do control how many people are on the roof to make sure when you're up there it's a really pleasant experience, rather than other rooftops, where it's five people deep at the bar - like the terrace at Aqua Kyoto now everyone goes. Here it's ultra-civilised and it only takes a couple of minutes to get served. I had a birthday party here in one of the cabanas and my friends agreed that it's absolutely awesome - great service, cool views over Covent Garden, to Somerset House and the river, and when the sun goes down the music's turned up as there's a great DJ. They send food up from STK on the ground floor, which is great.  I've been back a couple of times since, with clients and on a date, and because I've booked, have walked to the front of the queue and straight up....

Fast forward to 19 July 2013 - i finally had the time to come and check out the rooftop bar (already reviewed and been to Cuccina) I arrived at 5.50 and immediately the tall, dark haired lady at the door told me and my friend (we are two girls) that it was reservation only and that she could not let us in. We hung around a little and noticed she more or less said the same to everyone BUT the odd few people she let in.  We went into the hotel to figure out what to do where to go and bumped into a lovely, pleasant and very friendly girl called Tasha who advised us to go back out and try again which we did and this time the tall, dark haired lady allowed us in - even though it was 30 minutes later....yes it was a little hassle getting in but yes it was also worth it but not worth it if its too stressful. One thing management should realise is that people revolve their day around arranging to go to venues like this which are few and far between in london and if you can't cater for first come first served (which was what isabel told me on email via the reservations email) what's the point in coming??!!  But the ppl inside the venue (ie the customers) were very friendly, the vibe was great and it's a nice older, sophisticated crowd and it should stay like this. It was not pretentious at all - even the security guards upstairs and bar staff were nice. I bumped into Tasha again and had to approach her and just thank her for her kind words and just being so bloody down to earth - makes a pleasant change. Since my visit i have spoken to my sister who has also been and said Tasha was very nice and pleasant to her and her work colleagues when they went.

We were told about the minimum spend per person of \u00a3 100, prices to keep riff-raffs at bay, so we thought. Our reservation was confirmed by email promptly and I noticed, dress code: smart /casual. We arrived the next day at 8:45pm, the girl at reception checked our names on the list and we were directed to the Express elevator to rooftop bar. (though our reservation was during a week day, I could not but notice that there were very few reservations on the list). Our reservation was checked again by another beautiful long legged blond and we were taken to our table. The bar and terrace was full people, lounge music not too over powering. As we were seated, they made us give our credit card to open the TAB and signed a white envelop containing the credit card confirming that we would spend at least \u00a3 400. We sat down, looked at the menu and noticed that the drinks and food are reasonably priced, we ordered a bottle of champagne and a selection of \"tapas\", all delicious, small portions. I quickly realised that there is no way, a normal person, would spend \u00a3 100 on food and drinks unless you are driving home. We started people watching, a great place to do it, and here comes the big disappointment. Sadly this bar, with the most amazing views of London, is not the place to bring your date.

Once at the lifts we were confronted with a young man with walkie talkie and clip board (very officious looking) who told us that he couldn't let us up yet but that if we waited in the lobby bar for 20 minutes he would let us up by 5.05 or 5.10pm. This in itself didn't seem to be a problem to us - we were willing to wait 20 minutes. We ordered a bottle of bubbles from the lobby bar on the understanding that we would be shown up to the rooftop bar shortly. When 20 then 30 then 40 minutes had passed we asked to go up to the roof and were told that we wouldn't be able to go up, possibly until 8.30pm! We asked to see management at this point, who incidentally, never showed up. Having given them an ultimatum to either get us the management, get us on to the roof or give us our bottle of fizz for free so we could go elsewhere they chose the latter. Alejandro on the lobby bar tried very hard to fix the situation which we appreciated but when he was unable to get the management to speak to us we felt that we were being played a little.

When summer finally arrived this week I asked a friend of mine (in her 30s) if she could recommend somewhere serving cocktails with an outside area and she suggested the Radio Rooftop bar for its spectacular views. I looked at the website and couldn't find any details about how to book, apart from booking a hotel room - but I wasn't worried as the website also says walk-in customers are welcome. We arrived at 5pm on a Thursday evening and went into the ME hotel where we were advised that we needed to go to an outside door to gain admission. The chap who told us where to go said they had only just re-opened the bar so we didn't think there would be a problem getting in. At the door there was a small queue - about 5 parties of two to four people ahead of us. A longer queue soon formed behind us. Some people who went straight to the front of the queue were being let in, presumably because they had made reservations. Fair enough. When after about 15 minutes the queue hadn't moved I went to the front of the queue to ask how long we might have to wait for entry. The young woman at the door told me she couldn't say - it depended on how many pre-booked people arrived. She didn't give any indication that we wouldn't be able to get in so I rejoined my friend in the queue. As it was a nice sunny evening we decided to stay and wait.. Another 15 minutes passed and two parties ahead of us finally gained entry leaving two young girls ahead of us, ourselves and another woman in her 60s with ?her daughter. There were by now maybe twenty plus people in the queue behind us. I guess the six of us were a bit underdressed compared to other people gaining entry to the bar (think Made in Chelsea and you'll get the general idea) But we were all respectably dressed, eg one in a summer dress, me in a summer skirt and camisole, no jeans or shorts). At that point the young man on the door looked the six of us up and down (not in a good way) and told us that the waiting time would now be an hour to an hour and half. At that point two people came out of the building so the lady behind us asked if that didn't mean that the two girls at the front could go in. 'NO' came the reply, the bouncers upstairs have advised that the bar is over capacity. We thought it strange since very few people had gone in while we'd been waiting, but decided to accept what they said and wait a bit longer. The two girls ahead of us and the lady and daughter behind us finally gave up. At which point the male receptionist came back to us (we were now at the front of the queue) and said 'I admire your persistence but you are going to have to wait an hour and a half' We still decided to wait until ten minutes later he approached us again and said he'd be grateful if we'd step aside from the queue. My friend asked politely if that meant he didn't want us in the bar. He simply said, No, I'm just asking you to step aside from the queue. He didn't ask any of the now 30 plus people behind us to do the same. So, yes we finally got the message we weren't welcome and left. Three minutes later we turned back to see the people who'd been queuing behind us being let in. I didn't mention at the beginning of this review that my friend and I are in our 50s, did I? Though I can only assume that's the reason we weren't let in. That and the fact that we weren't wearing the glamorous outfits being worn by some, but by no means all of the customers who successfully got in to the bar. Sorry, but I cant find a dress code or any age restrictions on the website. We wouldn't have minded quite so much if the door staff hadn't let us wait nearly an hour before informing us we weren't welcome. I have never been humiliated like this in my whole life (despite having the audacity to reach 50 and assume I can still have a night out!). And I have been led to believe that its illegal in this country to discriminate on the basis of age. So I do hope all you trendy young things who manage to get in to the Rooftop bar have a lovely evening. But before you do, maybe you'd like to consider if you'd like your mother, aunt or older friend to be treated like this? Our evening was ruined, not because we didn't get in but because we were made to feel humiliated and worthless. So I hope this review may help other people avoid being treated in a similar fashion.

When I entered through the inauspicious door with the name \u201cRadio\u201d on it, there were no signs but I managed to find my way to the lifts where some other people were waiting too. We all boarded a lift with the intention of going to the bar on to the 10th floor, only to find out that we could not actually access the 10th floor so we were all send back down. We saw a hotel staff member who said the \u201cshould be a host\u201d downstairs but there wasn\u2019t. The other guests and I decided to walk to the hotel reception, where we were told the hotel does not operate the bar and there \u201cshould be a host somewhere near the lifts\u201d. No sign of a host. Having agreed to meet a friend there, I and some other guests joined a few other people, who had been waiting even longer, at the lift bank. All in all there must have been some 15 of us, in various different groups, and no host in sight. Occasionally hotel staff took pity on us and tried to locate the host for us but to no avail. In the mean time the group kept swelling to about 20 people waiting to access the bar. Not only incredibly annoying for people like me who agree to meet friends up on the terrace (one guy said his friends were already up there) but also a huge loss of income for the operators of the bar on a sunny afternoon. Finally a very snooty girl called Sasha with a clipboard made an appearance. No apologies were offered, she did not seem to see any problem with the crowd in front of her. In addition, if your name was not on the clipboard, that meant no reservation, which meant no access. No apologies for the confusion, the wait, the frustration, the misunderstanding or any form of consolation whatsoever. Just rude short answers. At least 20 people who spent between 15 and 30 minutes waiting in vain were sent away without any form of apology and still at a loss to understand what just happened and why.

We thought we\u2019d go somewhere special on a Friday night for reunion drinks, and decided to check out Radio Rooftop Bar for the views. We were a group of 5. My friend and husband got there early at 5:15pm and got us a table big enough to sit 6 people. I arrived at 6:20pm, and was told in a very stuck up manner by this now notorious lady with the clip board that they were \u2018full to capacity\u2019, it was a one in one out policy, and had to form an imaginary \u2018queue\u2019 of just myself. I told her my friends were upstairs already and had a table with empty seat, but her reply was she couldn\u2019t do anything, they were definitely full and she couldn\u2019t tell me how long the wait could be...maybe an hour, two hours, she doesn\u2019t know. After a few frantic phone calls to my friends waiting upstairs (who confirmed the bar was in fact quite empty) they said they will try to talk to the waiters and hosts upstairs to see if they could get me up. Waiting, I watched her turn away people with the same response, while sniggering and smirking to her co-worker \u2013 another pole up the behind type guy who seemed more interested in his hair and mobile phone . A group of about 6 came along, turned away as they had no booking, but were let up when they said they knew so-and-so (confirmed by a phone call, in front of all the people who were now queued up behind me). Various other friends with the door staff were also let up without any difficulty. By now there were a few people like me waiting downstairs who had friends they were meeting were upstairs with a table. This included a lady who was meeting a business client waiting upstairs, and was pleading with the door lady to no avail. All this happening while groups of people were leaving from the bar upstairs, so you wonder if the one in-one out policy really applies. Finally, after waiting over 40 mins, the group of people who had friends already upstairs waiting were let in by the door lady, without much of an acknowledgement, eye contact, or an apology, beside a gesture of the finger motioning us in. What a privilege. Sure enough, once upstairs, the bar was half empty. Now waiting to get served by the various waitresses milling around, my friend went to the bar hoping to get faster service and was slapped with 12.5% \u2018service charge\u2019 for the bar tender to pass over a bottle of wine and 3 glasses.  My 2 friends who came shortly afterwards were treated with the same rudeness and contempt. When asking if one of us could go down and get them, the curt reply was , \u2018you might not get back up\u2019. I can honestly say this has been the most ridiculous and pretentious bar I have ever encountered. The arrogance, rudeness and bad attitude of the door staff and hosts, coupled with the incompetence of the waitresses who had no idea of what they were doing were astounding. After reading the reviews, it seems like my experience is quite the norm here. You\u2019d think the management would get a clue and address issues of customer service and staff training. Shame really, the views are indeed spectacular. But no view is good enough, in my opinion, for an establishment to treat their paying customers with such contempt. Save your precious time, hard earned money and take your business someplace else where your custom is deserved and valued.", "date_of_review": "11 July 2013"}

The bar itself is still lovely and the staff in the bar are lovely but the door staff seemed very rude. They asked two older ladies to leave the queue for no good reason and kept suggesting people who did not have a reservation did not bother queuing. The strange thing was that upstairs, the bar seemed half empty.

A total disgrace. As she and others have remarked it is totally unclear as to whether you should make a reservation or not, even if you only want to come for a drink at 4.30pm like I did. To be on the safe side, I did email at around 12pm but never got a reply or even anybody acknowledging my email. When I entered through the inauspicious door with the name \u201cRadio\u201d on it, there were no signs but I managed to find my way to the lifts where some other people were waiting too. We all boarded a lift with the intention of going to the bar on to the 10th floor, only to find out that we could not actually access the 10th floor so we were all send back down. We saw a hotel staff member who said the \u201cshould be a host\u201d downstairs but there wasn\u2019t. The other guests and I decided to walk to the hotel reception, where we were told the hotel does not operate the bar and there \u201cshould be a host somewhere near the lifts\u201d. No sign of a host.Having agreed to meet a friend there, I and some other guests joined a few other people, who had been waiting even longer, at the lift bank. All in all there must have been some 15 of us, in various different groups, and no host in sight. Occasionally hotel staff took pity on us and tried to locate the host for us but to no avail. In the mean time the group kept swelling to about 20 people waiting to access the bar. Not only incredibly annoying for people like me who agree to meet friends up on the terrace (one guy said his friends were already up there) but also a huge loss of income for the operators of the bar on a sunny afternoon. Finally a very snooty girl called Sasha with a clipboard made an appearance. No apologies were offered, she did not seem to see any problem with the crowd in front of her. In addition, if your name was not on the clipboard, that meant no reservation, which meant no access. No apologies for the confusion, the wait, the frustration, the misunderstanding or any form of consolation whatsoever. Just rude short answers. At least 20 people who spent between 15 and 30 minutes waiting in vain were sent away without any form of apology and still at a loss to understand what just happened and why. Even though the hotel may claim that they do not run the bar, I think this reflects very badly on the hotel.", "date_of_review": "11 July 2013"}

We had been keen (celebrating a friends birthday) to venture to the the roof top bar for a cocktail. When we booked the restaurant originally we were told that it would be no problem to go to the bar after the meal - and as we had an early table this was fine. While at the table we took the precaution to check with the Radio Bar that we could go and it would be no problem having spent in excess of \u00a3400 in the restaurant itself -over the course of an evening we were keen to finish the evening with a drink to celebrate. However what we were not expecting was the basic hostility and attitude we experienced as we walked round to the entrance to the bar. We expected to be shown to the bar graciously but instead were told that the bar was \"full\". Having said that we had phoned and were told to go up no problem we were told by these two members of staff that this was not possible (this is a hotel and we definitely spoke to a representative from the roof bar as evidenced from the phone) - as if we made this up. We then rephoned the same number from the mobile and asked them to verify the conversation. The member of staff actually said to us it was not his \"job\" to speak on the phone and verify anything. That was his response. We were denied access to the bar - with no plausible explanation. Immediately after - having faced this treatment - some people queuing immediately behind us - a group of 7 or 8- very casually dressed to say the least were let up to the bar (we were a group of 5 well dressed). All in all contemptuous treatment for no reason whatsoever - how can you represent a hotel and brand and treat customers in this way (I had thought I left this sort of doorman idiocy behind when I was in my 20's- made worse by our unwitting expenditure in good faith). I am appalled that someone could work for this hotel and have this sort of attitude and lack of respect- we live in London we have so much choice we are not in need of access to a bar that has some unfathomable door policy - but as an experience of an evening this attitude belongs in the dark ages and no hotel should endorse staff who think it fit to speak to customers in this way.", "date_of_review": "2 July 2013"}

I always enjoyed it and of course mentioned it to friends and colleagues. My recent experiences make me wish I hadn't.  I recently attempted visits on two separate occasions - both incredibly disappointing. The first time I went with a friend for an after work drink and was told (in a very rude manner) that it was reservations only and also (conversely) first come, first served. I asked if we could put our names down on a waiting list only to be told that this wasn't an option and that we should just to come back later and see if they could let us in. Obviously this wasn't appealing - no-one with any sense would traipse across London to a bar that they may not get in to. Its a nice bar, but not worth that sort of ridiculousness. On the second occasion, I visited with a work colleague on a Monday night at around 10pm. We walked to the entrance where a group of people had gathered. They turned around and said (so abruptly) \"What? Can we help you?\" whilst sniggering. We soon realised that they were all employees so asked them if we were okay to go up. They looked us up and down in the rudest of ways before laughing in our faces and saying it was reservations only and they had no idea if they would have any availability that evening. On the latter occasion I was so incredibly shocked by the rudeness that I went into the hotel to complain. The guys on the door to the skybar radioed the doorman at the hotel to say that an \"eastern European girl with a black dress and pink shoes\" was refused entry and to had just walked into the hotel. This was obviously a reference to me as it matched my outfit and no-one else had walked into the hotel (however I am half Greek and half English so the description was somewhat inaccurate!). I found this SO rude and on the verge of being abusive and discriminatory. I always dress incredibly well and on this occasion was wearing Ralph Lauren and LK Bennett so \"my look\" was hardly an issue. I asked to speak to the manager who was fetched. She was kind but said she had no authority to do anything as the Radio rooftop was a separate business. I advised that I had never experienced such rudeness in any bar or hotel anywhere in the world and I was astounded that this was tolerated. There was a general sense of disinterest. I left for a better bar, never to return again. I am not a hugely fussy person, nor am I very demanding. But I have stayed in some of the world's best hotels and been to some of the best bars and I can honestly say this is the worst bar I have ever encountered. Service is an absolute imperative for any top venue and this falls very far short of the mark. The door staff are rude, uncouth and ill-mannered people who believe that having a clipboard makes them somebody. They have ALOT to learn about the hospitality industry - though I doubt they will learn as they seem too arrogant to even care.  What the Rooftop bar didn't know when they behaved so badly is that I direct the corporate accounts for my company and will never consider sending any business their way ever again. It may not make a material dent but it will certainly ensure that the reputation of this place amongst decent, modern companies is lessened. What a shame that a place with such potential has become a D-star nightspot. A truly poor experience.", "date_of_review": "8 July 2013"}

She prompltly said no, she was not accepting walk ins and our host was not there. Our host then called us from the bar and asked what was going on and I told him, I then gave her his name again, she scanned her clipboard and said he was not there and she was not accepting walk ins and the bar was full to capacity. (think the clipbaord gave her super powers, God help us if she had, had an earpiece).After an exchange of phone calls, with our host, we were let in, when our host sent someone from the bar upstairs to collect us. This lady, who came to collect us, was extremely polite and apologetic for our wait and the misunderstanding. Bar has fantastic views, good music, friendly and mixed crowd. Staff in bar were very service orientated and extremely helpful. If I were going on the attitude of the door staff upon arrival, this bar would a no no. One thing I detest are door / reception staff with bad attitudes. This is the first impression people receive upon arrival, and if it does not change, people can and will take their business elsewhere. These are hard times, and people do have choices, and for a bar in this price range, there are plenty of other places, that you can get a better service and reception. So using the old scam of trying to create a queue, to create hype and interest does not fly anymore and people can and will go elsewhere.

We arrived at about 6 and were made to queue for 10 minutes by two very rude door staff who seemed positively annoyed that we had troubled them with a few questions, before being let up to a fairly empty room. The bar is designed so that the seating outside dominates and there are very few areas to stand if you have not reserved a table. I called up in advance to reserve a table but was told no reservations were taken before 9pm, so I was surprised to learn that there was another list you have to put your name on in order to reserve a table - why was I not told this on the phone? In addition to this, we were told there is a minimum spend of \u00a350 per head if we do place our names on the list to reserve a table.  We ordered a couple of rounds and I was disappointed to see the bar staff free pouring the spirits. When I'm paying \u00a310+ for a G&T I expect the bar staff to use a measure as a sign of both quality and consistency. Needless to say both of my drinks differed in strength quite a bit - not good enough for a 5* Hotel bar. The service was very slow and we had to wait for about 10 minutes for each round.  When my client arrived the bar was quieter than when we had arrived, but he was told by the doorstaff that there was a 30 minute wait, so we decided to venture elsewhere at this point.  Radio Bar need to sort out the ambiguity with the reservation policy and employ some more friendly doorstaff. I understand there is a need for a queuing system sometimes, but I don't expect rudeness from this kind of place. The bar certainly has potential and is worth a visit if you can get in without the fuss. However, if you want rooftop drinking then go to Aqua, SushiSamba or Coq D'Argent, they are all much easier to get in and all have open air terraces.", "date_of_review": "9 July 2013"}

Exactly what I have asked for, maybe I did not express myself correctly?...). Well we got ourselves comfortable and chose our drinks, it took a while for someone to take our order but fine. Drinks were average and service poor. No one came to check if we were happy with the drinks and no one offered a second round. A part from the waitresses, in those very tacky dresses, you could not say who works there.

The views over London are stunning. However, the staff let them place down incredibly and can definitely put a downer on your night and leave you reluctant to return. I booked a table in advance for 8 of us for my boyfriends birthday and was told there would be a minimum spend of \u00a350 per person. This was not a problem at all and we were all happy to pay this. On arrival we were taken to a table that didn't have enought chairs, some of us had to squeeze together. We were not introduced to our hostess and not given any menus. She came over and said 'sorry, you cannot sit here, it is reserved'. I explained I had actually reserved it and she went to us menus. Then another member of staff came over several minutes later and said the exact same thing, asking us to move. A little embaressing to say the least in front of my party of friends. Several bottles of wine and cocktails later, another member of staff came over and wanted me to sign an agreement to what equated to \u00a375 per person and for 11 people. I told him we were a party of 8 and that when I booked it was said we only had to pay \u00a350 pp. He insisted that it was \u00a375 pp and I must have been mistaken. Luckily, I had printed the email booking I had made with the Reservations Manager. I showed this to him and he went through it with a fine toothcomb and then said 'This email is from April. Our prices have changed.' This conversation went back and forth for around 15-20mins, with his attitude being something to desired. He was incredibly rude. We eventually got him to agree to \u00a350 pp but for 9 people, even though we had always been 8. I was tired of arguing by this point and wanted to get on with the night. The tactic of waiting until you've had a few drinks before trying to pull a fast one on the minimum spend is awful and to be honest we probably would have ended up spending more \u00a375 pp anyway, but after this member of staff did this, we deliberately kept an eye on what we were spending and kept to \u00a350 and guess what? No tip either. Train your staff in some customer service. They are already getting a reputation for being some of the worst.", "date_of_review": "17 June 2013"}

My girlfriend, who had arrived 5 minutes before me was let straight into the bar, confirmed that the bar was empty. After much persuasion I was eventually granted 'admission'.  The disappointments and frustrations continued inside the bar... from the bar staff who didn't know the menu and forgot drinks orders to the front of house staff who where rude, unhelpful and more interested in walking around like peacocks then actually working.

You are then escorted to the lift (which requires a hotel card so you can't get in without being escorted). Myself and some friends went on a Saturday afternoon, with a reservation for 3pm.

On arrival, there were no tables outside free, but after a while we were able to get one on the south side overlooking Somerset House and the Thames. Fantastic views from the city, Docklands, South Bank, London Eye, Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace. Could not complain about the views, except maybe about the weather. Cocktails were very nice and a reasonable price (around \u00a310), but beers and spirits were really overpriced in my opinion. The food was also well priced considering the location with a varied selection from burgers fancy finger food. After sitting for a while we discovered that certain tables could be reserved. This was not very well marked, and in the end we had to move a couple of times over the 4 hours we were there which is not exactly ideal.

We had a table ready with a seat for her and, being a Wednesday night there were perhaps 4 people at the bar (max) and plenty of empty tables. We spoke to the manager and they brushed us off.   With that we headed downstairs (rather huffily) to Cucina Asellina for our dinner reservation at 7:30. I have to say the staff there are lovely and very attentive.

Its worth either getting there early to skip the queue or to pre-book to avoid the wait. We only had to wait 20min before we was aloud up to the 10th floor to have a roof top view of London on a sunny day. The only bad part about this place is its service. We walked up to the bar to make eye contact with some of the staff and still be ignored. When I tried to get one of their attentions verbally (to see if we ordered at the bar like I did on my first visit or if it was table service) I was still ignored. Finally, I got the attention of a member of staff who sent someone over to our table to serve use. I would go back again to see if it was just an off day they was having, plus the view canceled out the bad service.", "date_of_review": "15 June 2013"}

However the purpose of our visit was to drink on the rooftop bar at around 5.30pm. I noticed a lot of people had the same intention and it was quite clear from approaching the lifts to reach the rooftop bar that a lady with a clipboard was checking to see if you were on the list. It was clear there was no chance of being able to visit the rooftop bar as as soon as we said we have come here for the bar. We were immediately told there is a two hour wait, so we decided to go for a two hour drink in the downstairs lobby bar called STK. After the two hours were up we went back to the lady at the lifts to be told there was again a two hour wait and that you can not book. Can somebody please explain how you get to drink on the roof top bar? The cynical side of me suggests the lady at the lifts with the clipboard was scripted to tell potential customers the same 'two hour wait' regardless of what time you turned up, and that if you were on the 'list' you were ok. I totally understand residents should have rights to use the bar, but surely there is a waiting list you can be put on, or you should be able to book ahead? I'd hate to think if you surpirsed someone for a date (as one website put it as being a perfect place for), that your date plans would be scuppered.

Without having really seen much about it beforehand, we assumed this hotel was part of a Spanish based operation because having stayed in a few boutique hotels in Spain that was the immediate impression (& all the better for it). To English eyes, it does feel a bit \"over designed\" but it is worth seeing. Getting to the bar was a bit complicated. Having gone straight to the lifts & realising we needed a pass to get to the top floor, we asked one of the staff who very helpfully retrieved a pass from the concierge & gave us access. It is lovely up there & again, on a sunny day, felt like we were sitting in Madrid. So noting management are looking at these reviews - it took an age for our drinks to arrive. I can't particularly blame the staff - it wasn't busy & there were plenty of them - it just seemed the barman was a bit overwhelmed by himself & doing a cocktail was a bit more complicated so took longer. Also not sure how access to the bar for non-residents will work when things are a bit busier. Do you queue at the lifts?

Despite this though and the fact it was drizzling, I've got to say I was immediately blown away. Its got the swank factor whilst being somewhere you can chill out and relax even with 2 hyperactive kids. Great, alternative vista of the Thames and what a roof terrace. The whole bar has an amazing ambience, definitely the closest I have come to Ibiza without getting on a plane.  Decent mix of clientele although we did have a few people turning their noses up at our young kids clambering around the place and a group of 4 people who should have known better pushed past us to get in the lift when we left. This is something the hotel though cannot control.  I have to say I am very surprised at the reviews criticising the service. Once we got in the bar this was perfect. All the different staff were friendly and attentitive throughout our stay.  Would have liked to try more of the food as my daughter absolutely loved the whitebait.  I will be going back ASAP.

So - an hour and a half trip for the family - and met by a man in the doorway who referred us to the hostess. There was already an animated group with the hostess, who had done the same as me, and she was telling them that there was no room in the bar, as it had already been fully reserved. They had done the same as us and phoned ahead and couldn't understand how it had been reserved, when they were told you couldn't reserve. I got the same story, so asked if we could wait in the bar until a place became free. She told me that couldn't be done, but we should try and come back in two hours (we got there at 4pm), but couldn't be promised a place. There were groups of people coming after us, who had done exactly the same - so lots of disappointed potential customers. We did go back about an hour an a half later and again followed a queue of people being turned away. By this time the poor hostess looked shell shocked, didn't recognise me from our earlier visit and gave me the exact same line and told me to come back in another two hours. Very shabby treatment.

It was a special day because I was indroducing my partner to my parents and he suggested to go to this place. It was our first time going to this place but we didnt hesitate to go as we heard about the breathtaking views that the bar offers. I have to say that the place is just amazing, very modern and elegant decoration and the terrace is just exclusive; the views are impressive; however, these good aspects were not enough..the service spoilt the whole experience. When we arrived, no hostess came to receive us, we waited for some minutes till my partner finally catched one of them. We were seated in a lovely table in the inside part in one of the corners, the only thing is that we were seated when the table was still dirty and with empty glasses from the previous guests. That detail just made me feel embarrased and disappointed. I would have not mind to wait a couple of minutes while they cleaned the table None of that was done. Not a good start. we waited 10 minutes to get the menu and 15 minutes to order. I asked for the table to be cleaned (that is not something that should happend in a 5-star hotel). After being waiting for around 20 minutes for our drinks my partner tried to get the atention of one of the waitresses who went to check what was going on with our drinks...she came back telling me that they ran out of one of the ingredients for one of the cocktails so I had to change the order. The drinks finally arrived after 30 minutes since we order the firs time, I think it is not a big deal to make two cocktails, a gin and tonic and a spresso...The cocktails were not wow and the gintonic came already mix (no tonic on the side). Nobody came to ask how was everything or if we needed anything else...poor service again. Our empty glasses were on top of the table for a long time, so we didnt even think about a second round. I left the place very sad and upset, my espectations about the place just fell down and the fact that I took my parents there because of my partner recomendation, just made us feel so embarrased.

We entered the hotel lobby only to be escorted back out into the cold to reenter 20 metres up the street to the sound of crashing plates and the sight of food spread all over the floor. It was not a good start. But worse was yet to come. We were ushered back to the lobby we had originally attempted to enter and were faced with a young inexperienced ear-pieced \"host\" who informed us with a superficial smile that there was no room for us in the rooftop bar, despite having reconfirmed our booking there 30 minutes previously by phone. No attempt was made to accommodate us nor were we given any indication of how long we would need to wait. We were advised to stay in the corridor and it was pointed out that the small print of the offer allowed for this eventuality. This did not seem an adequate way for a 5 star hotel to treat its guests. When we voiced our unhappiness we were met with standard call-centre responses such as \"I understand what you are saying\" and \"I can understand your frustration\" but no resolution or helpful advice of any kind. We asked to speak to a manager and instead were given another \"host\" who reiterated identical responses and maintained he had no power to help us, and lacked the imagination to even offer us a complimentary drink. By now we had been waiting for 30 minutes. We asked again to speak with the manager and decided to sit at the lobby bar and order a drink. Eventually another young inexperienced staff member appeared. He did not give us his name or job title and merely reiterated the same story, saying that someone would come and get us when a table was ready. Half an hour later noone had bothered to check on us, so we left in disgust having had our evening ruined, hungry and deeply disappointed by the experience. The lack of customer care was shocking and inexcusable, particularly for a 5 star hotel, and neither of us had ever experienced anything like it before. In our jobs as a journalist and a finance director we regularly stay at luxury hotels around the world. This is by far the worst experience either of us has had.

We had been keen to visit the rooftop bar (it had been too busy on previous occasions) so we asked the bar waitress if she could reserve a table for after dinner. She had been helpful throughout, serving and recommending some great cocktails and confirmed a table was booked upstairs. We headed to the restaurant for a fantastic meal...great service lovely food and the sort of music that makes you want to stay until the early hours. Reasonably priced for the quality of food and wine. We had a couple of reasons for wanting to visit the rooftop bar...looked great in photos so were keen on corporate hire and a looming 40th birthday. So, we strolled along and met an apparently pleasant chap who was the 'host' of the rooftop bar. We said that we had a booking, made by STK restaurant in our name. At this point the attitude changed. This chap with the previously welcoming smile, decided to tell us \"I don't think so, nobody from STK had been out to speak to us!'\". He had no interest in listening to us. We tried to explain the booking, but to no avail with this 'host'.  In our years of staying in and enjoying the great service of many hotels and restaurants of equal and higher standing, I have never come across someone who has questioned someone's honesty in such a sneering way. The laugh of 'I don't think so' grated on me the whole way home. You would think the 'host' owned the bar/hotel. Goodness knows what business he is turning away. I will visit STK again and perhaps have a look to see if that host is still hosting again, before deciding if i will spend money in the rooftop bar.  His 5 minutes of 'jumped up....' manner spoiled an otherwise perfect evening for the birthday girl, I can understand that the bar has attracted a great following so early on, but a booking made within the hotel should be honoured or at least investigated and this chap's attitude is not one that I would wish to be associated with a corporate or birthday hire.

The events person I spoke to was so unhelpful and unaccommodating that we are going elsewhere. Such a shame as the bar looks lovely. It has left me and my friends with a very bad impression and we won't be trying here again.", "date_of_review": "19 March 2013"}

Those not staying should venture through reception and ask for access to Radio Bar ( access does require either a room key or concierge key but don't hesitate to be authoritative about asking to be swiped up to bar as this is usual practice) A big hint here is that due to popularity you really need to be in by 5pm as otherwise as things heat up they put in a waiting system in the lobby bar allowing access only when room available. The terrace has fabulous view - a real treat to see the sun set and have a few sliders - food very tasty too...This is going to be a huge hot spot in the summer - reservations can be made for bottle service so if you say you are goign to drink a few bottles of wine etc there is every chance you can walk in later and bypass ques.  Assellina the Italian restaurant is fabulous - good prices, great service and food cooked to order - we skipped desert to have a glass of champagne on the roof and coffee.", "date_of_review": "25 March 2013"}

Everything is chrome and black. We went up to the Radio rooftop bar for some lunch. It was very quiet but the views were excellent. The outside area will be great in warm weather and has lovely seating areas with outdoor heaters. The service was good but our meal a little disappointing. It was rather cold when it arrived at the table - I am not sure where the kitchen is but if it has come up from the ground floor where the other 2 restaurants are then that might explain it. The waitress told us that the Salt Beef on Rye was rather dry so would we like thinner cut bread - the bread was thinner but the sandwich still very dry. I am surprised that the kitchen have not rectified this as the waitress said most people complained that it was too dry. The desserts were good but one came as the wrong order and had to be changed. Whilst the staff in the bar were very pleasant they seemed a little inexperienced and not to have the professional finish that one would expect in a hotel of this calibre.", "date_of_review": "26 March 2013"}

The service was really friendly but slightly chaotic. The view is fascinating - take a Londoner to point out the main sights (I'm happy to volunteer for you). Will be lovely in summer to sit on the wide terrace.  A tip - check in at the lobby desk on the ground floor as soon as you arrive as they need to give you access to the lift.", "date_of_review": "30 March 2013"}

Shame about the staff or their briefing. Arrived on time for a party but not allowed up to the roof until we could confirm our hosts were there. Unfortunately our super powers do not extend to seeing up 10 floors of a building so had to wait until our hosts arrived. In meantime our greeter thought it necessary to share with us that we had to spend \u00a350 each. So no discretion there. The greeter was admittedly quite pretty but had no idea of customer service, basic manners or how to deal with queries. She chewed gum, could not count and I suppose was just thick. When we eventually were allowed upstairs the drinks took ages to arrive - suggest they take some bodyguards off security and get them mixing the cocktails as otherwise will take will take time to get to \u00a350 each! Would love to recommend it but would be embarrassed to with the \"clip board nazis\", thick staff and the charges Was a great relief to go for dinner elsewhere and receive great service. Suggestion retrain your staff and until you really are exclusive don't act like you are", "date_of_review": "21 April 2013"}

Usually we don't take time to write reviews but we had such a good experience that we wanted to share it. The cocktails were excellent, not too pricy, the view is amazing and above all, the service we got was quite unique (thanks to Adrian, the guest manager who was very helpful, professional and nice, putting us in a perfect mood from the start). Definitely a place we will recommend to friends and colleagues.", "date_of_review": "6 May 2013"}

Added bonus as it was a glorious day. Unfortunately you are not able to reserve an area. We arrived about 3pm hoping that the lunch time rush would have abated, but we were told that there was a two hour wait and we could have a drink in the downstairs bar. We decided to wait and orderd a bottle of champagne. After seeing several people come in behind us and go straight up to the roof bar, we were told we could now go up. We paid the bill before leaving the downstairs bar, but were changed an extra \u00a310 on top of the price of the \u00a380 bottle of champagne for service charge. If I have received good service I would have absolutely no hesitation paying this, but the champagne was just left on the table without an ice bucket and the water we asked for never materialised. So the service was in fact just for bringing over the the drinks. We expressed our surprise at the service charge but the young girl who served us said that there was nothing she could do about it as the manager wasn't available. Not wishing to appear 'tight' we just paid the bill and went upstairs. When we arrived upstairs, the outside area was busy, but there is also a very nice bar before you reach the outside area that was practically empty, so we have absolutely no idea why we were not able to go straight to the bar without having a drink downstairs first. The service upstairs was equally as shocking. We asked for water 3 times and it only arrived on the 3rd time (obviously the champagne arrived on time!). Nontheless, the views were amazing, and there was a DJ, giving a holiday vibe. The roof terrace is worth a visit (if you are allowed up there), but certainly not expect 5* service.", "date_of_review": "22 April 2013"}
