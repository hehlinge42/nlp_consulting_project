Dessert panacotta was delicious.

Whilst the service and drinks were nice (I had one Aperol Spritz and then a Campari Spritz), I was underwhelmed by the food. I knew the pasta dishes were small so you could try a few, and I enjoy that part as I have been a a few Italian restaurants like this, so this was no issue. However, the food itself was just disappointing. I could have made better at home sadly, and in comparison to other restaurants I have been to (Padella, for example), it was spectacularly below the standard that I had expected. I had the 'Spaghetti' dish, which consisted of peas and cheese, and we ordered garlic bread. The garlic bread was rather sparse in terms of portion - 1 piece each, which is a shame as I enjoyed that. The pasta was a bit bland, nice cheese on top, but I expected better. I would come again to try a few dishes, maybe it was just a bad night, as it wasn't terrible.

(We all arrived within 5 minutes of our allotted time) Despite the off-putting atmosphere from the servers, the food was all perfectly acceptable and only worth it because of the 10\u00a3 pasta wine deal, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have bothered as the pasta wasn\u2019t anything spectacular for the price.

We ordered lots of things to share and it came to just over \u00a330 each which including a couple of bottles of wine I don\u2019t think is bad value at all!  The food was very good:  For the anti pasti we had the garlic toast, ham and mustard pears, mozzarella, smoked eels, mussels and punterelle (posh chicory with anchovies). Then we shared spaghetti with roasted tomato and Parmesan and radiatore with garlic parsley and chilli. We also had roasted potatoes and bread and butter!  The food was fresh with a blend of traditional and experimental Italian flavours. I feel like you can always trust a place that does wonderful things with its vegetables! The radiatore and garlic toast was our favourite and we ordered extra!  The ambience was fun and trendy! And Peckham is a cool place with lots of bars to go to before or after. The staff were friendly and welcoming. Also forza wins Instagram account is hilarious definitely check it out!  Where there is room for improvement: Im pescatarian so didn\u2019t try it but my friends said the ham and pear was very strange and a bit like supermarket sliced ham on a plate with a tinned pear (it looked like that) however I didn\u2019t try that dish and everything else was amazing!  The mozzarella was flavoured to perfection but at \u00a312 very overpriced. Probably because people are willing to pay for it. I guess that\u2019s capitalism for you!  That said, generally good value for a top notch unusual Italian. I really liked it and would come again.", "date_of_review": "28 March 2019"}

Somehow they had decided we were a party of 18, don't know why, a quick count would have shown them otherwise. They decided to give us sharing dishes, but as they were cooking for too few, there wasn't enough to go round and it left most of us hungry. The vegetarians were worst off, there was one dish for them - pasta with a plain tomato sauce, and little left over after the meat eaters had had their share.  When we explained to the manager that we hasn't had much food, he became very defensive, despite us explaining the problem calmly. He said that he'd asked one person on the table (not the person who's birthday it was) and they'd said it was 18 people and hadn't let him know about any dietary requirements. It was baffling that he thought that one person would know everyone's dietary requirements, or even necessarily know the size of the party.  Rather than offer to make us more food, which we would have happily paid for, we were given excuse after excuse. I wonder if they'd perhaps run out of pasta, or their 'awesome sauce'.

The food started coming at 20:00 The bread and olives were very welcomed as I was starving by then. The whipped bean paste was delicious but I only got a spoonful. The grilled vegetables were nice but had to order more. The 1st lot of toasted almonds were too salty for me but they brought some more with less salt on and they were lovely. The pasta was yummy and so was the steak. I liked the flat bread (which I watched one of the chaps made and baked in the wood oven) especially when it had soaked up all the meat juices. There was a lot going on and somehow the salsa verde got a bit lost. As I write this, I can't remember how it tasted. The steak was cooked just right. The Panzanella was very good. I would have liked to eat that before the steak. It deserved to be savoured separately. The grilled peaches with mascarpone and ground hazelnut were heavenly. A cash bar was a good idea. This way, people can buy rounds and lighter drinkers won\u2019t feel there are subsidising the heavier one. The wine list wasn't long nor was it expensive.  So far so good, then why only 3 stars? This is partly because Tripadvisor only let us have one lot of scores, so it has to be an average score. The food was definitely 5 stars but not so much the \"restaurant\" itself. It is a converted warehouse. I take my hat off to them for spending time and effort doing it up, putting in the kitchen, loos, plumbing, etc, but it wasn't very comfortable. Those benches were narrow and hard. For an evening lasting from 7:30 to gone 11:00, one's posterior was getting numb. My back started to hurt half-way through the evening, too. I don't mind sharing food with strangers. But it would have worked better if the food were served on smaller dishes so that they are spread out more evenly on the long tables. More difficult was having to make small talk with the people next to me. It can work really well if you click and have lots to talk about. Otherwise it doesn\u2019t make for a very convivial evening, particularly if you, like me, are not a heavy drinker, and had to watch the other groups getting more and more raucous and with no way of escaping. Of course, age might have something to do with it\u2026 Going as a group of 6 might be best. You then have enough mates to fall back on when conversation with the new neighbours falters. You will also be served with the right amount of food, and won't have to worry about sharing too often.  The team was very welcoming and friendly and ensured we had a good evening. What a dilemma! I love the food but found the setting uncomfortable. Would I return? I would actually, but will definitely bring a cushion and five friends, and I want to try their Wednesday pasta and sauce!", "date_of_review": "21 August 2016"}

It's an unusual concept in that you queue (on a weds) to pay for pasta (1 option of meat or vegetarian)and a drink for \u00a310 and then sit at communal tables and wait for the food to arrive. Normally queuing is enough to make me go somewhere else, however I persevered on this occasion and how glad I was. The pasta is delicious. Home made pasta with a home made pesto which was the best I've eaten. We managed to bag the one side table which wasn't communal and where you could see all the goings on in the open kitchen. By the time we left the place was rammed and no end of people still queuing to get in.  If you haven't been but we're thinking about it then go. We Will definitely be going back.

There are 2 communal tables and we took up most of one, so I didn't have to share plates with strangers. If you come here as a couple you will definitely have to share so be prepared to get to know the people next to you! It was incredibly hot inside, there is no air con (this is an industrial space turned into a restaurant) and the combination of a hot day and hot ovens was quite uncomfortable.  The menu was advertised as 5 courses although course 3 and 4 came at the same tie (i.e. one was essentially a side dish). The first course was fine - bread with a bean dip, roasted vegetables, almonds and olives. The dip was good although exceptionally garlicky (you could smell garlic in the corridor of the Bussey Building on the walk round to the restaurant)! The veg were delicious. Almonds far too salty.  The next course was a pasta dish, really simple and fresh although could have done with some of the salt from the almonds... Following this we had strips of steak which were cooked to perfection and melt in the mouth. This came with panzanella (course 4) which was nice and tasty new potatoes (not the flatbread that was advertised but that was fine with me). Each person only gt 2-3 very small slices of the steak which was such a shame as it was so tasty. Likewise with dessert, each person only got half a peach with mascarpone. I did enjoy the food but felt for \u00a335 a head it was far too much. Bread, bean dip and roast veg should be no more than \u00a35-6. A small bowl of pasta likewise. Half a peach, maybe \u00a33.50. I could forgive this if there was more of the steak but 2 small slices just didn't suffice! I didn't leave feeling hungry my any means but just felt a bit short changed.  I also thought it was extremely unreasonable that vegetarians also paid \u00a335. Instead of steak they were given baked aubergine, which is in no way a fair substitute in terms of price. Also to note, a couple brought their dog into the restaurant and it sat underneath the table where we were dining. I have a dog and this didn't bother me but for some people this can be quite off putting.  The place has a great vibe and it's perfect for birthdays/going with a group, I just think it is priced too high.", "date_of_review": "30 August 2016"}

Overall the experience was good. The bar had some fantastic cocktails and the ambience was great. However, the pasta course was definitely over cooked and the pudding was advertised as tiramisu (on the board hanging in the restaurant on the day of dining). This actually turned out to be half a grilled peach, definitely not a comparison to a tiramisu! The service was great however I do not think the style of serving worked. We were a large group and had to squeeze on to the benches to fit in. The part of the table I was on ended up sharing each dish between about 8, whereas further down it was shared between 4 or 5. I think the quantity of food would be ideal if shared between 4 or 6 and would have definitely been much better value for money.

If you've googled Forza Win, you'll know all about the format -- it's banquet style dining, at long benches (there are 2, holding 20something each). If you're not in a big group, you'll be sharing with strangers, and if that puts you off, don't go -- it's a fairly long time (c. 3 hours) to be uncomfortable. But if you're in a big group, it'll feel like a dinner party -- except you don't have to cook or clean. (I trust that's where the \"Win\" comes from)  I was unimpressed by the food itself, unfortunately. I should caveat this by saying some people seem to love it (and my BF liked it more than I did, although with some reservations also) so (i) i might just be a cow or (ii) maybe it was an off night.  The best dish was the papardelle with scottish mushrooms. It had that incredibly satisfying slight thickness that proper home-made pasta has, and was in a really tasty mushroom sauce. The portion was small -- one heaped pasta dish between 6 people. You could tell everyone wanted a bit more, which is especially weird if the other 4 are strangers. Same goes for the whipped white-bean dip starter -- a little more would have been nice. Conversely, there was plenty of the main -- rump from Flock & Herd with sides of roasted new potatoes and panzanella. The potatoes were fine. The rump was completely cooked through -- and it wasn't just our piece, the group down the table from us had the same. I'm not even sure how you do that when the piece is that big. It was also unevenly seasoned -- some bits were totally bland and others were too salty. The whole thing made me sad. The flatbread underneath was a clever idea though, as it soaked up the steak juices. I was indifferent to it myself, but others definitely rated it.  The panzanella was uneven. It didn't feel like the bread had been properly marinated. Some pieces of the bread had (allegedly) pulled in the juices, but all of the pieces I picked hadn't, and just tasted like stale bread coated in olive oil. It was also under salted. I did not like it. When I've had nice panzanella before, it's been more juicy and therefore flavourful -- while the bread isn't meant to be falling apart, it should be moist at least. Having said that, I have since discovered another local place that sells basically the same thing, also calling it panzanella, so maybe I'm the one in the wrong. The dessert -- half a red wine poached pear in a frangelico mascarpone -- was also disappointing. The cheese was great, but the pear needed more sugar, and a little spice. Also I'm not sure half a small pear is a decent pudding size, but then I'm a glutton. I'm in two minds as to whether the whole thing is good value. I was definitely full at the end, but only because I'd filled up on the potatoes, and not on things that were really good, like the pasta and the bean dip, or the things that should have been good, like the steak. To put it another way, in terms of volume by weight alone, it's probably good value. But I didn't feel like the standard of the cooking, accounting for how each dish was apportioned, amounted to good value.  I think I will try one of the Awesome Sauce evenings (Wednesdays, no booking, \u00a310 for pasta and a glass of wine/beer) given that I liked the pasta, and to see if it was just an off evening.
