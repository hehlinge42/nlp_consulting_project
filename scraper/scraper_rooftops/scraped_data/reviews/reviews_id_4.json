We were told that it was 'table service' and by scanning a bar code someone would come over to us to take our order. Well this didn't happen, we waited about 40 minutes each time to get a drink, despite consistently asking for service. The food service was even worse! 8 of us ordered food and only 6 meals came. We complained about this and they said the food would come shortly. Another 5 of us ordered food and this came before the 2 outstanding meals. We enquired again about the missing food. Another person ordered food and their food came before the two outstanding meals. We repeatedly asked the our servers where our food was and he kept saying i don't know ask they guy who took your order or said 'it's coming'. My friend actually had to go to the food stand and enquire about her order herself , to which they said that they hadn't ever received it!!! We waited an hour for this food, ridiculous. They then bought out an extra burger shortly after, despite us not ordering it. For some very odd reason, they decided not to take payment immediately after ordering, so towards the end of the night we had a very rude server come over to us with a receipt and accuse us of underpaying (due to their mistake with some beers and a burger). This man then refused to listen to us and bought over the manager. Who outrageously said he'd been watching us on CCTV and had seen how much we had paid and we were wrong! What a ridiculous statement and an intimidation technique!! In the end, they accepted it was their mistake. Later on in the night we experienced again this poor service, where we ordered three wines and only one came! When i enquired 20 minutes later they said the bar was 'busy'. But my friend placed an order 2 minutes later and got their beers straight away. It took 30 minutes for these other wines to arrive. To be quite honest they ruined my night. I had been the previous year and it was decent but I will never come back. I understand with COVID-19 they are facing new challenges, but I have been to other bars/restaurants and not experienced this horrific service. Likewise, the bouncers are rude, they are very nice to the girls and are very rude and aggressive with the boys. STEER CLEAR", "date_of_review": "3 August 2020"}

Both women/ girls on the 2nd desk were extremely unprofessional and told us they couldn\u2019t help , did not offer to dry the table for us we did this our self but completely impossible keeping it dry due to how heavy the rain was and also refused to offer us any sort of discount if we were willing to sit in the rain.

I have never been in a situation like this before and definitely won\u2019t be returning to pergola due to the unprofessionalism and immaturity of their staff !

Due to COVID rules with London in tier two we thought we should try and sit outside even though we could sit inside. But on the day the weather was terrible so they allowed us to sit inside but on two different tables. We didn't argue but we were disappointed and confused. Then looking around at other tables who were clearly not social distancing and clearly from different households (so we assume in a bubble) we couldn't work out why we had to sit separately. After many lengthy, annoying chats with managers they allowed us to sit together. What really cheesed us off the most was they waited until we had spent (a lot of) money on food and drinks before splitting us up. Seemed like a scam.  The inside was nicely decorated with flowers (fake) so good for pictures and it was quite warm despite it being October. Toilets were clean and never full. We ordered a giant prosecco, pitcher of beer and food from the three vendors. I had a Katsu Curry which was really nice but did have a wee kick. Outside was blustery and cold so we didn't stay long.

We were celebrating a birthday with about 20 of us going. We booked a table 2 months in advance and made sure it was for 20 people.  Upon arrival the two door staff decided they didn't like the look of my brother so they pulled him aside acting like fake police for a detailed search, they pulled out all his possessions, shone a torch down his trousers and said \"Where are the drugs!?\" rifling through his wallet pulling all the cards out looking for drugs. There were of course no drugs the whole thing was uncalled for.  A short while after this happened my brother looked in his wallet and his credit card was missing. The bouncers definitely took his card, it was securely in a slot in his wallet and was used about 5 minutes before to come out of the tube station. He checked his online banking and there was a purchase of some \u00a3105 Nike trainers made within 15 minutes of us being searched. Confronting the door staff they denied it. The door staff at this place are absolute criminals and this matter has been taken up with the police.  After being manhandled and robbed by the bouncers we went downstairs \"underground\" to a fake rooftop bar. I was under the impression it would be on a roof seeing as it is called \"Pergola on the roof\". The whole place was extremely hot with no aircon.  We were shown to our prebooked table for 20 which was actually about 3 small tables put together barely enough for 10 people. After complaining the lady said your booking is for a mix of seated and standing. What a con. The pre-booked prosecco arrived and it was just two cheap \u00a35 bottles absolute rip off. We said can you at least bring some chairs over she said yes but disappeared and didn't come back.  After a few drinks we decided to get some fast food from the stands running around the side. \u00a314 for a basic burger without chips. The burger place produced a burger within a few minutes, it's no wonder because it was red raw, they basically through it on the grill for a minute on each side. A few of our group said they were vomitting the next day I'm certain it was these underdone burgers. There is medium rare, then there is completely rare where it is barely cooked.  So if you are thinking of planning a visit here to celebrate with your friends be prepared to have your credit card stolen and used by the bouncers, get food poisoning, and relax at a table with your non-existent pre-booked seats.

Drinks were nice, although the bar is card only and we ordered food from the dumpling (an choi) and sushi (temaki bros) stalls, which arrived promptly. Food was absolutely delicious, portions were decent sized considering the prices- chicken dumplings and bao buns were my favourites.  The only downside were the toilets- not very clean and full of insects. The floor is also basically just loose rocks and I imagine it would quite hard to walk on with heels.

The entrance gives the feel of entering an exclusive venue, but this raises the stakes too high. It is geared for large groups to drink and be merry. There is little else in terms of distractions in the area as it is a large space. The queues for the bar can take 20 to 30 minutes at busy times, which is a long time to wait. The centre of the area often becomes filled with people impatiently waiting. There are side areas to purchase food, but they can be regularly understocked. Leaving you to wait for food. Once again this is a slightly pretentious place that offers little for what it is worth. If you have a free drink voucher it is worth a quick stop, but like everything you have to wait to gain very little.", "date_of_review": "23 July 2019"}

We were able to book a table online fairly easily and arrived about 5:30 on the Saturday. Location is quite easy to get to and the set up at the location is pretty cool. There are 2 bars and a couple of food stalls serving street food - burgers, chicken, noodles etc. The drinks menu is extensive with loads of cocktails, beers and wine to choose from. Don\u2019t get too excited about the cocktails though as most are made from pre-made pur\u00e9es and juice, other than the gins which are quite well done. We arrived at 5:30 but by about 7 quite a few of the cocktails - particularly those on tap had run out. You can get a free frose which you register for online before you go, they will give you a ticket when you check-in. The frose is lovely although again periodically runs out due to its popularity so you may have to wait. The security staff are amazing and on the look out to make sure you keep your space and there isn\u2019t over crowding. The bar staff are lovely but are pretty slow. We went on the hottest day in June and although they had \u2018air conditioning\u2019 and fans it was still pretty hot. Although it\u2019s on a roof top it is enclosed just with big windows. Great if the weather isn\u2019t too good as you can still enjoy it, but on a hot day is a bit close. There were a few people celebrating birthdays and hen parties who had some neat areas they had set aside which were good.

Be aware, this is mainly a crowd of late teens/early twenty somethings. Heading downstairs we found a packed out space of yet more large picnic benches. We were shown to ours (we had ore booked) and squeezed 11 of us into a table that should probably just fit 8 comfortably! The bar staff kept disappearing but eventually we were seen before choosing to get a kebab. After 15 minutes of queueing some of our group joined our queue as the dumpling kiosk they were at decided to close, presumably because they were unable to keep up with demand. 10 minutes later we were all turned away from the kebab kiosk, again, closing and turning us away. Heading to the burger kiosk we got the front after another 15 minute queue and had to wait again as they had run out if buzzers. We eventually ordered our food and sat back down to wait a further 30 minutes for our buzzers to alert us if our food being ready.

Booked a table for lunch for myself and two adult daughters during our visit to Olympia (not Kingdom Street) but then received an email to say the \"restaurant\" was not opening until 4.00pm - despite being advertised as a venue for lunch on the Olympia International Horse Show website. Then after a series of email exchanges informed, yes, it would be opening at 12.00pm after all because of the show. Arrived promptly on the day (the venue was practically empty), we needed quick service as our show started at 12.45pm, all of us decided on burgers from Patty&Bun. Went up to order and was told rather dismissively by the young man that they were not opening until 1.30pm - I do not like being called \"mate\", by the way, sonny Jim! Quickly ordered fish fingers from \"Claw\" as time was pressing - this took nearly 20 minutes to prepare and then discovered they had got the order completely wrong! It was too late to sort out and there was absolutely no time to eat our food by the time it was ready. We took it with us but could not get it past arena security - so, had to bolt it down whilst standing in the foyer with crowds bustling past.

(make sure that you access it via Paddington Central area along the canal as the rear access from the road system is untidy and backs onto bridges and rough areas) The restaurant is a food-court where you are seated and then choose which of a number of outlets you want food from. There is a reasonable selection with a duck kiosk, a burger kiosk, a Vietnamese kiosk and a Taco/Mexican style kiosk. You walk up to the kiosk of your choice and buy your dishes there - they give you a buzzer/pager and you come back when it goes off. Drinks are bought separately from a cashless bar to the side. We visited on a Saturday lunchtime and there was plenty of space and the food was quick to be ready. We mainly had the duck from the Canard kiosk and it was very tasty and nicely prepared with great chips (cooked in duck fat!!). It cost ~\u00a345 for 4 adults and another ~\u00a318 for drinks. This seems to be a very popular venue for light social lunches with a bar and there were a number of groups there (~8 in each) and lots of small families and friends in groups of 3-4. The main seating area is inside but in a loft type area with radiant heaters near each table that warmed it nicely - there is another roof area which is more 'outside'. People seemed very happy and having fun and it had a great social feeling - like this was a regular Saturday thing for many - which I enjoyed.

We booked a table for 5pm and were told to sit at one of the middle benches until then. We were then taken to our table which were two small tables pushed together at the side of the venue in area W.  The area was absolutely freezing in the area we were moved to, heaters only covered the middle benches and we had a dreadful draft.  A couple of hours in we noticed the whole venue was absolutely freezing. We were told it was disconnected and spoke to staff a number of times who just told us the heating was off whilst sitting in their large jackets. The website states the venue is fully heated.  I found a lot of the female staff in this venue extremely rude and unhelpful as we asked for our table to be moved as we were absolutely freezing but no apologies or resolution for this issue was offered.  The two girls in big jackets at the door were very unhelpful and unapologetic.  The free drink offer is also an absolute shambles. There is no scanning a code or anything, it is simply the bar staff deciding who they have already served or not to the point where my friend did not get a single free drink despite the email because a member of bar staff said he had already served her which was not true. This was very unfair and embarrassing for my friend when they accused her of this. They then served another girl two free drinks because she was \u201ca friend of her brother\u2019s\u201d.  When we were leaving the venue, we left via the same door we came in. There were a group of dodgy looking people (presumably staff) smoking and drinking sitting on the floor when a European girl with a cigarette came over in an absolute flap shouting at us telling us to get inside now and that we can\u2019t exit this way in an extremely rude manner and trying to herd us in like animals. She even ran down the road to get another group of people and made them walk back in when they left in front of us. There was no security or signs on this door. Security then arrived and simply rolled his eyes at her.  Drinks were expensive, as was the food but it was expected as I had seen the menus.

This time the weather was nice and warm, on Sunday afternoon. The place was reasonably crowded but not overwhelmingly. Still the queue at the bar was very long and slow, mostly due to very inexperienced and slow bar tenders. Tried to order an aperol spriz and it was not available. Tried a few other cocktails and the answer was that they were not available Only basic gin and tonic, rum and coke and vodka soda were basically available. I ordered a bottle beer and i was served one that was totally warm. The bar tender did not bother asking me whether i would be ok with a warm beer, just opened the bottle and gave it to me.  This is so amateur and consistently poorly managed for a venue with such potential. Real shame.", "date_of_review": "11 June 2018"}

She booked a table and was told that there \u201cwasn\u2019t a roof here and the tables where all downstairs\u201d which isn\u2019t true. There are tables upstairs however it\u2019s not got as many and they made everyone book their tables downstairs and no one was upstairs. The upstairs was ok but poor I said they don\u2019t book you up here and omg downstairs is AWFUL! The pictures online show it being completely open roof and it\u2019s not. This place has a roof on it in the style of a greenhouse roof and OH MY GOD ITS HOT! I\u2019ve been to colder places in Dubai. Yes, they have fans but they do absolutely nothing to gain any sort of temperature regulation. I have no idea who\u2019s idea it was to put a greenhouse style roof on a event place that would be used in the summer but whoever it is needs to go on a health and safety course as this is so dangerous. Every single person in there had sweat dripping off them. Everyone was using the napkins to dry the sweat. We had to put ice cubes from our prosecco bucket into our bras to cool us down. After an hour the place lost about half the people in it because no one could bare the heat. We had so much sweat on us all the girls had sweat patches when they stood up on their bums and backs! Ruining the outfits. Our hair was WET from the sweat! If you sit on the benches it\u2019s so hot that you actually slide down them on the sweat on your legs. When you walk down from the roof you get an instant smack in the face from the heat worse than getting off an aeroplane. They do have water around EVERYWHERE but you\u2019re only allowed a small cup. There\u2019s danger of someone dehydrating in there mixing that amount of heat with alcohol. Although after 1 jug of pimms you\u2019re so hot it puts you off even drinking - made obvious by the fact that when we first got there you couldn\u2019t move to get a drink and after an hour there was no queue and you can walk straight to the bar for the rest of the day. It ruined our friends birthday and left everyone annoyed and boiling to the point where even some of the guests went home. Why it needs this roof I will never know as it\u2019s only open in the summer therefore it\u2019s not going to be in danger of being cold! ", "date_of_review": "8 July 2018"}

We were unlucky in that after a month of sunshine, we had heavy rain. However because when you book tables, you have to book downstairs and indoors, that wasn\u2019t an issue. What was a problem was the security guard on the door upstairs.  We had to sprint in the rain to get there because taxis can\u2019t get close to the door. The jobsworth on the door put the rope up in front of us and said \u201cno walk-ins, you booked?\u201d We were being rained on by stormy rain so said \u201cyes of course\u201d. He then walked off and left us there. My friend tried to move the rope back a little so that it was at least under the cover and was shouted at by the idiot on the door. We got that there\u2019s a list but leaving people outside in torrential rain when their company have paid thousands of pounds isn\u2019t good... it\u2019s also just really, really crap as person. Bit more consideration would be lovely. When we got in, the staff were apologetic for him and seemed embarrassed, but too late. If the first thing you see is some idiot on the door who treats you like crap, that\u2019s what you\u2019ll take away.  When we found our table, it was alright I guess. Drinks are ridiculously expensive but the food is good. So it\u2019s hit and miss.  There are a few staff walking around cleaning up but not many so don\u2019t expect any help. With the plastic roof, its kind of like if you went to a campsite to eat and drink in a really humid country, and you wanted to pay \u00a310 a drink for the pleasure of being yelled at by security.
