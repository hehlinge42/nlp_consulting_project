I thought the drinks prices were fine - \u00a36 for a beer, 10 for a double G&T, 12 for cocktails. Food was nothing special but then again you pay for the location. I found the service really slow. At first we didn't mind, as we didn't feel rushed. But when we had to get up for a second cocktail, then to order the food, then to enquire about the wine which hadn't arrived, it felt like there wasn't enough waiters or barmen to serve the clientele.

I have never had a restaurant or bar change the wine without asking us, especially to one more expensive.

Both times were not up to expectations. We reserved a table and the view over Trafalgar Square cannot be faulted. We were seated promptly and service was good up until this point. We waited ages for our order to be taken. We had to get off our seat and asked the lady who seated us to take our order. It is not a large area and there was no excuse for not noticing us. We placed the order and asked if we could have the dishes staggered. No problem. However the dishes came altogether. When we mentioned this to the waitress she said the kitchen was too small for us to have a starter first and then a main dish! Food nothing spectacular and not very warm either.

The view from terrace is amazing (even though the space outside is limited to a very small part of the roofbar).

The guy downstairs was not very helping but fortunately we found a very efficient and kind girl from Sicily upstairs who found a table for us and looked after us with smile and good manners. She is the only reason why I have given 2 stars and not 1. When we sat the waiters forgot an order and were not focused on tables: we had to struggle to call for ordering.

After being greeted at the downstairs reception, (and a quick telephone confirmation upstairs), we were in the elevator and on our way. The doors open, and there was the first of many (authentic!) smiles. The employees were all, without exception, very friendly! We were brought out to the terrace and soaked in the 5-star atmosphere. - Many people who have written negative reviews either didn\u2019t reserve a table, or, quite frankly, did not realize that this is a prime London location. If you\u2019re wearing a tshirt and shorts, carrying a backpack after sweating in the tube, I would think you wouldn\u2019t be seated on the terrace next to an ambassador or international business-people. You don\u2019t need a tux, but \u201edress to impress\u201c! (At least \u201ecasual-chic\u201c.) Cocktails: \u201eLa Dolce Vita\u201c = wow, \u2026 but a word of warning about the aromatic and delicious \u201eCiao, Amore!\u201c Unbeknownst to us, the glass is sprinkled on the outside with a fine dust of chocolate powder. The condensation from the cold glass has a \u201eliquifying\u201c effect on the outside, leaving melted chocolate on your hands. if your not careful, (which I wasn\u2019t) there will be a happy little accident on your face, or on your clothes. A warning from the staff when serving this piece of art would be very helpful. Food: If you order the yummy \u201eChicken & Avocado Chopped Salad\u201c, be aware that there are (a lot of) cashews on top. Better yet, just let the staff know about what you\u2019re allergic too before you order. \u201eThe Rooftop\u201c has a wonderful view, an unforgettable vibe, and authentically(!) friendly staff.

We stayed in London and for our first night there, I reserved a table so that we could eat and have a nice romantic dinner overlooking London. After arriving on the top floor, the host tells us that it is starting to rain so we don't want to be outside and that he could set us up inside. I thought they would have areas inside that also have a view and thought well this will work out even better. It did not. He sat us where we did not have a view of anything in a less than ordinary spot. Not the idea for a romantic dinner date I had in mind. We waited for quite a while before someone finally came to take our order. We looked at the drinks to which we do not find anything that tempts us for the exorbitant prices they have listed. The menu is limited: burger, fish & chips, ribeye steak for $35, or a salad. I got the burger which was OK, but certainly not worth $15. Wife got the fish & chips that she could not continue to eat, and we paid a bunch of money to then leave to go somewhere else to actually get something good to eat for supper. On our way out, we look outside on the terrace which is full of people enjoying the night views on a non-rainy rooftop terrace. The host had even brought some of them blankets to help keep them warm on an otherwise cool night. We were well-dressed for our date night, so I am not sure what was the host's problem. We decided to give the place another shot for breakfast. We were sat for breakfast in the same room - no view - for breakfast. We had opted for the Full English Breakfast which was $25, but included on a' la carte item you could order as well as the buffet offered. After waiting for about 15 minutes trying to flag someone down to come take our order for the a' la carte and coffee we wanted. Finally, I grabbed a waiter walking through the room and asked him to take our order which he did. But he never brought our coffee. I then found one guy that appeared to be the manager and asked him for the coffee which he brought. The buffet offered a pretty good assortment of items but all were OK; nothing special. The a' la carte food was good. Finally, we finished eating a average breakfast for a huge price tag with no view and terrible service.

Prior to meeting I ordered a burger with no cheese. Eventually the meal rocked up but burger had cheese. Not the end of the world and they subsequently took the burger to be re done BUT left the bowl of fries!! After a further 10 minutes my burger arrived and so did my meeting. The waitress apologised and that was that. I put the meal in the next table (untouched) having told the waitress that it doesn\u2019t matter and I will get something later. She decided to simply leave the burger and fries in the table next to me. Failing to clean up during the 50 minute meeting. Once my client had gone she very kindly came over and offered \u201cto re-heat\u201d the burger. I was obviously gobsmacked and simply assumed her pigeon English meant she meant to say she would get another fresh burger. Five minutes later a re-heated burger and a mixed bowl of cold and fresh chips arrived. I was lost for words", "date_of_review": "3 April 2019"}

The rooftop is small so this is presumably why a security deposit is taken. Cocktails are pricey and yes, there is a service charge but this is a premium central London bar with a lovely view of the skyline. This certainly isn\u2019t a run of the mill kind of bar. All other London rooftop bars come with a price tag and a service charge, you pay for what you get.  Staff were friendly and provided blankets to keep cosy whilst sat outside.  I had a great time at the rooftop st James taking in the views and having a great cocktail. I actually thought it was good value for money. I would recommend this bar and hope to return soon.

When arriving we was taken to the bar at the back of the rooftop that has very little view of London, was not aware that there was 2 parts to the rooftop bar. One with a view and one without so not a good Start, would have thought that when booking a table that would ensure you had one with a view and this is something that you should be made aware of when booking that you may not get a table with a view. Ordered some drinks Easter special and a Nearly 310. And a bottle of processco , The Easter special looks nice a bit sweet for my taste, the Nearly 310 yet again a bit sweet and I could not taste the Rum in it at all. The worst thing was the bottle of Processco was served warm which in a 5star Hotel is not acceptable,  1. I do not understand why the bottles would be stored in a warm location 2. I do not understand why any Barman would think it\u2019s acceptable to serve a warm bottle. 3. Why the Waitress thought it was acceptable to open and pour 2 glasses out when she must have felt that bottle was not chilled This is very poor service from the bar staff and you wonder how well they have been trained. We complained and another bottle was brought over this was colder still not as cold as I would expect but just about drinkable, we complained about this and the fact we did not have a table in the area that we thought we had booked and after a few minutes we was moved to the nice part of the rooftop terrace and now had a view. Ordered a spiced espresso martini and a Mojito I had the martini had a nice taste of the spiced rum. But the foam on the top had what tastes like ice crystals init not what I would expect at all once these had melted it was quite a nice drink Ordered some food Chicken Karage buns, Salmon Bread, Artichoke Flatbread, Fries. All nice if quite small portions for the money charged. Then had a Bye Bye Ben and Toast Larger, The Cocktail this time we a excellent nicely flavoured the grapefruit bitters working well with the Gin, My Mate really liked the larger so at least we had one good drink. The View from the rooftop section of the bar we ended up in was fantastic, but I felt the service was slow there only seemed to be 2 waiters working which is not enough for the amount of tables in this section , we had to keep asking for the drinks menu as its not left on the table, we also seemed to be the only table that didn\u2019t get any nibbles put out with our drinks. We\u2019d spoke to a lady called Pau ?? Who I believe was the under manager on call this evening and the help from her was amazing it was because of her we did not end up walking out when the warm processco was served up, we brought all these issues up with her nad she was the one who ensured we got moved to the nice part of the bar and ensured the cost of the bottle of processco was taken of the bill, she is a asset to the Hotel was very apologetic about our issues. I have drunk in many of the best cocktail bars in London. The Dandylyan, The Rumpus Room, The Ned, Bar Swift, The American Bar. The Beaufort Bar to name a few and these are all in a different league to the bar here. The View is worth going for but that\u2019s about all I can recommend it for", "date_of_review": "21 April 2019"}

We were facing a building and could see Trafalgar sq out of the corner of my eye,there were sliding glass windows in front of us which made no difference once opened as the view was still of the side of a building.  We were sat there 20 minutes before a very moody waiter walked past and I asked him if we had to go up to the bar to order, he said no and hesitantly took our order. Drinks are also around \u00a315 each which i wouldn't have minded paying if there was a nice view and atmosphere but there wasn't.

(until...) First visit at the rooftop: We dined in Chinatown and then walked by the Rooftop and stopped in on the odd chance that there would be a table. There was! Drinks and nibbles were reasonably priced, and as it got chilly, staff brings around blanket for the guests. (if you have a good waiter/waitress. We did not). If I had to rate this first visit, I would still say it was a FIVE. We enjoyed ourselves so much that we stopped by concierge on our way out so we could make a reservation for our last evening in London to celebrate this trip. Our reservation confirmation arrived by email. Our final evening we checked in with the concierge and were allowed to take the lift upstairs. (yes, you do stop and get permission before riding up). We were then greeted and asked if we could sit on the railing, which is a bar like area with the most direct views over the glass. We were told that not only could we not sit there, but there was no seating at all out on the rooftop. (Huh?!) We explained that we had a reservation and were told that having one did not necessarily guarantee we would be sitting outside. Isn't that the whole point?? We were taken to an inside area with ZERO views and told that we could walk outside and take photos if we liked but had to leave our drinks inside. After expressing our disappointment, there was still no apology, just a reiteration of the fact that a reservation did not guarantee we would be outside. Well...they certainly should tell you that when you make a reservation. When there is a service failure, the mark of good service is how to make it right. They could have offered a little in the way of compensation...perhaps comp one drink or a small nibble. That may or may not have altered our decision to stay. When nothing was forthcoming, we made our decision to leave. Clearly, we expected better from a property of this caliber.", "date_of_review": "15 September 2018"}

I first tried to visit this place with my girlfriend on a summer evening and was told there would be a 2-hour wait so we gave up. I decided to visit again for a second time tonight, 9pm on a Wednesday evening. The bar downstairs was literally empty, so we thought we might have better luck finding some space at the rooftop bar as well.  The reception guy could not reach the bar staff on the phone, so when a couple left while we were waiting, he just prompted us to use the lift to get to the bar. When we arrived upstairs, there was nobody at the (second) reception area, so we went on to sit on one of the available tables outside. Indeed the views looked very nice, with a summery vibe and a partial view of the London Eye.  In about 2 minutes, a young gentleman (can't tell if he was the host or a waiter, most probably the former) asked if he could help us. We asked if we can order and he said yes, so we went on and ordered 2 glasses of wine. Then he paused for a while and asked how many of us would be. I said that a friend might join us, as I was waiting for his response - the table had 4 seats and it was 2 of us so far. And then the magic happened: He just said the table was reserved and we should go either inside (!) or go to another terrace at the back, which many other reviews have described, that was empty and without any character or views. Under different circumstances we might have stayed, but I just didn't understand how we were told this only after we placed our orders? So we left, obviously, as I didn't want to make a scene. Now, reading the rest of the reviews I don't understand how you cannot reserve a specific table outside when you make a booking, and despite that, our table was specifically reserved for someone else, at 9pm, on a Wednesday night.. It kind of sounded lame and made me feel like I was unwanted for some reason. Luckily I have been to many similar establishments in London or New York, so I don't think it was something about me specifically, rather than most probably our choice of drinks which would result to a lower bill than eg. 2 cocktails and dinner. I am completely discouraged to try to visit this place again - not to worry I guess, it's in a very touristy area so there's always going to be demand for it, which is why they can get away with this attitude.  Good luck who those who try it - for the rest, there's plenty of rooftops around (even had a better experience at Radio Rooftop Bar, which I rank very very low in terms of service and attitude).", "date_of_review": "3 October 2018"}

Ordered the salmon flatbread and it was tasteless (\u00a310) and grilled aubergine (\u00a38) was tiny and it seemed to have been reheated in a microwave. The staff were just wondering around looking to the floor avoiding eye contact. It did not appear to be someone in charge and waiters just gathered behind the bar chatting to each other and ignoring their customers who were waiting to be served. The table next to us just walked out after waiting long time... The main part of the bar is very nice, overlooking the square but it was fully booked and the back room (where we were) was empty without character or atmosphere with just some random plastic olive tress with Christmas lights (in August).

We decided to do that and ordered a bottle of wine to pass the time. After half hour they said we had a table but we could only have it for 45 minutes. We decided to go with it and were told to settle our bar bill downstairs first which we did for \u00a350. Upon exiting the lift on the top floor we were taken past the terrace with the views over Trafalgar Square (the view we were waiting for!) but we were taken to an empty room at the back by the kitchen! We expressed disappointment and asked (a) why we were told we had to wait 90 minutes and (b) why did we only have a 45 minute slot? Nothing added up. After all we gave it ten minutes and drank up and left but not without quizzing the concierge first (who was busy telling others to have a drink at the bar). It became very clear that what they get you (and possibly hundreds of similarly duped tourists) to do is run up a bill in the lounge bar first because when they take you up stairs nobody wants to stay for a drink given that the area at the back is without character and without a view but for a turnover of many other people scratching their heads expressing disappointment but not before running up a \u00a350 bill in the waiting area down stairs. If this was a bank you could probably sue them for misleading; misrepresentation; breach of faith and probably theft. Regretfully though there is no recourse other than to ponder on how we, and no doubt countless others, are royally ripped off. Disgraceful.

We had a two hour time slot starting at 7pm. We arrived 10 mins early & were told they had had private function & were setting up. They told us to have drink in bar downstairs while waiting & they would call us. (Very expensive bar downstairs \u00a320 for two wines, which we were not allowed to take to roof top bar) They never did & we had to chase a few times. Went in about half hour late but they said they would extend our slot which they did. Ordered a lamb (belly, \u00a310) snack which took over an hour to arrive but once it did it was amazing. After we wanted to order lamb cutlets (starter) but our allocated time slot was running out. They said it was fine & no time pressure. Just as well as that took another hour to arrive. Had to chase a few times & in the end they did not charge us for it. We ended up staying most of the night & left at 11pm so worked out really well. Staff were very friendly & helpful.

Think it would be nice if the staff knew what the buildings were from the views. Not cheap but think for what you get with views it is well worth it. Bottle of wine starts around \u00a330.

The table was booked for 6 people and when they arrived it was only set for 4. Myself and my partner arrived a little later than the time the table was booked for and whilst our friends were enjoying their time on the rooftop, we were stood downstairs in reception for no less than 20 minutes waiting to be let up. When we arrived at the rooftop, we were squeezed through a tiny door to our friends. There was only one spare seat and with two empty tables next to us, we took a stool from there to use. A member of staff approached us and told us we weren't allowed to use that seat as there was a reservation on that table and we were to put it back. We asked for an alternative seat to be found, of which we were told they would go and get one from the other side of the bar... another 20 minutes later, one of us was still standing and so we took the seat from the table that had been 'reserved' anyway. We had bought 4 bottles of wine, a couple rounds of cocktails along with some food which arrived in dribs and drabs (all equating to around \u00a3500) when Ashley (manager number one) came over to us and said that they had had a complaint from a guest of noise. Whilst we understood, his tone was completely unacceptable and, we felt, rude and aggressive. Later on, after continual scowls from the staff for having an enjoyable evening, we were told that we were still too loud and that it was unacceptable and that we would be asked to leave without finishing our drinks (that we had paid for) if we continued. This in our eyes was completely out of order and we disputed this with him. He then raised his voice to a member of our party and went off to find Cameron (manager number two). Cameron came over and told us that we had been abusive towards manager number one and that we were being given 5 minutes to finish our drinks and leave (at this point we still had a bottle of wine on the table and a round of cocktails). We finished what we could of our drinks and left the venue, going on to a bar in Soho which was, by far, cheaper, less pretentious and with staff that appreciated the customers opinions. Reading the reviews, it seems like this is a VERY common occurrence and whilst each comment has its own templated response of 'we will look into this' I don't feel that ANYTHING is being done about the abysmal, disgusting attitude of those working/managing this venue. We will never be visiting this bar again and have spoken to two separate parties who were considering booking, advising them not to. I would advise the General Manager to seriously look into and consider this issue as continual bad reviews and situations like this will cause a huge downturn. The spot is stunning with the views over London, but this is not enough to ride on the back of if the value, service and attitude of those working there is not dealt with.

Asked why the slow service and was told that that evening there was only one barman (it was Friday).... Very bad vibe in this bar, music was also uninspiring.  We paid our bill (\u00a320 - really?) and gazed at the (then closed pub next door) wishing we had made different plans...

I made a reservation, but no one except for reception asked for it. Communication between reception and rooftop was not existing: although we were told at reception that our table is ready, the waiter at the rooftop was unprepared for us and was not aware of our reservation. We were placed at the back of the restaurant with no view and had to wait over an hour until we were able to move to the nice part. The waitress said that not a single table got free in that period, which is hard to believe for a Friday night between 9 and 10pm (considering the 2hour restriction per table). I understand that there are only limited places on the balcony, but the advertisement is completely misleading. Also, the waitress was not friendly when she explained that we cannot move. Moreover, service was really bad and totally unorganised. There was no clear organisation and no one seemed to know who is in charge of what. Accordingly, there were many complaints and long waiting. We ordered a G&T and a cocktail: The G&T came, but we waited 10 more minutes for the cocktail! Not appropriate in a hotel like that. Drinks are too expensive. Overall not worth the money.

A booking that clearly no member of the staff other than this one girl was aware of and she decided to conveniently blame it on the booking system?

We turned up early on a Saturday afternoon but were still allowed up and sat in the conservatory for a short while but were soon moved out to the balcony area and left at our allotted time. It was nice we weren't rushed out, however service was unreliable to say the least. We had several offers to take our order as we first arrived but hadn't been given menus, once we had decided what we wanted there was no-one around. When we finally ordered the 7 drinks, they took an eternity to arrive such that we asked twice where they were and then the most straight forward vodka lime and lemonade took a further two asks. At no point were we asked if we wanted more drinks, we always had to accost someone and then wait an age for them to arrive. Probably just as well given the price of them but on a bright sunny day, we definitely would have consumed more. When the bill came up, we had been charged for 4 drinks we never had. Once pointed out, they were removed without issue but I'd be interested how many people just pay without checking.

But Hilton Corporation perhaps you need to remind yourself that you are a global hotel brand and NOT a deeply boutique bar.  I get that you need to restrict access to reservations only. But don't then have a check in desk where you have to wait whilst the receptionist spends 5 minutes on a work call unrelated to the rooftop bar. All she had to do was check a name and reservation for heavens sake ( and this performance was repeated 3 times across our party of 4). Next up - if you are going to close half of the outdoor section to make a Hilton promotional video ( in this case with \"Bastille\" on 9 June) then at least have the courtesy to warn of this both at the time of booking AND on arrival. Had we known in advance we'd have gone elsewhere - but nothing. That said watching some overwrought and over important \"luvvies\" stressing over camera angles was rather amusing. And to be fair to the film crew, they had the courtesy to apologise for the disruption they were causing to us, unprompted. Not a word came from Hilton staff until I complained. Unfortunately our waitress from the bar had presumably spent the morning sucking on lemons and pulling out her own fingernails judging by her face and manner. But let's also call out some positives that suggest how good this location could be. The food, whilst expensive, was very good. The waitress who served the food ( whose name sadly I didn't get) was charming. To aid in positive identification for very positive service, she was of Afro-Carribean heritage - and delightful.  When I complained to \" the lemon sucker\" about the constant interruptions to our lunch, she offered to knock the DISCRETIONERY service charge off the bill. Wow - customer service hits a new low! So step in - at my insistence - duty manager Aziz, who was extremely apologetic, very understanding and generally very impressive. We quickly reached an accommodation over a reasonable reduction to the bill, for which I thank him. So what a great location let down by poor business practice on arrival; corporate arrogance; and one very miserable staff member. That really is somewhat pathetic for a brand like Hilton. Clone Aziz and our food waitress - re-engineer a customer friendly check-in proceed - and put your customers first rather than treat them as an afterthought - and this can be a great venue.", "date_of_review": "11 June 2018"}

To top it off, they are super-expensive. Be warned!  There are far friendlier bars, that do better mixed drinks, pretty much everywhere else around. ", "date_of_review": "26 May 2018"}

We turn up, can they fit us in, do we have a reservation? no, we'll see if we can fit you in, oh thanks, it appears they can accommodate us which is nice seeing as how the restaurant is half empty, perhaps we could just have been waved up and in but no we have to go through the front desk rigmarole. Fair enough this is Piccadilly after all. \"I want to show the view\" he says but as we turn to step onto the balcony we are told that unfortunately it will not be possible to let us take our lunch there as there is a private function, we were allowed to step out briefly and the view is magnificent. Ah well, we take a table, order drinks which come promptly. I ask for some water with my whisky and am given a glass of water, perhaps there are no jugs available and I'm a dab hand with glass manipulation so I manage manfully not to spill a drop> We are then left alone for a while, quite a while, quite a long while. I appreciate this non pushy waitering style but now i'm getting hungry. So we order, my nephew informs me that the black cod is worth a go and so I agree, lets have it. We chat, we catch up, we drink, we order more drink and realise the meal has not arrived, we have been here half an hour, the waiter checks for us and also I overhear for the table next to us and suddenly the food is with us. I am slightly confused as I am confronted with 3 one inch square pieces of black cod. I look at my nephew, is this a starter or a main course I inquire, he doesn't know, he tells me that last time he came there was a lot more fish on the plate. I ask the waiter. He is not sure so he enquires and returns with the news that this is indeed the main course. I am bemused. The portions are the size of dice set nicely upon 3 strands of grated carrot and a flower of some kind. Is this a new trend I ask my companion, is this a homeopathic restaurant where we are given a brief taste of what the food could be? It is absolutely delicious but at \u00a340 odd a plate I would expect it to be. I snuck a look at his bill, naughty I know but I was fascinated. We decided that we were still hungry and so at 1.55pm we asked if we could order something else. No. What? No the kitchen is not taking new orders, they are dealing with a private function on the balcony and so no more food is available. But those people over there are ordering food? the waiter shrugs. I eavesdrop on the two tables next to me. A waiter has just delivered them 2 plates which they are refusing. they point out that it has taken so long for these dishes to arrive that they assumed they had been forgotten and so they are not interested. The waiter has a hard time understanding their point of view but eventually she takes the food back. At the same time the table behind me asks if they can have their food which coincidentally as luck would have it is the same dish as the tardy food that has been returned. I watch a brief conversation between two waiters and then that very food is presented to the table behind me, they fall on it with cries of delight and relief. Meantime the other table is still discussing their experience, I am tempted to join in but then realise I am too hungry to make any sense, so we leave and I visit a local sushi because the taste of black cod has whetted my appetite. I inquire as to whether my high-spending nephew will be bringing his clients here again. \"I fear not uncle\" he says with a charming smile, \"I fear not. the area is awash with fine dining opportunities\"", "date_of_review": "23 May 2018"}

We ordered prosecco and a couple of cocktails (recommend the chocolate and cherry!) and were well attended to by Justin who was serving our table. The cocktails came promptly and were dangerously good!! During our drinks Karim occasionally popped over to check how everything was, which was a lovely touch given it was our first visit here. The ambiance was just right, they do not over crowd the rooftop which helps give it an exclusive and comfortable feel.

I was shocked that the waitress instead of saying sorry to the other couple who already had had drinks at another table, told us the table was no longer available and just because we booked a table does not mean you will get one. Despite my complaints we were offered a table out the way in a cold in heated area or to add salt to our wounds could have the other couples table they did not want. Turned out this other couple were not even hotel guest, but had just come for a drink, I can only assume friends of the waitress. When I tried to complain none of the staff actually cared at all.
