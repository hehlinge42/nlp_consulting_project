The food is very expensive and the portion size is very small.  The staff were not very attentive at all and were very pre-occupied with other matters such as talking or standing around.  I was sat there for 1 hour after my plate had been collected and not one member of staff out of 5 asked whether I needed another drink or whether I wanted to see the desert menu - this was in an empty restaurant!

Picked the pod as I wanted it to be special. The pod itself is cute, but very disappointingly furnished and quite bare. It felt like being in a cheap restaurant with just the outdated table and chairs in middle + the heater and a couple of fake candles in a lantern which were not even on. On top of it the door to the pod kept getting stuck, my boyfriend has to kick it open for the waiter to get in at some point!  There we no blankets as there is usually in pods like this one, and the heating in it wasn't all that. The table was not set prior to our arrival either - the waiter who looked poorly trained took few minutes setting the table as we sat there waiting. He also kept leaving the door to the pod open every time he came in to the pod which defies the idea of being warm outdoors! He was not rude but he was obviously not well trained and kept forgetting the order to mistaking what we asked for.  The rooftop view is ok but nothing too special. It's on top of a hotel which is outdated and needs renovation. Maybe I should have researched th hotel too before booking. We opted for a bottle of midrange wine which I hadn't tried before at \u00a356 - it was more of an overpriced cheap bottle in reality. The food was ok - nothing special apart from the steak which in fairness was amazing. At the price of \u00a3160 for 2 ppl, I've had amazing dining experiences- this for sure was not one of them and left me quite deflated as it was a surprise dinner for my boyfriend's birthday.

From a Covid perspective, the igloo felt quite safe. We were very surprised how crowded the restaurant was inside, so we were happy to be in a bubble outside away from everyone. The igloo had beautiful views over the city and we were comfortably warm throughout the evening. Service was stellar. I guess the biggest letdown was the food. My tuna starter was lovely, but the beef cheek was dry and not flavorful. The side dish of carrots was tasty, but the new potatoes were boring and uninventive. My husband thought his terrine starter was flavorful but lacking accompaniments of bread, but loved his main dish of bream. The chocolate cheesecake also did not work from a flavor perspective, and the restaurant added a strange glob of fruit mixture to my husband\u2019s sticky toffee pudding. I was also annoyed when I ordered a martini and the glass was not even half full, and my husband\u2019s first beer was flat.  We also found it odd that they added a service charge to the bill (which we expected), but then asked for additional money at the end to cover the \u201cserver tip.\u201d What does the service charge cover then? All in all, we were happy to do something different during a tough year, but the whole experience was just ok. It was an expensive evening and we wouldn\u2019t do it again just for the experience of dining in a glass bubble.", "date_of_review": "12 December 2020"}

The lady said yeh. but she looked really uncomfortable talking to us as if she did not have the time for a conversation. it felt rushed. So I and my partner went outside and took pictures. I was outside for 10 minutes max but realized there were at least 5 tables free. we stood by a bar table which was free the whole time we were outside.

He and the manager really paid attention to us, made sure we were topped up with drinks, presented our food beautiful and was so friendly and went the extra mile to make the night special. They reserved a table for us at the bar for after drinks when dinner was done (so we didn\u2019t feel rushed to leave). Also I have to send compliments to the chef! Husband is a chef so going out to eat is always hard but he thoroughly enjoyed his meal and the flavours as did I! Sea bream cooked to perfection husband\u2019s steak cooked beautifully also. Starters where delicious also. Thank you  Setup of the igloo, restaurant and bar were both beautiful! Romantic and chic establishment. Thank you to the entire team for your wonderful service and creating a beautiful experience for us. Would definitely recommend and will be back here again. ", "date_of_review": "12 August 2020"}

The place is ok, nothing special, and it is a pity that the balcony closes at 10pm. What is unbelievable is the quality of the food. One of the poorest price/quality ratios in London. The meat (tried both the short ribs and a steak) was chewy, the chips (hard to get them wrong) were the poorest quality frozen ones, the fish (cod with rosti) was overcooked and the rosti was burnt, leaving a very sour taste in your mouth, and the list could keep going.....

From the very moment we stepped into the aviary we were made to feel unwelcome. We were abruptly greeted by a host who looked to be the manager who told us that our breakfast was downstairs, however when we said we wanted to pay the supplement he again said \u201cyour breakfast is downstairs\u201d. Once he finally understood that we were willing to pay for our breakfast, he told us to wait at the end of the bar with no further explanation... we didn\u2019t know where we would end up having breakfast!  After a 5-10 minute wait a female host went through the same list of questions before seating us at a table - making us feel very unwelcome. It\u2019s also worth noting that we heard the staff talk to other guests in the same way. After waiting for a considerably long time and making eye contact with every single member of staff, no one came to take our order so we decided to go and take a look at the buffet option.  We were honestly appalled to see the bare minimum of food - there was a dish with one sausage, no beans and no eggs, oh and also no plates! Considering this was a \u00a322 breakfast we were absolutely shocked and decided to leave because it clearly isn\u2019t worth your time or the money. It\u2019s also worth noting that only half the restaurant was open... hardly being rushed off their feet. The hotel staff heard of our issue and said they\u2019d be in touch as they seemed shocked too, nearly a week later and we\u2019ve heard nothing. Would avoid this place.

Loved the fur covered seats, mini fireplace, little lights and lamps dotted around... plus the blankets giving it that real Christmassy feel :) Our waitress, I think her name was Federica (sorry if I've got it wrong!) and another waiter (I didn't catch his name) were both very attentive without being intrusive.  The nibbles that came with my booking were more than enough for the two of us and were lovely! My only comment would be to have a bit more of a mixture in the bar menu as we found of a lot of the nibbles were dry items (i.e pitta bread, croquettes, almond nuts, arancini).

There were several patio heaters dotted about so it was lovely and warm and the igloos looked really cosy for a meal. At 10pm we were made to go inside as this is when the roof terrace closed, which is a real shame I think as we would have loved to have stayed outside for longer. But we perched ourselves at the bar and really enjoyed watching the bar staff make the cocktails and answer any questions we had about them. The Bloody Mary cocktail was very nice!

We wanted a nice rooftop restaurant to celebrate at and my aunty booked us in here. We arrived bang on time and was asked if we wanted to have a drink on the terrace first which we said would be lovely. Our first round of drinks were \u00a333 for 4 drinks which consisted of 2 large wines and 2 beers so as you can see drinks were not cheap but then guess this is pretty standard for London and especially rooftop bars. Views were stunning, the sun was just setting so it looks beautiful. We spent about 20 minutes outside and then went in to eat. We were greeted well and were seated at a table by the window which was lovely. We all decided what we were going to eat and the men had decided on the pork chop but when the waitress came to take the order we were told that this was the only thing on the menu that they did not have. Men were gutted as this is what they really fancied but they opted for the chicken instead. They said that it was nice but nothing overwhelming. I had the lamb rump which was nice but as i couldn't have some of the accompaniments (due to intolerances) they gave me a side dish of potatoes instead but it was really small and I was still absolutely starving after i had finished my meal. As I cannot tolerate sugar very well I cannot have puddings so it meant I left the restaurant very hungry which is not great when you have spent \u00a325 on a meal. I emailed the restaurant a few days before going to explain about being gluten free and some other food intolerances i have but no one got back to me which was dissapointing. I have to eat gluten free and there are quite a few options available and i am sure they would tweek recipes if they could. The staff were lovely, the service was good but this only gets a 3 star rating from me for the simple fact they did not have what the men wanted, the chicken was average and I left hungry. I probably wouldn't return, I would try another roof top restaurant instead.", "date_of_review": "26 September 2019"}

My wife\u2019s chicken salad was a substantial dish; my steak frites comprised a chunky mound of sliced bavette, perfect chips in a basket, a good peppercorn sauce. We went off piste ordering a filet of salmon and chips for my daughter, but at a staggering \u00a324 was only \u00a31 less than the set three course menu also including salmon albeit with leeks in a consomm\u00e9. Neither of the two beers on tap I had ordered were available but I was given a bottle of Weissbeer on the house. Coffee came with complimentary petits fours.", "date_of_review": "12 October 2019"}

Upon arrival the manager seated us promptly but from there it just went downhill. Once seated I ordered a cappuccino and orange juice from our waiter and my husband ordered an Americano. Twenty minutes later the server had still not returned with our beverages nor to take our order! I had to ask 3 times before our coffees finally arrived. I told the inept waiter that I was still waiting on my juice and he said it was coming shortly. It never did so 10 minutes later I helped myself to a glass from the buffet. I expected he would\u2019ve at least been gracious enough to not charge for it but alas not so. Then the food arrived and all I can say is, it was what I would\u2019ve expected at a roadside diner. My husband ordered fried eggs and toast. The eggs were over cooked, the toast was a slice of very thin bland cheap white bread. There was not a single garnishing on the plate, not even a slice of tomato or sprig of greens to cheer up the plate. I ordered the eggs benedict. It tasted fine but completely average and again no garnishing other than a piece of wilted watercress. It looked tired and unappetising. This meagre meal and shocking service cost a whopping \u00a337. The restaurant is clearly understaffed as evidenced by a frazzled manager who was doing his best trying to get the waiters to speed up. I overheard one waiter complaining to the manager he was too busy and would not take on any more tables. Very unprofessional.

On a gorgeous summers day it really is the perfect roof terrace to take in the delights on London. With it's comfy outdoor sofas, high-rise tables and outdoor bar it really makes for a very charming setting. The service however is incredibly slow. On my first visit I thought this must just be a once off. However, several visits later and the serve is still shockingly slow, and this is even on days when the weather has been less that favourable, so it hasn't been as busy. Service is sped-up a little with the outdoor table service, but in all honesty I think they just need to employ more staff. Despite the slow service, the staff are friendly and knowledgable about the range of drinks and cocktails on offer and I certainly don't let it put me off going. I wouldn't rush in the winter months though, as it really is the outdoor terrace that makes Aviary. The inside of the bar is like any other London bar, with incredibly loud music, they just have a better view.

It was me (woman) and my male friend who had dinner together.  It was me who booked the table, and I also wrote in the booking that it was a birthday dinner for the guy.  During the dinner when my friend was asked if he wanted another drink, he looked at me and asked \"if it's ok?\" (I mean, the waiter could see that he asked me).  When we were ready to pay, (I) asked the server for the bill. And before he went away (I) also asked if they take cash.  And still, when the waiter came back with the bill, he put it straight down on the other side of the table, right in front of my guy friend, when it was me who was gonna pay it all.  Not that anything should make the waiter assume wich one in the company will pay. But if he now wanted to assume that one of us is paying it all, there was NOTHING telling that it was on the guy. Except that he's a guy and I'm a woman.  I've worked as a waitress myself and think there's nothing more right to always put the bill in the middle. You have no reason to assume which one is gonna pay. To put the bill in front of the man with no reason is just nothing more than pure sexism.

At 39 for a small steak with no sides and 17 for a burger, this is unacceptable - either the chef is incompetent or the kitchen is under-staffed. Both tables either side of us complained about their food. One had the cost removed from their bill, with the other table the waiter just stormed off without responding (after asking how the food was).

Perhaps they should take these down in February going forward so there is more space on the outdoor terrace.  Be careful if you are ordering drinks. If you would like a single spirit you will need to specify this as the bar men will just pour you a double even if you didn\u2019t ask for it. I have also noticed that prices vary each time you order a drink from varying barmen, seems like they just charge whatever they want.  Drinks are quite over priced when there are many other bars in the area but I guess you are paying extra for the location and view.

Due to the open, island layout of the bar (which looks great, by the way), there are many areas one can queue for a drink. I stood close to two of the bartenders and patiently waited for over thirty minutes to be served two cocktails. This would not have been such an issue if it wasn't for the fact that several customers that queued after me were served first ! It took another unfortunate couple next to me to complain to one of the bar staff before our existence was acknowledged. No apology from any of the staff for the wait, but I appreciated this at last got the attention of the bartenders. The drinks looked very presentable but did not deliver on flavour (one tasted like cold tomato soup, the other had a lot of rosemary added which overpowered the drink). Not sure if it was just our bad experience that soured the taste. The best part of the visit was the view, it's a great location and the lighting/decor really adds to the relaxed vibe of the place. I am trying to make this a positive and constructive review but I find it difficult to excuse the service I experienced.

Ordered the chateaubriand with hispi cabbage and blue cheese and some dauphinoise potatoes. We were told it would take around 30 minutes to cook and the waitress suggested we enjoyed the views from the terrace while we waited for the main course. Unfortunately this backfired a bit as we spent the whole time waiting in the queue to get outside before our server came back to tell us our food was ready. The steak was very nice and cooked to our liking, the potatoes were a bit bland and the hispi cabbage was really tender but could use a little bit more blue cheese. A manager cleared our table and we asked for the dessert menu. After that nobody offered any more drinks nor did we receive the desert menu. As we did not want to spoil the rest of the evening after waiting for a fair amount of time we asked for the bill and settled it. This could have been so much better of aN experience however we must have came there on wrong day. Eventually we made it to the terrace and the view was really nice they also have dining pods there which seemed to be popular. Overall nice place but would rather go to Madison's.", "date_of_review": "5 April 2019"}

However on the evening we visited it was freezing and damp so we came inside and ordered a bottle of wine. But where to sit? Nowhere free and 3 corners of the bar cordoned off for private parties. So in order to enjoy our wine at a leisurely pace and in comfort we decided we'd eat in the restaurant. Good plan we thought but unfortunately we found the food rather bland. Staff were pleasant enough and the decor is nice. But as we left we noticed that both the bar and cafe/restaurant on the ground floor were also cordoned off for reserved parties. Perhaps we were just victims of the hotel's obvious success as a reception venue. It is obviously better than average but based on this visit I'd say good rather than very good.", "date_of_review": "18 February 2019"}

It is a quality location with really good food. The view from the deck is not especially dramatic though. Getting to Aviary means taking the lift to the 9th floor then climbing another set of steps to the restaurant. The place is busy of a weeknight evening but not full. The ambience is good but not buzzing.  The atmosphere is appealing thanks to well thought out lighting which adds to the appeal. The place looks good and has a touch of class about it.  Seating is comfortable but there is only just enough space between tables. The dining environment is pleasant though and benefits from this place not being too raucous of a weeknight. There is a vegetarian option for both starter and main. The starter of fritters with a type of chutney is excellent. The combination is delicious and the texture is perfect. A nice entree. A main course of risotto was ok. Not as good as the starter for sure. There was not much other than the risotto rice on the plate and it was coated in a bland sauce. A side of potato dauphinois was superb. It was a magnificent and creamy version of the dish with a pleasant combination of textures. Definitely worth the addition. Dessert was fantastic. A rhubarb trifle with whisky cream tasted as good as it sounded. The portion size was decent and the combination was delectable. Unfortunately one of the main attractions of Aviary did not live up to expectations. The rooftop view is boring. This is not one of the more interesting angles London can be viewed at. It certainly is not as photogenic as might be imagined. The deck itself is nice. The pods which presumably are the avian theme look odd but they are at least eye catching. Price is not extortionate considering the location on top of a luxury hotel. It is not a cheap eat but is definitely not ridiculous. Service was patient and generally attentive. There was a sense of respect in the interactions. As a place to eat Aviary is mixed but when it gets it right the outcome is simply delicious. The view though is disappointing.", "date_of_review": "5 March 2019"}

However the lady host went straight away to get the manager who came over and took our order straight away. The food was amazing!

On another note, something that I should have checked prior to booking, the vegetarian options were not incredibly exciting (2 options).

The ambience was great and the venue feels very special. The views are fantastic and the outdoor terrace despite being winter was a winner and very cosy. The food really let us down I had the burger which was absolutely horrendous! The meat was substandard quality and was not cooked well at all, with the high standard of burgers on offer across London this talked a good game but was a complete let down, I did not finish my meal. Other diners looked to have wonderful meals so perhaps I chose the wrong option. My friend opted for a veggie dish which was also a little bland and not something she would pick again.

After our breakfast we sat outside enjoying the wonderful views from the open terrace; atmosphere was chilled and staff was always around and on top for anything else we needed. Afterwards we were mainly served by a Spanish chap called Alejandro, who confirmed that the service was still impeccable hours after. Well, I don't think there's much else to add.

Prices weren't too bad either and the toilets were clean with a grat view! Another strange thing.......it really wasn't busy at all. It was a Sunday afternoon and there were probably 8-10 people in total, seated at about 4/5 tables. The staff then gave us all a 10 minute warning that all the chairs were going to be removed and we could either remain standing or sit on the 'sofa' type seating?  I found this really bizarre?

Once our order was placed (Just mains, not starters), we waited a while (30mins) for our food, this was fine as the food was pleasant. What occurred during and after our food was arguably the worst service I have received. The bottle of wine we ordered for the table was topped up once throughout us sitting at the table before the end of our meal. I've no idea if I offended the waiter or if he was just more concerned with the table of 8 behind us. Paid zero attention to us, to the fact that I went to the bar to ask for my bill only to be told to go and wait at my table for our waiter....yay. Alas he did not come so my partner signalled for the manager to get our bill, we waited nearly 10 more mins. At this point the waiter brought the card machine over, threw it to me and turned away. Professional, to the point that I commented....he didn't seem bothered.

Hotel entrance even has some air hockey style games which was a nice surprise and to get to the Aviary you have to go up in the elevator and head to the reception area of the Aviary. You are greeted by a light art deco interior with glass walls and I am told the WC is worth a visit also for the glass walls. Menu was described well and wine paring also done so you get a full fine dining experience. I personally ate the chicken and dessert was shared by all.  Dress Code: Everyone looked smart as some must have come after work in the city but casual is fine as there was dress code stipulated but you may want to just dress up a little as you get some great views on the terrace and makes for some nice photos.  Booking Process: Walk in and they managed to squeeze us in but they were busy so would advice you to book.  Location: 22-25 Finsbury Square , London, EC2A 1DX Decor & Lighting: Decor is Art Deco style but not excessive and pleasant. Light and airy with space between tables so you don\u2019t just feel like a number. Wall to wall glass so lots of light pouring in but was there during daylight so cannot comment on evening light levels.  Heating and Cooling: Perfect temperature, it was a very warm summers day out and nice and airy and cool but not cold inside. Just right.  Ambience & Acoustics: Lively place and busy hence you get the usual crowd noise but although you have to raise your voice a little you can still manage to have a good conversation.  Drinks: The bar was happy to make up a mock-tail although they don\u2019t have any specific ones on the drinks menu which they should consider.  Food:  1. Longhorn beef burger, Montgomery Cheddar, 17.5 maple bacon, tomato relish, onion rings, French fries - Friend had this and said it was ok just a little dry but I cannot comment as I did not try it.  2. Roast fillet of sea bream, seaweed gnocci, 22 clams, samphire, Noilly prat liquor - Another friend had this and was impressed but again I cannot personally comment as I did not try it.  3. Chicken with corn - sorry but they had a new menu so I cannot explain the full dish in detail - Moist and cooked well with a nice base of corn and roast potatoes.  Desert: Keylime tart with sorbet - A nice dessert and really refreshed and cleansed the pallet.  Please note they have a new menu which at the time of writing this (11.06.18) was not on the internet.  Bill / Cost: \u00a3120.00 for three Conclusion: Great place to visit and we were very well looked after especially by Feri who was very attentive and offered the best service which really pushed up the score. The only let down would be the staff at the entrance I am afraid as they just did not really seem to care or explained anything to us. However the food, views and all the staff upstairs really made up for the experience. At first there were no tables available but they asked if we can give a table back within 1.5hours so they really tried to accommodate us. Highly recommend this as a place to visit if in the area and easy reach of many stations.", "date_of_review": "11 June 2018"}

Firstly we were given a very disappointing welcome by one of the security guards, who didn\u2019t greet us, surly a must in a hotel of this standard. He then proceeded to \u2018shoo\u2019 - yes \u2018shoo\u2019 us away from the lift area because we were not allowed to stand there. So apparently you\u2019re not allowed to stand in front of a lift if you\u2019re waiting for one? I understand we were a large group, but we were careful to make sure we weren\u2019t blocking the thoroughfare. He then made us feel like juvenile delinquents, interrogating us on whether we had a booking, whether or not we were legal to drink, and what name our booking was in. It wasn\u2019t a pleasant way to start the evening.  When we arrived at the restaurant, on the top floor, we had to wait 10 minutes to be seen to our table, with no offer of a seat or drink while we waited, despite booking. Luckily our table waitress was very helpful and accommodating. However, we then had to wait another 55 minutes to receive our main meals (we didn\u2019t order starters), which was appalling. The excuse given was that another large party had to be served before us. Not good enough. The food (when it eventually came) was of an excellent standard though.  Such a shame that the evening was soured by the unfriendly welcome and long wait. This certainly did not appear to be an establishment where 18 year olds are welcomed.

The daily breakfast is at Aviary which is an adequate buffet but is a little lacking in variety. The fruit is the same every day and I never saw a banana offered even though I was there for three weeks. Still there were a lot of other buffet options so overall not bad. My one issue is you just could not get them to ever come over to offer you a second coffee, you literally have to chase them down or wave them over to ask for a refill. Meanwhile the servers would congregate near the coffee station. Very odd almost as if they didn't want you to have that second cup. They should set up a self service for drip coffee so you don't have to chase them. Other than this odd quirk the breakfast there is good. ", "date_of_review": "22 February 2018"}

To celebrate a special occasion, we enjoyed a late lunch at the Aviary with a medium sized group. Both the service and food were good, but some of the dishes these could have been improved. For example, the slow braised Longhorn short rib with Dauphinoise potatoes was delicious, but could have included a seasonal green vegetable rather than this being an additional side order. Similarly, the Smoked ham hock terrine starter with pineapple chutney only came with a few shavings of Lincolnshire poacher cheese, some water cress and a thin crisp. This could easily have been complimented with a pickle of some kind and a slice of fresh bread. It was similar with the soup. A side order of bread at \u00a34 seemed a little excessive. With the exception of a steak (too rare for preference when ordered as medium rare, returned but then too well done so not charged to the bill - thank you) all of the dishes were felt to be delicious.

We were looked after by Marianne who was very nice to us - she explained the menu and made some great recommendations. We both had the cod with a side of chips to share. The fish was very fresh and tasty. We were recommended a bottle of Rioja that was also very nice. We tried the cheesecake and the chocolate cake with some great dessert wines. Altogether, an amazing evening. Would definitely go back and recommend :)", "date_of_review": "13 November 2017"}

I was vaguely concerned about ordering the risotto as, I feel, risotto shows, lack of imagination. How wrong I was THIS risotto was full of flavour, the almonds added to the texture of the dish and my previous prejudice about this meal was totally unfounded.

There were eight of us and we'd already ordered in advance (as they'd asked us to), but they'd changed the menu since we ordered just two weeks before, so there was lots of faffing regarding certain meals having to be changed.  When the food arrived, three of the eight dishes were wrong (e.g. salmon instead of bacon with eggs) but it had taken so long to get the food, we decided not to send anything back!  Drink orders took 10-15 minutes to arrive, even when we were ordering wine. This sort of delay would acceptable on eight cocktails as they would have to be made, but not on wine. Apparently, each order just gets added to the bar list, so we were waiting behind someone else's cocktail order.  The staff were very pleasant, but were prickly when we commented about the wait.

This is a high end (but not elite) restaurant which is perfect for business lunches where you want to be at a pleasant venue. The main thing about the location is the view - placed on the top of the Royal London Hotel in Finsbury Square, you get lovely views all around, and particularly across to the South and East toward the skyscrapers off the City. The venue makes the most of it but being enclosed in lots of glass so you can enjoy the view from the comfort of your table. But when the weather permits, they've got a nice outside terrace where you can enjoy a glass or two. Staff were friendly and attentive. The menu was good, but I think I got a bit unlucky with my steak which turned out to be full of thought blood-vessels and I had to leave about a third of it. Pros 1. First rate views of the City 2.

The entrance and interior is of a fancy London outset and looks great. It was busy and if we hadn't been invited, we'd have had to wait a while to get up to the roof bar.  A quick lift ride later, you're on the roof. There's a centre bar serving all your drinking needs. It's not the cheapest place in London but nor is it the most expensive. If you didn't mind paying average to higher end London prices then you wouldn't be coming here in the first place! It's an upmarket atmosphere but casual at the same time. I think a pint of beer is about \u00a36. I bought a round (5 people) of beers and a glass of vino for the lady and it came in at under \u00a340, which I thought was okay. Friendly and helpful staff.

In my opinion, restaurants should be qualified or reviewed in many ways, food, service, hygiene, atmosphere, etc. But what really makes a difference is how do they react when something didn't go as it was supposed or something has been served wrongly. We went for lunch to celebrate my cousins birthday on Sunday, we were 10 people but did a reservation for 7, they had no problem on finding a way to adapt to the situation by kindly adding new seats and tables to it (which I can assure you it is NOT very common in London City).

As he had promised, the view is astounding. The height is perfect and the aspect - facing the river and the crazy new City skyline is quite something. Access is quick and easy (unlike some of these rooftop places). It was a FRIGID night so we just hung out on the terrace for awhile. They have the clear plastic heated igloos for groups and that would be the way to go on these cold nights. We befriended a couple who had snagged a spot under a heater on one of the comfy outdoor couches and extended our time a bit. The interior space is gorgeous and posh with a restaurant on one side and a lively bar on the other. We hung out in the bar for awhile - a classy area with hip but comfortable Mid Century Modern furniture. The bartenders and drink options are excellent and despite our somewhat tatty appearance (compared to a posh holiday party crowd) in down jackets, etc we felt welcomed and well taken care of. Again the view, which you get from extensive window coverage in the bar/restaurant, is the bomb.

Before our arrival I have phoned the venue and asked whether we need a reservation, they said no and when we arrived there - we have been kindly escalated to the table with no problems. The interior design is nice, looks like a mix of styles with a look-back to 60's in the lounge area and a bit more classy in the restaurant area. The bar is just in the middle and you can walk around it which is very convenient. Between 2 of us for our brunch we had the following dishes: * Raw fish sashimi * Linguini with king prawns * Original cider My husband absolutely loved the sashimi dish, even though he is not a massive fan of raw food but as we were in Aviary for the very first time, he wanted to give it a go and see how it is gonna be :-) He loved it!... The dish came in a long plate in a shape of a boat, inside there were brown stones and on the top of stones slices of raw fish, salmon, tuna etc. It looked very nice and unusual, it made us think about the sea right away as the presentation reminded us \"a boat full with fish\"- interesting approach! :) I had avocado linguini with king prawns and I absolutely loved that dish! It came very well-seasoned, not spicy but some zest of chilly which added to a nice flavour, pluscolourful baby tomatoes and well-grilled prawns- very delicius and wel-presentable dish. Cannot fault it for nothing really. We were pleased with our brunch there which topped our meal with a nice original cider. Afterwards, we went to the rooftop terrace and sit outside on cosy sofas, having a refreshing drinks, listening to relaxing music and enjoying a very sunny day over London :) It was a very warm and beautiful day so the whole experience was very nice and enjoyable, we are happy that we have chosen this place for our time out together and we have been one more time to Aviary since, this time with our friends.  On a rainy day, of course, it is less spectacular as you will need to sit indoors...

It was extremely busy but fair enough - although we were told probably 3 or 4 times that we could only have the table for 2 hours. That's fine but when the food service is slow this is a bit rich! We had 2 starters and 2 mains plus a bottle of house champagne and the bill was \u00a3221. Very expensive for what it was and we have paid less at far far better rated restaurants. My partner had the king prawn cocktail to start - it came with a finger bowl but then only one king prawn placed on top and 2 slices of burnt (black) toast. I had the Tuna Sashmi which was served plain and an extremely small serving. We shared a steak for main - which was nice but the side portions (which you had to order separately) were again over cooked. The waiting staff were run off their feet - food took over half an hour to arrive and again between courses. The waitress was slightly inappropriate towards my partner which was uncomfortable. All in all a waste of an experience. We went to the Ivy City Garden the following night and can not recommend that place enough. Save your money and avoid.

While the views didn't disappoint, the service did. And the food was fine, but not noteworthy. What keeps this place popular is absolutely the rooftop view. As one of the only open-air, classy rooftop places in this part of the city - it's guaranteed to be busy. And the setting/ambiance is great.  When it comes to service, there were 3 critical issues, which I would not expect from a restaurant at this price point.  1) One member of our group was a vegan. The server did not seem to have ever heard the term \"vegan\" before and struggled to understand the guests' request to confirm vegan options on the menu. Luckily, the chef was then able to accommodate and confirm vegan options.  2) When I asked for detail on a particular dish (the Salmon Nicoise) and what it contained, I was given an answer that there were no additional ingredients beyond the 4 items listed on the menu, meaning it didn't contain the classic \"Nicoise\" salad add-ons. I did not order this dish, but when another member of our group did, it was immediately clear, that it contained numerous components of a classic Nicoise that were not in the menu description.  3.) Another guest at the table inquired about one of the three sauce options for fish, which is simply titled \"green sauce\". He asked for more detail on what the \"green sauce\" contains, what flavor, etc. The reply from the server was \"I don't know anything about it. It's just a green sauce\".  It's entirely possible that this server had just begun working at the restaurant and wasn't deeply familiar with the menu, but even if that is the case, I content there is still an issue of perhaps not adequate training, and definitely in the server not being accomodating and helpful. I would not expect this from a place that is charging GBP 20-40 for mains. At that price point, I expect a higher level of service.  All of the food we had was good and it was tasty, but not remarkable, and certainly tainted by the service experience.", "date_of_review": "1 August 2017"}

Waiter poured two glasses of wine and left bottle in a bucket on a stand 6 feet away from the table but i think that was to give me exercise as that was the only glass he poured !! The starters were good but nothing special. \"crispy duck\" refers to the breadcrumb coating surrounding it not the duck by the way !! My wife enjoyed her sashimi. 5 mins before our sharing Bone in Rib (\u00a390) arrived i ordered a nice Malbec. 10 minutes later - well into the meal i was told it wasn't in stock so ordered a different Malbec. 10 minutes later it still hadn't arrived so i had to get up and ask the waiter to cancel the bottle and change for 2 glasses of wine which thankfully turned up (as i polished off my last mouthful) The steak by the way was absolutely delicious. We ordered skinny and \"thrice\" cooked chips. I wondered where this \"thrice\" cooked potato delicacy had got to and discovered later it had made it's way to our bill but not the dinner table. Couldn't be bothered to complain at this point. The bill was \u00a3212 for 2 starters, a pint, a G&T a bottle of Albarino a sharing main and 3 sides.

We had drinks on the outside terrace which from the 9th floor gives a wonderful view of the City\u2019s skyline. We then went into dinner. From the moment we sat down, our waiter Drew was attentive and made the best recommendations for food, I can\u2019t remember what it\u2019s called but the hollandaise sauce with marmite was sensational! Starters were delicious, fresh and very large portions. The highlight of the meal was the steaks, possibly one of the best I have eaten in a while, all served with thrice cooked chips and sauces. No one rushed us and we were allowed to sit and admire the views and chat. I couldn\u2019t fault the food, the service, or the ambience. Prices were not cheap, but for a special occasion and from a restaurant of this calibre it is worth every penny.

Two things I immediately noticed as we were seated, that as it was so cold I had to keep my coat on whilst eating and most importantly was how loud the music was. We found talking amongst us was a real problem. Our daughters are mid twenties and they even found the music overpowering! As we go to order the food our waiter tells us that he will grab a pencil then come straight back. Well, we don't see him for another 30 mins or so but manage to attract other servers attention to get this done. Two lemon sole, off the bone are ordered and a chateaubriand to share for my husband and I. Food arrives, the lemon sole is still on the bone and has to be sent back and the chateaubriand is too blue for me, sadly this to goes back too. We are starving by now as the waitress also correctly takes away the fries to be returned with the adjusted food. My husband really enjoys the steak and our girls still need to pick away the bones from the fish. All in all not a great experience.

It's a little out of my usual price range, but I would say it's totally worth the treat. The food was delicious, and portion sizes generous. The raw platter is a show stopper, we also had steaks and a shared a few sides which were all lovely. Service was excellent, Natalie was very attentive and friendly, I couldn't fault her. As we went on a Friday night the bar area was packed, so it was a little loud to start off with but I guess that's what you'd expect somewhere that makes such lovely cocktails and has that view.  I will definitely be visiting in the summer for cocktails on the terrace.", "date_of_review": "4 February 2017"}

After dinner we sat outside in the patio area with a glass of wine ( under a heater! ) Food is reasonably priced and was good. It's not gourmet but the menu provides a Nice selection for all tastes. Big selection of meat dishes but also plenty of options for vegetarians. The restaurant itself is smart and has a nice buzz, I think it would also be a good place if you just wanted drinks.  Would I go back..yes and I think on a spring / summers evening it would be a great place with a bottle of white wine and friends.  ", "date_of_review": "30 December 2016"}

Also disappointing was that there was very limited menu with cocktails and we couldn't order any food at 23.00. That was really shame as at the bar menu there were some snacks but I have been told that they can offer either olives or smoked almonds. When I saw the place online while purchasing the tickets I expected it to be night and party full of fun, tasty drinks and good food.  The view was very nice but we didn't see fireworks just some small lights far away. That was problem of the area probably which is manly full of offices so nobody was there except people in the bars and restaurants. I expected a little bit more from the place and event as well. The place was very nice so I will give them a second try just for coffee or some drinks to see how it is and how they do during the day.", "date_of_review": "2 January 2017"}

I'm usually a West End Diner; City territory is generally out-of-bounds after the working day, especially for a Friday evening. But thanks to DesignMyNight, Aviary had invited me for a meal as part of its continuing launch offer. Great, I thought - until I had the disappointment that there was no availability. So it was with some surprise I received a call from Aviary on Friday afternoon, with a reminder about the booking they had in their system for later that evening. Other plans had beckoned but those were easily dismissed; I'd liked the philosophy behind Aviary's menu and I wasn't about to turn them down. I'm very glad I followed through. It's a fantastic location, at the top of the Royal Montcalm on Finsbury Square. January wind and rain made the terrace inaccessible on this occasion, but I'll look forward to coming back in better weather; the views are well worth it. But the food is truly good, the wine list is very acceptable, and the service was without fault. Starting with a selection of oysters was a shrewd move, for we'd ordered the chateaubriand to share. The oysters were perfectly shucked (always a good test of the restaurant's attention to detail) and were served with well-flavoured sauces (including a fulsome sesame soy). I'd asked the waiter to let chef cook the chateaubriand as he saw fit, which was somewhere between rare and medium rare. Good choice for a spectacular cut of beef. Full of flavour and incomparably tender, the steak knives really weren't needed, for this sliced like butter. My wheat intolerance is always a hassle when dining out, but here the staff made no fuss about it. Pudding was the most obvious example; a special creation of the chocolate mousse ensued, and was again perfect in every way. Was there anything wrong with Aviary? If I had to find fault, it would be the juxtaposition of bar and restaurant; the tables could do with some greater separation, and I'd imagine that with a very busy bar, noise could be an issue. But that's only a minor niggle, and I'll definitely be trying to make my way back. Although if all the reviews are as effusive - I wonder if I will be able to get a table again!", "date_of_review": "9 January 2017"}

It's an interesting environment. High class, expensive, lovely. But also a bustling, loud bar. Makes for an interesting demographic for a romantic dinner, but it's fun to be part of the action. The oysters are TO DIE FOR. The sauce that came with it is one of the most delicious things ever, it somehow manages to add superbly to the taste without taking away from the flavour of the oysters. Can't recommend enough. The pork entree was also very delicious (ordered by my date). The deer main was incredible. Some odd flavour combinations that I wasn't so keen on, but the deer itself was amazing. So tender, so delicious. The steak main was quite chewy, which I would have been a bit disappointed by if I had ordered it, but my date didn't mind it too much so I couldn't let it lower my personal rating. Apart from all that, the staff are great; very attentive and very professional. The location and the view are FANTASTIC. I really enjoy coming here, though the food is quite pricey (we were lucky enough to go during 50% off January), so special occasions only!", "date_of_review": "15 February 2017"}

The staff were all great and especially our waiter (Ilias) was superb. Food from starters to mains to deserts all arrived promptly and tasted really good. From our table there was absolutely no view although a visit to the balcony later was really rewarding despite the cold weather. But the music..... Its not a matter of music taste or preference regarding the volume but even the staff couldn't hear us and we couldn't hear them. If this was just a bar where most people are standing this would be reasonable -maybe- but for a restaurant having a dj and such loud music makes it simply an obstacle rather than a source of entertainment. When it becomes slightly quieter I will certainly come back for dinner.
