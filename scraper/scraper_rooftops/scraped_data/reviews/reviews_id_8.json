We were the only people waiting in the line at that time.  A couple then arrived and decided to ask the front of house staff if she had a table for two also. To our surprise they were told there was a table and taken through?  The front of staff was a short female with black hair in a short / shoulder length haircut.

Upon arrival it was made very clear to us (kind of strayed into the aggressive category) that we had our table for 2 hours and it would be needed back at the set time. Fully understand the need to turn tables, but really think that message could have been communicated in a much better way. Anyway, the food and cocktails were great and decent portion sizes too. Service was alright but nothing spectacular so then rather offended to receive the bill with a 15% tip on it. Obviously understand tips are optional (and a tip was still left) but then the waiting staff seemed hugely offended that the full 15% wasn't paid. I struggle with paying 15% in the USA but for that you do usually get excellent service so feel having their standard service charge at 15% is pretty offensive", "date_of_review": "5 September 2020"}

When no one came we went inside and were greeted by a disinterested maitre d. Whilst waiting to meet our server the ladies next to us were asked to leave to make space for the next seating of customers. Eventually got to order, later heard new couple sitting next to us to hurry up and order as the kitchen was shutting. Whilst eating, a server cleared our side plates, moving the chips and sauce onto the table.. not sure why? Ambience - loud, hot, humid. Cramped together tables. Covid - no distancing between tables at all. Given heat and humidity this would be a high risk transmission environment. Couldn't see the QR sign in code. Food - starter was unpleasant. Ate less than half as it was so greasy. Waiter clearly clocked id not eaten it and then didn't ask what I thought and just cleared the plates. Steak was nice. Chicken and chorizo skewers were good. Chips could have literally come from the freezer at Iceland. Aioli was lovely. Cocktails were okay. Cost- I would happily have paid 30-40 for this meal.however, it cost just shy of 100 pounds. No printed bill given and when presented on an ipad the added service charge was not highlighted (15%). Upon booking a room at the boundary, we were advised that we would receive a glass of champagne each with a main meal. This was not offered to us, and we did not ask as by this point we wanted to leave.  I would never return here.", "date_of_review": "2 October 2020"}

We visited as a large group on Friday evening and did not have a great experience.  To begin with we entered through the lobby only to be unnecessarily held waiting whilst someone phoned up to confirm if there was room for us. A few minutes of waiting we are told there is and that we can go up. What we found when we came out the lift was maybe two or three tables of people, no more. There were more staff than customers so you\u2019d think they\u2019d hurry you up and in rather than waiting downstairs in a small cramped lobby.  We were \u2018served\u2019 (if you can call it that) by a lady who seemed to strongly resent being there. Rather than walking around the table menus were thrown on one side and when the drinks came they were passed to one person to pass around the entire table. With the unfriendly attitude we received we did not stay for more than one drink.  It was only when we decided to leave did our unfriendly waitress smile and actually express some pleasantries.  Should not have paid the service charge. For a place like this where you can sit outside with heaters on a cool February night in central Shoreditch for it to be almost empty on a Friday evening others must also not be happy with something. A shame.  It\u2019s easy to lose regular customers but tricky to get them back once they\u2019ve gone.", "date_of_review": "9 February 2020"}

I mistakenly spilled some of the bottle of red wine we had ordered on the table (I knocked my water glass against it \u2013 an accident). A member of staff came over and offered to get us two glasses of the wine \u2013 we had assumed this would have been on the house. When we asked for the bill (which was approx \u00a3200) we noticed the two glasses of wine were on the bill, we queried this with the waiter who checked with a manager and were abruptly told we were to be charged for the wine.  We paid our bill in full \u2013 but took off the optional service charge because of this and the general bad service. I normally would have complained in person, but as I was on a date I didn\u2019t want to get into it yesterday. I emailed this to The Boundary on Monday - and didn't get a response.

On top of having a birthday meal ruined, they were unapologetic and disgustingly impolite. It got so bad that we didnt even order food. We paid for our drinks and left.

Let me first sing the praises of Emmanuel and Iman who were our champions - from the moment we arrived for lunch in the restaurant and throughout the relaxing afternoon on the rooftop sofas, they guided us through the menu, encouraged us to try the Italicus based Sassy Bergamotto cocktail, which is not only sublime, but quite honestly summer sunshine in a glass - and they were on hand to meet all our needs! We were initially a group of 3 and enjoyed the octopus & chorizo skewers and the plateau de fruits de mer. After lunch we took up a relaxing prime position on a sofa on the roof top, where we we were shaded by one of the olive trees and surrounded by pots of herbs used in the cocktails. Joined by a further 2 family members we then spent the rest of the afternoon sipping cocktails in a wonderfully sunny and vibrant atmosphere.

We were kindly advised by the friendly desk staff that there was a wait and we would be placed on a waiting list, with a text sent once seating was available. We ended up getting the text quite soon on and proceeded to the rooftop. We were graciously welcomed and seated at an available spot. We expressed to one of the hosts that the spot we were at was hot due to the electric heaters and whether we were able to be seated elsewhere; which was not an issue. The problem began when a staff member of the name Bianca got involved and claimed that we were not able to be seated as we had moved 3 times, which was false as we\u2019d only just arrived. She became very unreasonable and rude, not accepting any kind of explanation, where her colleague was happy to seat us elsewhere. Her attitude was disgusting and not the kind of service we are use to from previous visits. There was no excuse for her behaviour which in the end resulted in us leaving with no desire to coming back. We explained the situation once we left to the desk staff, to which we were told she was under it due to a colleague being unwell and her having to juggle a lot. That is no excuse and I will not accept that as being an opportunity to being rude to guests. Very distasteful attitude and most likely will not be coming back particularly if the likes of staff members such as Bianca. You risk losing valuable visitors if attitudes do not change.

When we arrived we were shown to a table along with another party which meant there was lots of confusion about where we were sitting. We were left standing in the restaurant between tables wondering where we should sit. We then just decided to choose a table ourselves as the staff didn\u2019t seemed bothered to show us. This was our first put off. Then whilst we were enjoying our drink the staff were sat at one of the restaurant tables having there hair played with by another staff member. I have never observed such unusual and rude behaviour from staff in a restaurant. At this point we were ready to leave but then we thought let\u2019s give them the benefit of the doubt and see what the food is like. Sadly it was awful! We ordered a Cote de Boeuf to share with a side of grilled vegetables. The piece of meat which apparently was to share was tiny and really a portion for one, most of it was also fat! We had about 5 mouthfuls each before it was gone. For \u00a330 per person this is certainly not enough food nor was it at a standard and quality it should have been. The grilled vegetables were awful too, they were over cooked, cold and in a small pudding bowl. We sent these back as they looked pretty horrible, I wouldn\u2019t serve them myself to guests at home. The staff ordered us something else, chips! The chips were also disgusting. Mac Donald\u2019s chips are better! We complained about the food and the portion sizes and the manager (after he was finished having his hair done) kindly gave us a drink on the house and a cheese plate (which was average and the crackers were from a Jacobs sharing box!). Our waitress was very pleasant but just didn\u2019t seem to enjoy working there- I don\u2019t blame her.  All in all the food is terrible, not cheap, and uninterested staff.

But with a cooler-than-thou greeting, greasy tables, expensive menu, and a loud 'city' crowd it ends up quite unsatisfactory. There's a rude woman with an iPad 'checking you in' before you're allowed up to the terrace, I felt 12 and back in school when she chided me for heading for the lift without talking to her! Awkward start. When you've past customs control and reached the terrace it's nice enough and the food is ok. The underside of the dining tables are greasy and dirty, so if your knees touch there you'll have dirty trousers for the rest of your night. Waited ages to pay our bill. I suppose you pay for the terrace and view, but for easily better service and a wider range of food go elsewhere in Shoreditch.

Great views across all of london on a clear day. Certainly put us in a good mood! We visited on a sunny day at the weekend for early lunchtime cocktails. The bar was busy and had a good vibe... it feels quite exclusive, (and also a little bit difficult to find - my tip is to look up and try to spot the greenery!)  We ordered pitchers of cocktails rather than individual ones to stretch the budget a bit further, and ordered some almonds, olives and breads. The cocktails were lovely, as expected. The snacks were probably a bit overpriced, the breads were a little on the dry side and would have benefited from some olive oil or other dip.  I would definitely go again for drinks.

We arrived around 16:30 Friday afternoon and had to wait for more than half hour outside without even being allowed to see the rooftop as it was full.  We were then offered to wait at the underground bar/restaurant having a drink until a table empties. We later discovered that there was more than enough room on the rooftop with 3-4 empty tables while having waited for an hour and a half already. We asked to be transferred to the top floor and were told in a very rude and unwelcoming way that the bar is still full and the empty tables were booked despite the non-booking policy.  It was only when we asked to speak with the manager that 2 tables magically were available (coincidentally we were 2nd on the waiting list). Arriving on the top floor we found more than 5 empty tables and were given the opportunity to choose amongst all of them as none were booked after all.  Both the food and the drinks were mediocre and overpriced and considering the hassle we obviously refused to pay the 12.5% charged on our bill as discretionary tip. My recommendation to the manager would be to teach their staff and especially the hostess at the door to not lie to a customer's face and treat them in a more professional way. Not recommending it.", "date_of_review": "22 June 2018"}

We were directed in a very lacklustre manner to the lift. Not a great start. Found a decent table and settled down for a pleasant lunchtime treat. Ultimately the only good thing about the experience was the flypast. The menu is ludicrously priced (\u00a319 for a couple of chicken skewers, \u00a339 for a middling white wine). Service was ridiculously slow, their only answer when politely asking when food may arrive was \"its coming, its coming\". It eventually arrived after 75 minutes (bearing also in mind we all only have an hour break from work for lunch) barely warm, no apology. It's not as if they have a complex menu, it's all straightforward stuff.   And then there is the \"discretionary\" 12.5% service charge. Factor that in to your pricing because they will argue against removing it, even when they give appalling service.  To top it all off, 2 out of 3 of our party fell ill within a couple of hours of eating there. A one off visit, never to be repeated.

This did not detract from the ambiance - it's a lovely space with all the greenery making for a really special atmosphere. Being on the roof, of course the views are good. Its not massively high and its setting might not mean a great deal to a lot of people - you cannot really see any particular sights or landmarks if that is what you are after, but it does give you a good feel of the area.  I found the menu slightly limited - seafood platters to share and oysters to start. The 'mains' are basically a choice of skewers. I tried the bavette and halloumi - both of which I found overcooked and dry for my taste, but others might disagree.

The terrace is pleasantly laid out with a nice ambience induced by planted greenery and shrubs. Although the Italian breads and accompanying spreads dips were nice and fresh, the food for us vegetarians was not very exciting, and a bit too bland for our more adventurous taste buds. The table waiters were however very pleasant and attentive.  So just be aware you are probably paying for the atmosphere rather than the dining experience.", "date_of_review": "12 May 2017"}

Food was very low quality ... you can see the photos my tuna was a steak just thrown on a plate with some pieces of vegetables... i asked for medium rear and actually it was medium-well done.... my friends asked for medium and it was rear......we ordered a cocktail's jar and it was served in a horrible bottle with horrible glasses and it was practically full of ice only. The menu looks boring it was only skewers and steak.... we did not order dessert as we prefer move to another place. Service was low standard the waiter asked as to repeat things many times and when he took the payment we said how we wanted to split the bill and he did not trusted our counting and was writing on a piece of paper and counting in front of us .....never happen in any place before! The terrace is not bad as a location the view however is not that great! It is super overpriced for the quality and the service.

This time, I wanted to celebrate a special event and decided the ambiance and view of the rooftop would be a great way to do that. I was not disappointed in that respect - the atmosphere is lovely. However, the service and food really let them down. We ordered a wide selection of food, including the deluxe platter with half lobster, chorizo and octopus, sea trout, lamb cutlets, and a whole lobster.  Firstly, the food was thrown at us SO quickly. It felt very much like they were trying to get rid of us ASAP. Maybe it was a result of this over-rapid service that the food was so awful. Firstly the deluxe platter - the cockels were not washed properly at all and were very sandy and unpleasant to eat. The oysters also had not been opened properly, and there bits of shell in it. Then, the sea trout was served to us completely raw, cold and uncooked in the middle. When we sent it back, there was really no apology, no acknowledgement that we had been served completely raw fish.  Lobster was a bit rubbery, and they didn't prepare it properly i.e. crack the shell slightly before serving.  The only enjoyable dish we had was the octopus and chorizo.  I will never return again. Such a disappointing experience, and I feel upset that I had trusted the Boundary brand to 'host' a special evening for myself and my family.", "date_of_review": "27 March 2017"}

As the weather was going to be good, Boundary rooftop was a preferred choice. The booking was for 9.45pm as that was the earliest available. We are ok about eating late so we went ahead with the booking. We arrived 10mins late at 9.55pm.  We were greeted by the manager and she was very lovely and friendly. We were shown to our table which was at a brilliant position with a huge big sofa. Our waitress came up and gave us our menus, she was extremely friendly, helpful and efficient. Unfortunately within a couple of minutes of receiving our menus another member of staff came up to notify us that the kitchen will be closing in five minutes and that we had to quickly order if we wanted dinner. Feeling quite rushed we ordered a couple of platter to share and then our mains, only to be told everything will arrive at the same time!!! Feeling slightly annoyed, I guess there was nothing else we could have said. We ordered wine too. Dinner and platters arrived at the same time. The seafood platter was good, large and lovely with a variety of mussels, oyster, prawns and crab. The hot food was average at best. Bland and tasteless. Unfortunately before long (11.30pm), we had another staff member come along to say, sorry we are closing soon. You'll have to finish your food and drinks so we can pack up. So were once again, hurried along to pay and asked to leave. We felt that it was such a joke, it was beyond funny. Why take a dinner booking for 9.45 if your kitchen closes at 10-10.15pm? It was birthday dinner that was rushed, and very average. Definitely do not recommend this place for a nice relaxing dinner. Despite the friendly and lovely staff, food as mentioned average and whole process rushed and ruined the night.", "date_of_review": "26 July 2016"}

Luckily the weather was lovely so we could enjoy the sunshine outside.  We took our seats, ordered a drink and waited for a menus to arrive. The brunch menus were somewhat lacking with not much variety.  We went ahead and ordered an almond croissant, fruit bowl and a bacon sandwich.  A few of the items were not available so we could not have our first choice.  The drinks had still not arrived but at least we were enjoying the sunshine.  Drinks finally arrived, a coffee and some grapefruit juice.  Brunch arrived after 30 minutes but not the correct brunch. Eggs and salmon arrived instead of the bacon sandwich. The waiter apologised and reordered the sandwich.  The croissant was huge and rather cake like in texture. Not the sweet flakey pastry that I was after.  The fruit bowl with yogurt which we ordered to share was not as I expected. Instead it was small chunks of fruit in orange juice with a small dish of yoghurt on the side.  The waiter came over to check on our food and was surprised when I mentioned that we were still waiting for the bacon sandwich.  After I'd finished my croissant and fruit the bacon sandwich arrived. We then knew why it took so long. Anticipating a juicy thick bacon sandwich, we were presented with dry over cooked charred bacon on dry bread with no sauce. We requested some sauce and all they had was tomato. My partner couldn't even finish his sandwich as it was bitter and crisp.  We soon asked for the bill so we could make our quick escape. The bill arrived and we asked not to pay service, the waiter then went off for ten minutes to check this was okay with the manager.  We sharply departed and made better use of the Starbucks stand outside that was handing out free coffees.", "date_of_review": "16 August 2016"}

We had to ask for menus, nobody came for 10 minutes to take our first drinks order and we had to play 'let's try and flag down the staff'. After we had finished starters nobody came to take away our plates until again we flagged down staff. The food was average and not worth the premium price. After dinner we realised that we had enough and decided it would be quicker to go home for dessert. The waitress apologised at the end of the evening and said she was 'run off her feet'. I don't blame her it was management that needed to properly staff the restaurant. Trying to cut corners simply backfires, you create a poor customer experience and potential repeat customers like ourselves will not go back.  I asked the waitress about the service charge at the end and if she gets it - it was shared by all staff. I asked her to take it off the bill and instead I gave it to her in cash for herself.

Don't usually write reviews for London restaurants unless I feel especially passionate about my experience... And for the value, this really was up there axone of my worst restaurant experiences in the city! Chosen primarily for it's rooftop, we got lucky with the weather and booked a table for 8pm for a group of six. We were given a table under the canopy which meant our view was largely obstructed and I have to say, it's not really THAT nice of a cityscape in London. Think you could do better at another rooftop bar or restaurant. The service was super slow - we didn't get asked for a drink order for half an hour, although I do have to say the waitress we did have WAS very charming and seemed rushed off her feet.  Looking at the prices, we expected big things. The cocktails (cheapest at 10.50) were honestly nothing above average, like REALLY average (didn't help we'd just come from Sky Garden where the cocktails were the same price and pretty spectacular - highly recommended.) The menu is shalier on the rooftop and we ordered bread and olives. Olives were probably the highlight of the whole meal! Majority of us ordered the rib eye steak and wow, were we disappointed. All ordered medium rare, they arrived all rare - mainly because they were flame grilled so they were burnt on the outside and raw in the middle. We muddled through, coating it in the bernaise sauce and alioli and chips (alioli was good!) Mine steak was 50% though, and when you are paying \u00a327 for a steak (not including a side) you expect it to be a good, tasty cut. Considering the likes of Hawksmoore, Gaucho and Goodmans you can get a basic cut at \u00a320... I was really disappointed at how awful this was.  I NEVER complain (too British) but my friend took the liberty for me and I have to say, they did more than some restaurants might. Admittedly what I wanted was some money knocked off the steak, but they instead offered free desserts for the table. And to their word, they gave us one of every dessert, which made for a nice treat at the end (though did spoil the birthday cake we had but thats sods law.) I cannot stress more that you can do SO much better for your money in London. At a stretch it's nice for a drink on one of the sofas on the main rooftop, but I'd steer clear of the food.", "date_of_review": "25 July 2016"}

Service was patchy - we were seated and then were waiting ages to be given menus - I had to request them in the end. The staff were friendly but appeared to be overstretched. The food itself was very average. I had the rib-eye steak - nothing to write home about - and there was only one sauce option given (bernaise) whereas I'm a fan of peppercorn. However my Dad ordered chicken skewers with tzatziki and spring onions which was very tasty. Once again the staff didn't notice when we had all finished our plates to clear them away, so I had literally had to call their attention again.

The staff were so friendly and polite and never once hassled us to order more drinks or food or made us feel like it was time to leave even though we had been there so long. We hadn't even booked a table and when we arrived there were only indoor ones available where we were sat but as soon as an outdoor one became available we were offered it and all our drinks etc were moved for us, considering we hadn't even booked a table i thought this was really great service! Its also nice that they don't just let people in when there are no tables available so you don't have people standing around your table and it doesn't feel crowded. This is a real gem in the heart of the city you would never know you are in London! Will definitely be returning.", "date_of_review": "10 August 2015"}

Must do better!", "comment": "I'll try to be brief. Came here with friends on 22 July for a belated birthday celebration. First of all we had to wait 50 minutes outside in a queue to get up to the terrace! Don't think I've queued this long for any building in New York (think about it)! And it was fairly early evening around 6.15. So when we did get to the roof-terrace we were shown to some seats which were fine but waited a good 10 minutes for anyone to even offer us a drink or drink list. Probably a reason why the wait to get in is so long! There are enough staff so they need to fix this. Having said that, we really did have a good time and decided while there to ask about a table on the actual same floor. Eventually I went to check for myself and spoke to a really nice lady (the manageress perhaps?) who actually asked a couple if they could move so that we (4) could sit together at a table. Great service from her. We moved and sat at the table for a further 10 minutes waiting for at least an offer of a menu or a wine list but nothing. Service is far too lax, I'm afraid. One of my friends had to ask for menus in the end, to which 1 of the waiters quickly presented them to us with a very sarcastic \"Here are your menus\" as if he was doing us a big favour. The waiter we then ended up with (a short guy with short black hair) was fine-but the kitchen was NOT! I ordered the chicken skewers which were fine but a little dry followed by tuna or swordfish (can't remember which now). The kitchen is open to the floor and we were sat 1 foot away from the main part of it, alongside it. They could see if we had finished or not. I had just eaten the last mouthful of chicken and lo and behold, here was the main course being served. A big mistake. Why on earth couldn't they check if we were all ready-we weren't and needed a breather between courses. The kitchen staff could see us very clearly. The fish was fine by the way, just the kitchen and service slap dash. As we left I said Goodnight to our waiter but he could hardly be bothered to reciprocate. I saw the lady who I think was the manager in the lift going down and I mentioned the service to her. I doubt if there'll be any improvement. A lovely evening because of my friends and the views but let down by the service and lack of attention.", "date_of_review": "3 August 2015"}

What a perfect little sanctuary for a perfect lunch. Roof top is accessed by a lift from ground floor. Seating is rustic and set amongst planters of grasses, ferns and exotic plans (I assume they are as I am not a plant specialist) which gave effect of little secluded areas. Included seating that was more lounger with cushions. I imagine very pretty at night with the lighting and open fires. Menu had great variety as did the wine list. Had the asparagus starter. the Chorizo and squid looked good to. Main was a rib eye steak, flame grilled to perfection and had a very peasant and distinctive taste. To much food for pud so cannot comment on suites. Breads offered were interesting and waiter explained their making, nice touch. Staff were attentive but not intrusive. In summary, a sunny place to have a pleasant lunch or dinner, have a view over the city and only be a short distance away from the office. Somewhere very different to bring your guests for corporate hospitality. Definitely book, don't turn up on spec - was busy. See you there next week ...........", "date_of_review": "13 May 2015"}

Stayed from 1PM until 8PM with friends lolling on the roof it was just lovely. The service was great especially from Leo. Food also brill. I had the monkfish and my friend had the lamb.

The view is interesting and not overlooked, though you're not going to see any London landmarks from here. There is a hipster feel and it is full of Londoners as it always would be considering the location which adds to the great atmosphere. Overall, it felt very relaxed and how a terrace bar should be.

The rooftop area is just amazing, it feels like you're somewhere in Barcelona not in London. The atmosphere is really chilled, with some good music going on in the background. Service was also quite nice and friendly. What disappointed us though was food and drinks. The jug of we ordered Pimms was more about style than substance...nothing really special about it. I ordered a spatchcok poussin which was probably 70% bones, a friend of mine ordered an artichoke which was full of ants, so we were overall not happy about the food.", "date_of_review": "27 June 2011"}

We didn't make a reservation so we ended up in a queue and had to wait for over 30 minutes. But it was worth to wait. We enjoyed the cozy terrace with olive trees and nice seatings. We started with a fruit de mer platter for two, followed by a nice chicken skewers and a goat cheese salad. On the side we ordered a salade nicoise (without the tuna) and french fries.

It was a hot sunny day and we wanted a roof terrace setting so chose here.  The first impression we got from the staff in the reception area was not good. We were spoken down to and told to wait outside. She eventually came out to us and said we can go up. We chose a sofa and table and ordered our first drinks.  The waiter didn't smile once and seemed like he didn't want to be there. We couldn't work out if it was supposed to be a pretentious atmosphere or they were just rude staff. Either way i will never go back here. We spent a tidy sum on drinks, but would have stayed longer and had dinner if we were made to feel more welcome.  I think Mary Portas needs to pay a Visit here.  The only reason I gave this place the rating I did was because of the setting and the view.  The service and the staff would get a very poor vote for sure.", "date_of_review": "17 April 2015"}

Than in the desperate effort to get some source of heat we tried asking the same to a waiter, who told us literally \"we are not turning them because is Summer\", at first I though it was a joke, but he could not be more serious. Finally we decide to order some hot tea to warm ourself up and the the waiter pushed us towards ordering some of the most expensive Hot Toddies ever seen.

Hopes remained high on arrival downstairs where we were greeted by a maitre de, a smiling lady who was expecting us, and a Chef who seemed intent on overseing our entry into the lift. However, on arrival at the rooftop things went progressively downhill. It turns out that the bookable area is all undercover - so we walked past hundreds of people sunning themselves in the open air I had gone through hoops to secure before some bloke reluctantly waved us in the direction of a table which was hemmed in by glass walls (the all-weather area, just don;t use it in summer!). I turned round to appeal for a table \"outside\" but he was long gone. After 5 mins standing around i went in search of the allusive bloke - found a similarly attired one - but was told we couldn't move out to the prime seats. My cohort and I resignedly sat down and rested our arms upon the worlds stickiest table to select drinks. 10 minutes later, menu's and extremeties firmly glued to the table, we again had to wave down a suit to order drinks - he looked astounded at our impudence. Another suit came to take the order (one bottle of wine, one cocktail) and he demanded a credit card upfront - I pointed out that they had my card details as part of the MI5 induction process and then braced myself for a hessian sack over the head to complete my initiation. Ignoring the hiatus before the wine eventually arrived; a further 15 mins passed and the cocktail appeared to have been given to someone much more fortunate than my friend. We waved over the youngest suit and reminded him what it was. He eventually returned with two cocktails and presented blatantly the wrong one to my parched friend. Seriously - it's only one drink - and the clue was in the word \"blueberry\". A green cocktail is probably not the ticket? We didn't leave a tip - and this went against my groups drinking ettitquette almost as much as leaving after just one drink did. All in all, a potentially lovely venue let down miserably by some rude, some incompetent and, a few sweet but slightly dumb staff.", "date_of_review": "16 April 2015"}
