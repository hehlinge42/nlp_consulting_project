The place was nice with a lovely roof bar, cocktails good but sadly there were a few things that let the venue down. My friend had a little guest list but unfortunately some the guests were turned away even tho a few people had left & not packed, her pleads were turned down even when she was in tears, she had no choice but to leave early to join the guests in another venue, the arrogance of the door staff lost the venue a lot of money in drinks the people who left would have spent at the venue. Security rude when another friend left the roof top bar & was bluntly told if you leave you won\u2019t get back in, she didn\u2019t plan on going back up but the comments were unnecessary. I paid cash for a round of drink the second by card, the bar staff do not give you the chip machine to check & found my card on looking at my statement has been deducted more money than the price of the drink, I guess this can be lucrative tip making for an evening as the person may not be aware until too late. The platter that cost my friend \u00a375 consist of two little slates of sushi, so please be aware you will not get that much so maybe don\u2019t bother as this is enough to feed just a few people & a rip off. The venue is nice for a drink if a couple of people go & just be aware of the issues they have, for a big birthday?

The guy they were talking about didn\u2019t fall asleep again he was chatting to his friend and then five minutes later they decided to kick us out anyway. No explanation. Ruined the entire birthday. I could understand if anyone caused trouble or fell asleep again but it was random. Disgusted by the behaviour of the bouncers and looking at other reviews seems they have a lot of issues regarding who they have working for them. Seems as if we spent a lot of money at the bar for a few hours and they just took our money and kicked us out before we could even go downstairs.

She started off by saying no one was allowed up with no explanation, when my partner asked why this was she started asking why he would ask this and didn\u2019t like that he asked at all! (Does she not know how customer service works?) We decided to let her be and continued to wait. I then noticed that she was letting lots of people up the stairs so I asked her (politely) if there was any reason why certain people were allowed up and we weren\u2019t, and this is when she flipped!

Lovely place and ambience. Though as much as I appreciate bouncers doing their job, they should also be able to provide answers. They chucked a person from my group out, when I went to check on him my only question to the second bouncer was \u2018what did he do\u2019? Apparently this was too disrespectful for him to hear and he told me to apologise or I can\u2019t go back inside either. It\u2019s Disgusting abuse of power. Slowly the rest of our Friends came to check up on us and the bouncers chucked them out too. Hmm suspicious racist behaviour here as mentioned by several other reviews about the bouncers at this place.  The funny bit is, people that didn\u2019t even know us, saw what happened and had a word with the bouncers saying they are being unreasonable. No one here had caused any trouble. It\u2019s horrible to think towards the end of the night when all the Money is made they don\u2019t care about service anymore.  Try to learn how to give an answer, it may be your job to Chuck people out but justifying why would be helpful too. Don\u2019t abuse your power to make people you don\u2019t like to apologise for nonsense.  P.s. to the staff of golden bee that tends to reply to these reviews. I\u2019ve seen you don\u2019t tend to take criticism well and tend to send quite nasty replies back. It might be worth taking some criticisms on-board and reviewing things.

I don\u2019t mean to be funny but I didn\u2019t notice any sign and even when he pointed it out you would have to be up close to actually read it. I don\u2019t care what place you are, customer service is always important and you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to talk to customers in the way that he did, making us feel thick for not noticing a sign. At the end of the day, it\u2019s a money making scheme. You should ask whether someone wants a single or double. Not just assume they want a double unless they mention otherwise.

Make sure you book the rooftop in advance if you go even for free guest list as this will ensure entry if not booked it is unlikely you will be able to get in.

Firstly, the music was more suited to a rave, which is fine if your at a rave however I was not so the heavy house music was a little off putting as you couldn't really dance to it, and I go to raves on a regular basis ... When they did actually play a song with lyrics it wasn't even an English song even though it was New Years Eve in London. 2nd - When you ask for a drink and they purposely give you a double without asking you, so naturally your round is more expensive and the drink is extremely strong even though I didn't ask for a double. Thirdly, we couldn't get on the roof top which is kind of why I booked tickets, but on the website I couldn't pre book the roof top area, as I had to be a group of 8 or 12, so that was a little pointless because the night club area is tiny. fourth thing - The clock room was full so I had to wear my fur coat in the night club, the clock room worker was a little rude too to be honest with you. As were the bar staff a girl asked for a normal drink as the other bar makes them really strong and the man had such attitude that she'd asked for single. Good points: its pretty and the drinks weren't that expensive I suppose ... \u00a39 for a double. I think it is more of a day time or early evening drinking place in the summer because I definitely would never go out out there again.", "date_of_review": "6 January 2019"}

It all started (or ended depending on how you look at it) because they do not have any lavoratories upstairs so I had walked down the first set of stairs to find my friend who\u2019s birthday we had met at the golden Bee- Later realising that it was my lucky day having one less set of stairs to be thrown down (by their far from wonderful staff). As we started to ascend the stairs we were told that this was now not allowed so before making my own way out of the venue I asked to get my jacket which I had left at the table we had booked.  Apparently, this was offensive to the lady with the clip board so I asked a friend to help me retrieve the item SHE was allowed to go back up the stairs. Whilst waiting clipboard lady signalled to her colleagues that it was my turn to exit and what an exit it was. If the railings were not there I could have counted every step as they were bumping against my head, instead I managed to escape with two dead arms and a limp.

Heading towards the terrace we were met by an extremely rude and unhelpful lady, of course with \u2018that clip board\u2019 in hand that seems to turn everyone holding it into a complete obnoxious individual.  We met the lady at the bottom Of the stairs, there were a couple in front who were walking up the stairs. We followed and were shouted at to return to the bottom of the stairs. The lady asked if we had a reservation, we explained we did not and she went on to say entry was by reservation only. I asked to make a reservation and she told me \u201cthere are no reservations until September\u201d - helpful.  It seems like there may have been some sort of one in one out policy? Or if your face fits you are ushered up the stairs.

It was not due to capacity because there was a large queue behind us which she allowed to go in as well. This was at mid day but we all found her behaviour towards customers disgusting.

We'd signed up to the guest list approximately 3 weeks in advance which I'd strongly advise doing if you're looking to get in on a Friday or Saturday. Unfortunately, this is where our quarrel lies. On our 3 previous visits, which were always on Fridays and Saturdays, we were allowed to move freely between the terrace bar and other bars. Unfortunately on thks occasion this was not the case. From 8 o clock, we were told that Golden Bees policy was that guests were not allowed up to the terrace, and the terrace was only for guests who had booked a table. This was a huge shame as on all occasions previously we'd never experienced this.  The lady on the stairs did proceed to let a group of 13-15 people who knew her personally upstairs, whilst a large number of people queried why they weren't being allowed up, which seemed to frustrate a large number of people. In the end, our large group went to The Book Club, another bar within the area where we had a lovely evening. I'd recommend large groups to avoid here even if you're on the guest list, as I believe there are other venues that value your business more. I hope some changes are put in to place moving forward to ensure guests are not disappointed moving forward, or alternatively, that it's made very clear that the terrace is only for those who have booked a table, as on this occasion, despite visiting a number of times previously, I wouldn't visit again.", "date_of_review": "19 June 2018"}

If I had one small point of constructive feedback, I would back up the previous review re cigarette smoke, i wonder if the owner would consider splitting the top floor to smoking and non smoking areas as it did feel like we'd gone back in time to before the smoking ban and regularly got clouds of smoke in the face from other revellers who were enjoying their cigarettes.

At 630pm on a Friday in December, the frosty feeling had nothing to do with the weather. It\u2019s from the staff on the door. They are to be congratulated at their skill at keeping people away from the \u201cclub\u201d. Ordering us to leave bags in the cloakroom because there\u2019s no space upstairs. Really, I\u2019ve never seen an emptier bar; probably because the door staff are so good at their job. If you want to relive your youth, this is a great place to visit - they make you feel like you\u2019re an unruly teenager who\u2019s just wandered in after closing time and need to be ordered around. Upstairs, the terrace has an outside, uncovered area - and a covered area. The uncovered area has a fire - it\u2019s clearly unsuitable for outdoor use, as at the first drops of rain it was turned off. So we\u2019re left outside in the rain, with our coat hoods up. Not for long\u2026. \u201choods off\u201d barked the security guy without any explanation.  We\u2019re not allowed to stand outside, on the terrace, in the rain, with hoods on. Apparently we can\u2019t be seen by the CCTV. So, poor placement of their CCTV cameras is our problem - perhaps we should have chosen a bar with better CCTV and more friendly staff. At least the management were reasonable - after I sought management they spoke to the security guy and he left us alone. And the bar staff were friendly and helpful. It\u2019s unfortunate that the staff will probably be battling to keep people in whilst the security team are intent on making paying customers feel cold, unwelcome and an irritation. My mistake for thinking that a bar or club is for my entertainment and enjoyment. Clearly not here. This place is run for the staff not the customers. Avoid it. It\u2019s rubbish.

I went up the tacky pink and brown stairs and found my friend outside and then went into the second floor bar to get a vodka soda. There were two bartenders working, two of the slowest I have ever seen in my entire life, one of whom smelled of body odor and kept exclaiming he was going to lose his mind over the stress... of the empty bar? It could've been because of all the people ordering girlie drinks (I had a vodka soda) but it wasn't even crowded.They gave me my first drink free since I waited so long for something simple. The second time to the bar I tried to use my U.S. card that required a signature, and they said the owner requires a photocopy of the card and the users ID for such a thing. I went with it, mostly out of surprise, despite it violating many global POS privacy and security regulations -- that's my fault.

I called ahead at about 9 to request a reservation and was told one wouldn't be necessary, however I gave her my name and asked for hers (Billie). Billie clearly came through despite saying we didn't need a reservation, as once we got to the door the doorman asked if we had one! Thankfully Billie had put us on the list. We were then surprised with a \u00a37 entrance fee which I had not expected (probably through my lack of research)- also cash only. We had none and were directed to a cash machine very close by, however as it was five past eleven when we went back in, they tried to charge us a \u00a310 fee. Thankfully the lady also on the door sorted this out for us which we were grateful for. Once inside it was clear that The Golden Bee was not what we had been looking for. Expected a good bar with plenty of seating and some medium to low level house music- it was a straight up club full of too drunk try hards. We headed to the ladies immediately where a sloppy drunk lady was getting irate about having to queue. The queue was long, and to top it off a girl who cannot have been older than 18 pushed past to vomit all over the sinks. Charming. The male bathroom attendant definitely does not get paid enough, poor bloke. We then avoided the indoor bar area as it was completely rammed and packed full of men shoving and pushing around. I thought we could try the roof terrace for a quieter, sit down area but when we went to go up there was a fellow only letting people through who had a booking! Obviously I didn't have one (this is the second time we had needed one when I was led to believe we didn't) but a mere mention of Billie's name got us up very quickly. Manners costs nothing, which I think helped also. The roof terrace looks great. Views are nonexistent but it was nice to have the fresh air and there was no risk of getting cold- plenty of heaters. Unfortunately the vibe was similar to downstairs, a lot of sloppy too drunk people pushing to get in at the bar. Thankfully it wasn't as crowded but it was still very busy. The man on the bar wasn't very helpful when discussing drinks and I had to ask for a menu as there wasn't any in sight. I ordered a Golden Bee because I love a gimmick! It was very, very sweet and had a little chocolate bee sitting atop. My friend had a pornstar martini which she said was fine. There was unfortunately nowhere to sit until 1140, and the rooftop closed at 12. If we had known this we wouldn't have come in. We left pretty much straight away and managed to get in at the NightJar down the road, where we paid a \u00a35 cover fee and got to enjoy excellent drinks, our own table, 90 minutes of amazing live jazz,some really comfy surroundings and attentive service until closing at 3.

Initially I was impressed with the decor, but that's about where it ended. My friend was on the rooftop, but we were refused entry as 'more people were expected there', so they had to come down to meet us. The woman guarding the steps was very rude and unhelpful. I enquired at the bar about which cocktails were included in the happy hour prices, and the woman behind the bar reeled off an incomprehensible list, and then turned and served someone else instead. Having worked out that a pornstar martini was included, I had a few of these, and each one tasted different from the last. My friend then managed to order a different cocktail by taking a picture of someone else's - this tasted as if it had no alcohol in it. Another person in our party arrived an hour or so after us, and the door staff were initially not going to let him in as he was wearing jeans and a shirt (apparently not smart enough), until he was rescued by another member of our party. There were others already in the bar wearing jeans, so not sure what that was about?  All in all, this is a pretentious place, that thinks it has class, but does not.

We travelled a fare way to get there and paid a lot and we was really looking forward to it as we reserved a roof top table... It was freezing!! Don't bother reserving until summer!  When we walked in I didn't realise it would be so small and thought there would be other rooms.. No.. The 'dance floor' if you can call it that was smaller than my living room! NO JOKE  We stayed on the roof top for a couple of hours drinking dirty martins which were very nice (but expensive \u00a38.50). Then decided to go get warm inside and have a dance. Bad move! The corner sofa inside is next to the dance floor and a group had hired out the sofas.  We stood drinking our drinks until a girl said sorry you can't dance here we have hired this whole area!!?? .. We asked the bar staff if we could stand there as we wanted to dance (as that's what you do when you go out) they said it was fine to dance there as long as we didn't sit on their sofas. That was fine, we never. So went back and stood there having our drinks as it was there or back outside as there was NOWHERE else to stand..they all started again!  The girls were full of attitude! And then an argument broke out to which WE got thrown out. Very embarrassing! Would never EVER go back again or even would I recommend this place to anyone! The bouncers were pathetic..
