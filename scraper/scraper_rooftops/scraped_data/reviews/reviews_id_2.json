We were greeted by friendly staff. We were led to our table and given an unbelievable view of the Tower of London, Tower Bridge, The Shard and The Gherkin. It was utterly amazing and i felt like a high roller. They take tabs and in the COVID 19 pandemic they do table service. Theres smoking facilities. A balcony with amazing skyline. They only take card at this time. HOWEVER i was a bit disappointed when I found out they didnt do pints. Only bottles. And 1 bottle of budweiser cost \u00a36. Ok its London and a very posh place, but no pints? Not too happy with that. But everything else? Top notch. Defo worth a visit ", "date_of_review": "25 September 2020"}

Thanks to COVID it felt really quite surreal, a bit like being in a David Lynch show.  First we were met on the ground floor by someone checking we had a reservation; they called someone else to let them know we had arrived and called the lift for us. When we got upstairs we were met again and offered hand sanitiser and shown to our table. It felt slightly military-esque. We ordered cocktails which were incredibly strong, to the point of not being very pleasant to drink. The view was nice but the seats we were on were very hard, so we asked to move.  If the bar had been busy I can imagine it having a really good atmosphere but sadly despite it being a Saturday it felt quiet and a bit soulless.", "date_of_review": "27 July 2020"}

We were told that our table was not yet ready, and were led to the bar area at a 'stand up' table to wait until our table was prepared. This was not an issue, the young lady who showed us to the 'waiting' table was very polite. Howver, we were then approached by a waiter, who advised us that we could not stand at this particular table as it was reserved. We explained the situation and advised him we would like to order drinks whilst we waited. Unfortuantely, he became too distracted by what was happening in the outdoor area to actually take our order. He actually held his finger up to my husband to indicate he should be quiet!! Whilst we were being ignored by this member of staff, another member of staff approached us to again say we could not be waiting at this table due to it being reserved. We again explained the circumstances, but was again told that we could not wait at this table. We found both members of staff to be quite rude and not in anyway customer focused. Due to the fact that no alternative arrangement was offered, we had no choice but to leave the premises. We are very disappointed in the service. I have mailed them with details of our experience, with no response. Cleary customer service is not their top priority!!", "date_of_review": "22 August 2019"}

We chose Savage Garden as it has amazing views of Tower Bridge. Fantastic bar as it was lovely weather so we ditched the table indoors as we were lucky enough to get seats out the balcony in front of the bar (best views there). We planned to have a few drinks each here, however..... I was less than impressed when I went to the bar to get our drinks and was charged service charge!...REALLY?!!!!! All the bar tender did was open a fridge door and take three bottles of beer out of it. What a cheek. Table service yes, bar service no! Due to this we decided to just stay for the one and go and spend our money elsewhere (I'm big on principles). Shame as we could've been there for the duration if they hadn't been so greedy.  All in all a great place if you want the views but be prepared to be overcharged for it!", "date_of_review": "26 May 2019"}

It was our first time visiting this bar which was on our way home and near Tower Hill station. The bar is on the 12th floor of the hotel and has two sides to it which are open and the middle bar area which is enclosed. There's a great atmosphere in the open-air bars - one has lots of flowers the other side has umbrellas and music and a perfect view of the Tower of London and the Gherkin as well as other areas of London. We were aware that drinks were going to be more expensive than normal but there was no service to the tables in the outside bar. After waiting a while we then went to the bar which did not appear that busy with people waiting but took an incredibly long time to get our drinks. To add insult they charge service charge at the bar which I think is very cheeky when you've had to go and get your own drinks, they've not been served to you. As we had to wait so long to get served we did not pay the service charge of 12.5%. I would expect that with table service even though I don't think that amount should be charged on drinks but certainly not if you're getting your own. It wouldn't stop us going back as it's a great location but service has to be better and quicker. Unfortunately making cocktails takes them a long time and they're really not great cocktails at \u00a318. Two of our group had them and weren't impressed. ", "date_of_review": "21 April 2019"}

The music is awesome, they have a terrace outside where you can have your drink while admiring the beauty of London from the 12th floor.

She told me she did not have an e-mail from me and gave me a completely different e-mail address from the one listed on the website (?!) and told me to re-send my enquiry. I obliged and yet another day passed with no response. I sent another e-mail to her and again heard nothing. I called and got her answerphone. 6 days after the initial enquiry I got through to another girl on the reception desk. Her attitude was rude, dismissive and patronising. When I asked to speak to a manager and told her I wanted to complain, she miraculously became the \u2018team leader\u2019! She begrudgingly explained the food/drink package to me all with an air of arrogance. I asked her to e-mail these details to me and guess what?....she didn\u2019t!

Not at all, this WAS our table!!! Bare in mind that we had booked a table for 5 and this very small, square, 4-sided 'bar table' that was pushed hard up against a twig, (more on that later) that was hard up against the window! There wouldn't have been enough room for 3 of us eating a meal let alone 5! Then there was the decorations which for this time of year was supposed to be themed 'Narnia'. There was absolutely nothing about a few white painted twigs that remotely resembled Narnia and there was very little else to try to back this theme up, a very poor showing. We checked out the drinks menu and even for central London we all thought that they were really expensive so only two of us bought drinks, (lower the prices and perhaps you'll sell more is my tip!). Then we checked out the food menu, looked at the small choice, looked at the extraordinary prices, looked around, looked at our very small table then all at once we looked at each other and said to each other: 'I'm not a Celebrity, get me out of here'. Well actually I've just made that bit up but 3 of us did say almost together that we didn't want to stay to eat here. So once we had googled the restaurants nearby and finished their drinks we left.
