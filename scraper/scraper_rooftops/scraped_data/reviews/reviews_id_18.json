The waiter called Candi refused for me to order a starter as I arrived few minutes late to a party of six and we only had circa 50 minutes left before we had to leave the table. At precisely 8.30pm he asked us (unpolitely and firmly) to vacate the table while I was still eating dessert. Reluctantly we moved to the bar (wasn't even allowed to finish my last course) and then refused to serve us further. What's even more disturbing is that he was even more rude to my friends before I arrived. The restaurant manager called David finally got involved and apologised for the waiter's despicable behaviour, but sadly it was far too late and the evening was totally ruined. David is the sort of employee that this place should have. And to make us feel even more disappointed and disrespected, we realised that our previous table was still empty even an hour after we were obliged to leave.  I will NEVER EVER go back to this restaurant.

Business and jobs being lost everyday and still people who do have a job do not seem to appreciate it sometimes. After many many many rudeness from candi (telling us every 5 min that we should vacate our table by 20:30, that our friend which came after us could order 3 courses from a la carte menu but not from fixed menu, taking ages to give our drinks, giving us the bill by 20:10 without us asking for it, walking past us and making comments about us to his friends and etc) the \u201ctip of the Iceberg\u201d was when he told us that we had 5 min to vacate our table and when we tried to ask him if he could transfer our drinks and food to another Table he just stormed off and came back after 20 seconds shouting that we had to leave the table immediately... when challenged on his decision, again, he just stormed off and sent one of his colleagues to talk to us, his colleague said that we were welcome to finish our desserts as the table and by then Candi was back shouting and being agressive. By then our night was pretty much ruined. What a shame. Feeling stupid to spend money on overpriced food and drinks to end up being badly treated and having our all night ruined. NEVER AGAIN. Avoid it at all costs.  ps: when we left some 40 min later (We were sitting at the back by then) our initial table was still empty, went for pictures and When we left (this time by 21:40 guess what? table still empty!

It then began to rain so we asked if we could sit inside and we were originally told by one member of staff that there was no space, so we then asked another who could facilitate this and moved us inside. Perhaps the first member of staff did not even bother to check availability inside or simply did not care to accommodate our needs as we were left to sit in the rain again. Once inside, again we were seated at a sofa not a dining table and chairs this was frustrating but we were happy to be inside regardless. We then went to order a bottle of wine and the member of staff asked for a debit card for the tab and we explained we have already given our debit card in when we arrived and was sitting outside. After 15 minutes waiting the debit card was finally found, that was an unsettling experience of a missing bank card. We then went on to order two halloumi burgers and was presented with two fried chicken meals. Considering my friend is a vegetarian I would say this is a little embarrassing on Madison\u2019s behalf as a fast-food outlet would give better service than that. The food error was then rectified but then when we asked for the billed we had been charged for both the chicken and halloumi meals, again this is something else that could have easily been avoided.  Overall this experience was not enjoyable and I feel disappointed with the service received and honestly has put me off returning.", "date_of_review": "28 September 2020"}

Half way through the guy came with the card machine for us to pay which is fine however when my partner went on to say we wanted to spend more money he was told that we should stay within our \u00a3200 budget!!! Sorry but do you not want us to buy more OVER PRICED DRINKS to pay for your wages lol. When we finally finished drinking and asked to pay we were never shown a receipt of the extra that we had spent. we were buying Dissarano / Amaretto shots and was never told how much these were, for all we know the waiter could have just made the price up in his head.

Originally, a friend was meant to organise the table and logistics and I was just meant to come in and make sure we spent the minimum spend- which I think was about \u00a31500. This friend, who knew the managers, told me I didnt need a deposit because he would get this waived and since I was having between 40-65 people and we'd be there all day. Turns out he forgot and when I got there they had no reservation or space or idea about my plans.  This was a make or break situation- and they certainly MADE it. They made makeshift space in the restaurant and tried to organise a cabana which was my original hope. The manager then waived the deposit as long as I covered the balance if the minimum spend wasn't met. That was definitely necessary because my friends and I drink like sailors and had big appetites.  I really appreciated the work they did making the party work properly so quickly- truly accommodating, thoughtful and attentive staff who looked after us and helped with pictures etc. I had names that I had wanted to use in this post but cannot recall them right now.

I find it laughable that a establishment would effectively ask for such amount upfront.. Its not the money its the way they almost demand it. In these trying times they should welcome our business and we would probably have spent that amount but what I dont like is the arrogance of having a minimum spend.

Walked up to the lift and got told to walk back and wait behind the rope by w guy with a feather hat and suit on. Bearing in mind there was noone else waiting it seemed a little strange and authoritative. I made a joke that i wasn't going to 'jump' to which the man gave me a disgusting and rather threatening look which my boyfriend took offence to and suggested we leave and go elsewhere. I tried to calm the situation suggesting to ignore it and its his issue not ours. The lift then arrived at ground level. The man then proceeded to ask my 43 year old boyfriend if he'd \"finished his strop\" and we entered the lift with him apologising for the delay. Passive aggressive and narcissistic behaviour at its finest. Read the reviews, Madison...it's clearly not just us getting this treatment from Mr. Feathery Hat.", "date_of_review": "9 February 2020"}

They do food too which is nice but nothing to write home about.  We really enjoyed it and we have been a couple of times. It'd great for couples but also good just to go with friends.

The mood is always chilled, yet funky, with great music, ambiance, cocktails and views over St Paul's Cathedral.  We returned for our second Winter Terrace Litle Lodge Experience on 10th November and couldn't wait to sample the amazing food again after enjoying it so much previously. The rain hadn't stopped all day so we were really pleased to be offered the chance to be moved in doors to a comfy sofa area, which was quickly reserved for us, providing a perfect chilling pad to enjoy the evening, inlcuding the great DJ sets. We were looked after by Max, the manager, who took over for us when our table hostess, Stefanie, finished for the evening. Nothing was too much to ask. The biggest drawback for us is that we live in the North, so can only get to Madison 2-3 times a year, but this makes it extra special each time we go. If we could do Soul Sunday every week we would.

We found upon arriving a very warm welcome and decided to sit first in the bar area to see the view which is lovely on the 6th Floor overlooking South London. The restaurant is located just on the east side of St.Pauls. The service was very good as was the food and all three of us really enjoyed ourselves. The final bill after two bottles of wine was very acceptable and we did not feel that we were being overcharged. Very importantly for us was that we could talk and hear each other clearly as some other restaurants can be very noisy or have a lot of background noise.

Upon arrival the host was great, when we were sitted we waited a long time before waitress took our drinks order, since both waitresses near us were busy casually chatting and laughing with a manager. After the waitress noticed us waiting and looking at her she came over to take our drink order, and I had to stop her before she run off to tell her we want to place food order as well. Our food was good however not as hot as it should have been. Since we were hungry we didn't want tk call the waitress again, and the absolutely had no checkbacks with any course served. Haven't even been asked if we wanted any more drinks. The restaurant itself is over noisy since you can hear DJ from the terrace playing his music. The place itself looks very nice, but the ambiance is terrible. To summarise, there is a lack of proper management. If a manager were present (not flirting with waiting staff) and overlooked the place, all this ignorant service and atmosphere would have been turned around for the better. The pubs down the road have better customer service then what we've experienced. Definitely not coming back.", "date_of_review": "4 October 2019"}

As we arrived there were two members of staff at the desk; neither of them acknowledged our arrival and carried on with their personal conversation. When I said hello and gave our booking details they had no idea what to do. So, we then had to wait for five minutes before someone else to come to seat us. Not a great start.  When we were finally seated we found ourselves at what might as well have been a bench table, with literally an in between each couple. This didn\u2019t matter in the end though, as the music was so ridiculously loud it was impossible to have a conversation, order or indeed even hear any questions from the waiters. Before our starters even arrived we were desperate to leave.  In the end we asked for the service to be removed as we had not enjoyed our experience at all. No one even attempted to ask why or see what they could do to respond to our concerns, though of course we would have need to leave the venue to have been able to have that conversation. I wonder if it is actually safe for staff to work somewhere with pumping music like that? Perhaps they should have ear protectors for their own health and safety? We have a recording of the volume, it\u2019s such a shame we can\u2019t upload it to warn other potential patrons. What might work in the city as a bar certainly does not work as a restaurant.

The burger meat is horrible - dry and bland (you\u2019d get a better burger in Byron) and the chips seemed re-heated and dry. To charge \u00a316 for such a monstrosity is a joke.  It was jam packed outside on the roof terrace where you can only really see the Cathedral (their USP) if you sit/stand in the corner. If you want to go to the viewing bit to see the view of the city/ take pictures of the cathedral you will not be allowed back into the restaurant/bar, despite it being within about a 10 metre walking distance.

Which is what makes the next thing that happened annoying: There is a temporary AstroTurf area up there, showing the tennis on a big screen. Behind the TV is a little shed with all the audio equipment, we was perched nearby. We was standing there, at this point with a glass of wine each - and a random guy who worked in this room came steaming out, pointed to a speaker on the floor, which had a slice of lemon and an old straw dumped on it - and demanded I remove it.  Obviously not a clue what he was on about - I told him we are drinking a bottle of wine - why would we have lemon slices?! Also told him we literally just stood here from being at the other side of the terrace. Again he told me and my clients to take the lemon slices off the speakers, or be thrown out. So we just left and went to Coq de Argent 3 mins away.  Management: whoever these clowns are you have working there - sort it out. 3 customers with a company card won\u2019t be returning. Not that you care I\u2019m sure, but you will when the place is literally full of 18 year olds taking pictures of St Paul\u2019s, and not even buying a Diet Coke.", "date_of_review": "14 July 2019"}

Our first round of drinks which we put on our tab were missing one. My husband asked for another beer and was ignored so I went to the bar only to be told \u2018can\u2019t help you if you want a beer you pay here now\u2019.  Our table and waitress were good but the food came out separately with one meal taking a good 5 minutes, after I complained, to arrive after everyone else\u2019s. The sides then came out even later.  Dessert was very slow but very good.  When we then asked for the \u2018discretionary\u2019 12.5% service charge to be removed we were treated very rudely. The word discretionary is obviously also discretionary!  I can see why people go there for a drink but paying \u00a3200 for some burgers and chips for 4 people with such poor service is not worth it.

We were sat on the first long table on the left of the restaurant entrance with a reservation at around 9.30pm (to assist with locating our booking). We had an enjoyable meal in great company but I am really quite appalled with the service from two members of staff, one waiting on our table and another at the terrace bar after dinner. The first, a waitress, came to clear our table and my boyfriends dad asked when she was clearing his plate if she would mind cleaning the wet table. This was not an unreasonable request given that nobody had offered to wipe the table after the first course. The waitress threw her hands up in the face of my boyfriends dad and stormed off. She didn\u2019t return and management weren\u2019t particularly bothered either. To avoid ruining both a joyous occasion and an expensive meal we agreed not to allow poor service to ruin the evening. Instead, we decided to head outside for a drink before cabs home. One of our party went to sit down on one of the outdoor seats and was met by cold vomit at her feet. I admit that this ought to be reported but given the number of empty glasses on the table I would dispute that adequate checks were undertaken by staff of customer spaces.  Finally, I went to order a drink at the terrace bar and once my drink had been served the barman was too busy chatting to take payment from me. I outwardly said this to the staff member who was apologetic and took payment whilst continuing to chat. Quite frankly, it\u2019s not the sort of service I\u2019d want my establishment to be associated with and I\u2019d really appreciate an update on how management intend to rectify this.", "date_of_review": "16 July 2019"}

It started off great, the service was quick and the crab starter was so delicious. Then it came to the mains and it took them nearly 40 minutes to bring out 3 steaks (funnily enough how long does it take to cook a a RARE steak) all steaks finally came, mine was actually medium well done and my colleagues were completely well done even though they asked for medium. We complained and all the staff members were blaming each other for the mistakes, it was actually pathetic and so unprofrssional. Also what seriously annoyed me was they kept filling up my glass even though I said no and mixed still water with sparkling. Not only that but I have a severe nut allergy and I told them prior and received the allergen menu, however I was actually served a side sauce for the steak that CONTAINED NUTS and I told them and they didn\u2019t even apologise they just changed it over, can you imagine if I had eaten that seriously?! On a more positive note the mash potato, chips and mac and cheese were really good. We then got new steaks and mine came medium rare (wrong again) and laughably COLD INSIDE. No one was hungry by the end of our meal and we just wanted to go. So it came to the bill and we were offered no compensation for the potential serious errors that occurred, after complaining and speaking with the manager she would only take 15% off the bill (we asked for the steaks to be taken off and it was an absolute no) even though the steaks were inedible and not touched, it was actually laughable.

The bar staff argued and argued trying to charge me double. I said leave it and found the bar manager who was equally rude and arrogant.

Don't get me wrong the view (despite it raining)was beautiful, my margarita (although small) was pretty strong & delicious and the food tasted great but it just didn't have the wow factor for me. The waiter brought us the wrong wine, my scallops on my starter were the smallest I've seen and my duck burger consistency was inconsistent through out - chewy in some parts/falling apart in others. I only work down the road so I will probably go again but do think they need to pull up a bit: better service, a few more smiles, maybe better food suppliers and watch out for people that are dressed to casually.

Due to the clement weather, we though an al fresco drink with a view of St Paul's Cathedral would be most desirable. As I am a lowly tech worker, not a high flying city banker, I happen to attend my office in New Balance (TM) trainers rather than a pin strip suit and fine handmade English shoes. Alas upon arrival at this establishment, excited with anticipation, an extremely grumpy gentleman at the door mumbled something to us. Unfortunately it was very unclear and after asking him to repeat himself 3 times we finally established he was saying \"no sportswear\". At this point in time, I considered explaining I'm a decent, well behaved, middle class gentleman who most definitely has not carried out any sporting activities, let alone in my very fine casual New Balance shoes. We considered additional strategies, such as claiming the shoes in question are actually a religious garment, and to deny entry on the basis I was wearing them would be discriminatory. But after careful consideration we decided that the establishment in question has every right to adopt any dress code they wish - and equally have every right to employ the most unpleasantly grumpy door men who couldn't be bothered to show an iota of politeness to those pesky customers; especially such pesky customers who may some day return wearing different shoes, but may well remember the grumpy unpleasant charmless welcome from the doorman, and may in fact decide to never go to Madison again, and indeed may recommend to citizens of London and visitors to this great city to avoid this establishment at all costs.", "date_of_review": "23 May 2019"}

The crowd that the bar attracts consists of girls and boys having had one too many to drinks, shouting, shoving, having arguments with one another and thinking they are on an episode of TOWIE. We were located so close to the bar that the people were actually leaning on our chairs and pushing us further into our table. As we ate our food we then had to endure a couple having an argument with one another which one of them to be chucked out and the other to remain in the bar shouting at the top of their voice the drama that had just unfolded. Upon speaking to the manager he said he was unable to do anything as it was a bar area and they hadn\u2019t actually done anything wrong.

The music was so loud that we couldn\u2019t hold a conversation! The waiter brought our drinks to the table and somehow managed to drop the tray and spill drinks all over one of our party. Obviously that was just a genuine accident and it was rectified. The main problem for us were the other customers. We were seated right by the bar so there were people standing behind us the whole time. In our opinion a lot of them looked under age and obviously couldn\u2019t handle their drink. An argument broke out between a boy and a girl which ended up with the male being escorted off the premises. Even when he had gone though the remainder of the group were still being loud and aggressive. On speaking to the manager he was not prepared to do anything about these people as they are probably regulars who spend a lot of money there and he didn\u2019t want to upset them so we just had to suffer them. All of these factors completely spoilt what should have been a lovely celebratory meal. Madison is a lovely restaurant with amazing views but I think it should make it\u2019s mind up whether it wants to be a trendy noisy bar to attract spoilt immature undesirables or a decent restaurant to attract more mature people who want to enjoy a nice meal and who can actually handle their drink because it certainly doesn\u2019t work trying to be both!

Even though we are mature (60s) the rooftop music was great with remixes of many 80s/90s hits plus the younger clientele were very friendly. to us adding to the vibrant, pleasant atmosphere. The restaurant is inside and casual but smartish. We liked the menu which included Tallegio and Walnut Arancini for a starter (my friend had thin sliced seared veal loin with black grape, endive and parsnip crisps). For the main, I had Corn-fed chicken Breast in Miso with Baked Polenta, Butternut Squash, turnip and Crisp Sage. My friend had Lobster Roll with Celeriac and Avocado Mayonaise. Both mains were tasty and well presented.  For dessert, we had the seasonal French Cheeses which were well present and unusual plus a macaroon selection - the bill with service and a glass of wine came to about \u00a385 which given the location and quality was reasonable.

It\u2019s more Blackpool without the humour. If you like people watching it has a kind of grim fascination. Girls in dresses a size or two too small, guys with muscles out of a tub of protein, bad tattoos, no socks with the wrong trousers, false boobs - it\u2019s all here. Style has passed Madisons by. There are queues to get in the lift to the bar and more bouncers than at a West Ham v Millwall match. The wine list is decent and cocktails current rather than classic. Food is a side show. People come here to look at each other and maybe pick someone up. Music is as you would expect. Tourists come for the view out the window. They have the best idea.

The views over St Paul's and the city would be difficult to better. (The Shard could compete) If you're 20~40 I can imagine this place is high on the list of places to come alongside The Sketch Gallery.  (Tourist will love the viewing platform) The food is OK, but nothing spectacular. Not a scratch on Clos Maggiore, The Shard or Five Fields.... and many more. If it's food you want. There's plenty better. In addition, the tables are too close together. Packed in like sardines. I've uprated this review because it's a great place to come for drinks, enjoy the atmosphere, views and cocktails (and maybe have a bite) Without the views and outside roof terrace, it would be a good, but crowded pub with a lot of cocktails.", "date_of_review": "27 March 2019"}

We knew when booking the table that you only get two hours which was fine. We was a party of 8 and we decided we wouldn\u2019t have starters just a main and dessert. We waited for around 40minutes for our mains to arrive which were lovely I must say. The waiter then comes along and put the dessert menus on the table and within seconds takes them away again. We asked why he was doing that he said we had run out of time. I then said to the manager that we wasn\u2019t happy and we didn\u2019t have a starter and the mains took so long to arrive. She was really nice and gave us some seats by the window and gave us free bubbles. We stayed there another two hours and our table was empty the whole time, so I don\u2019t know why we was made to move. I asked someone that worked there to take a picture of my whole family and his reply was \u201cno I\u2019m to busy\u201d it was really rude and abrupt. So we left the place still hungry and without a family photo. My poor husband was so disappointed as he had been planning my birthday as a surprise.

I booked our table via the Evening Standard offer of three courses and a glass of Chandon for \u00a330. One of out party was running late and I was a bit surprised that the rest of us had to wait outside until she arrived, rather than being shown to our table (never experienced this before in any restaurant I have dined at). When our other friend arrived, we were then told we had two hours at our table but this time would start from the time the table had booked i.e. 6:30pm, yet three of us had been waiting outside when we could have been sitting inside at our table enjoying a drink!! We were told, if not busy, we would be able to keep our table for longer. Very strange policy and an explanation would be appreciated.  We had a great table, the staff were very helpful in giving information about the menu, recommendations etc. The food was lovely, although we had to wait over half an hour for our main courses - I had to ask where they were and did think we'd been forgotten. Before our main courses arrived, we were given another glass if fizz by way of apology. Desserts were delicious. I enjoy dining at Madison and dispite the blip at the beginning of our evening and the late arrival of our main courses, I would dine here again and recommend the restaurant.

I wasn\u2019t aware that there was such a lovely rooftop located in this part of London! The restaurant is renowned for its buzzing atmosphere and spectacular views. The menu features ills from the wood fired oven, salads, burgers and a comforting selection of slow cooked classics. Food? The menu at Madison London has an strong array of dishes for each course, as well as a selection cooked on the Josper grill.  To start we ordered a delicious tallegio and walnut arancini with black garlic mayonnaise, soft and well-cooked sauteed scallops and a delightfully colourful beetroot and robiola salad. We were very impressed with our starters and our main course also didn\u2019t disappoint. We ordered a divine lobster roll with avocado mayonnaise and a good sized steak with cauliflower puree. Our sides of truffles fries and bottle of Prosecco made this a sumptious course.  For dessert we were once again impressed with the coconut bombe with pineapple carpaccio and walnut and chocolate pudding, both of which were divine.  Price? The prices for the Josper grill dishes were on the expensive side as they were an average of \u00a325. However the remaining dishes were similar to other high-end London restaurants. Overall? Madison London is a lively restaurant and bar, with super friendly waiters full of great suggestions, and delicious food which is beautifully presented.

One place that I would never recommend to anyone is Madison. After an appalling experience, earlier this year in May 2018, this establishment is black-listed in my books. What was meant to be a joyous birthday celebration with life-long friends, turned out to be one of the most humiliating experiences ever. It\u2019s sad, yet true that racial profiling still exists within London, despite our city being recognised as one of the most multicultural cities in the world. It was horrific to witness our group of friends being subjected to intense scrutiny from the security and management team at Madison, which included our friend being segregated from us at the entrance for extra identification checks (despite the fact that our booking was a late afternoon \u2018brunch\u2019). Several other guests were permitted into the venue during the late afternoon, without being subjected to aggressive security and identification checks. Furthermore, I was surprised to see a member of management escorting our friend to our table, having informed her dining at the venue is being timed, and that it was imperative that she eat and leave on time. What is even more shocking is that the manager was lingering around throughout our entire meal, literally timing us. In all our years of dining at an array of establishments (ranging from Michelin star to local restaurant joints), we have never been treated with such prejudice, so much so that we had to console our friend who was reduced to tears after being treated in such a disgusting manner. We did complain to security and a floor staff member, however no apology was given. We examined how non-black customers were being treated by security and venue staff, and it was clear that the management and other staff members were perturbed by our presence. We live in a day and age where we must not let such prejudice go unspoken of. I shall not recommend this shambolic establishment to any of my family members, friends or clients. Madison may have a certificate of excellence for great food, yet they lack greatly in customer/human relations.", "date_of_review": "21 November 2018"}

It ruined the vibe , came to the place as a nice birthday treat not to be talked to in that manner . I don\u2019t want to put a downer in the place as it\u2019s really lovely and the views are breathtaking but a bit of polishing and upskilling your staff would go a long way . Also perhaps it would be a nice touch not to be rushed while you are trying to enjoy your meal especially knowing we were celebrating something rather than being given an exact slot of dining , don\u2019t get me wrong 2 hours it\u2019s more than ok if everything goes as planned but not when you have to wait 15 minutes between courses to even see the menu or having your table cleared .", "date_of_review": "18 November 2018"}

It's almost impossible to find a table, as nearly every table is reserved. And the drinks have become very expensive. Although Madison charges a typical City price of \u00a36.25 for a conventional 568ml pint, for this price they give you only 2/3 of a pint or 379ml (which Madison calls a \"schooner\" unlike an Australian schooner which is 425ml). So that works out at a whopping \u00a39.38 per pint. Even the Ned further down Cheapside, a slightly more upmarket establishment, charges \u00a36.75 per pint (including its disingenuous service charge at the bar). Per pint of draught Peroni, Madison's price of \u00a39.38 is totally overpriced, even for an upmarket City bar. Does Madison think that customers are stupid enough to be fooled by paying the market price for a pint and then to be given only 2/3 of a pint?", "date_of_review": "21 October 2018"}

All the time huffing and puffing it was an inconvenience for them. I was a little embarrassed to be honest and it cut our time down for the actual sitting and eating, once they made a table for us. Drinks are a little pricey but the food was lovely, it was a shame there were quite a few items on the menu they had ran out of.

I was running a little late so I called my friends to let them know that I was 15-20mins away, they checked with the staff and they confirmed it was ok. I arrived 20mins later and was asked to wait in the queue, in front of me was about 4-5 people my guess was the queue was created to prevent too many people getting into the lift up to the restaurant.  2mins later everyone one in front of me was allowed in but only I was stopped. I heard one of the men by the lift asking the security guy to ask me for ID (I am 30+ btw) I told them I didn\u2019t have any and was only having lunch and nothing else. They shouted \u201cget out of the queue right now and stop wasting our time\u201d! I was stunned, I was visibly shaking and almost in tears. So I called up to the restaurant to let my friends know what was happening, they spoke with a member of staff and they asked me to wait while they tried to sort it, but while I was on the phone, the security said he wasn\u2019t interested in whatever I had in my phone and needed me to leave immediately. 10mins later, the same man that shouted at me approached me and asked if I had a table booked and I said yes, he asked me to follow him. We went towards the lift and he told me that he was going to escort me upstairs and will come back and escort me out in exactly one hour. I asked why I was being escorted and he said he wanted his table back in one hour. We got upstairs and he instructed me to stand at a spot he took me to and asked me not to move, while he spoke to the staff. I felt so embarrassed and humiliated and at this point just wanted to turn around and leave, then I heard my friends calling and waving at me.  When I got to the table, I started trying to tell them about my ordeal when I broke down and cried. I have never been humiliated my entire life like I was in this place. The birthday girl got up and approached the staff at the desk and explained what had happened, she was told that the guy we were complaining about was the manager but there was not apology. My friends asked if I wanted us to leave but I didn\u2019t want to ruin my friends birthday so we decided to carry on with the meal and deal with it afterwards, we went straight to ordering our main and all the while this same manger was making his presence visible to us, pointing at us while taking to his staff. We finished and signaled to the waiter to bring us the dessert menu but instead we were given our bill. I am black in case you are wondering and the rest of my party were mixed. Racial profiling? You tell me. This has been so heavy on my heart and I didn\u2019t know where to begin so tell this story. Sorry about the long review but this was my experience with Madison in a nutshell", "date_of_review": "12 September 2018"}

The last communication I had from this venue was via Tripadvisor, so I\u2019ll have to try and communicate via this platform: Dear John    Further to the reply from a recent Tripadvisor response from yourself , I am emailing in regards to the assault that happened on your premises on 18/08/2018 at approx. 8pm.   Having arrived at Madisons between 7:00 \u2013 7:30pm my 3 female friends and I brought a drink at the bar, and went out to the terrace. Within very little time, a man touched me in an inappropriate sexual way; not once but twice, and had already touched my friend inappropriately also. I made it clear I was upset and shocked by his actions and that it was not OK. He became aggressive, spat his drink on me and then shoved me causing my glass to smash whilst in my hand. This resulted in multiple cuts, one of which needed 4 stitches.   I thought I was in a secure, safe environment; but to my disbelief not one member of security in Madisons picked up on this man\u2019s behaviour prior to the glassing, despite a clear altercation and provided no protection. I would expect a bar of this standard and profile to have proper means of security to ensure safety of their customers especially a petite female against quite a built man; yet I was completely let down and subsequently had to be taken to A&E once police saw the severity of my injury.   I am disgusted that even after the incident took place, Madisons did not remove the male and his friends from the bar.   When my friend had witnessed the complete lack of assistance she requested for the staff or manager to call the police, which was denied twice. She then took it upon herself to call 999. The Police treated this as an emergency, arrived on site and arrested the male almost instantly on accounts for sexual assault and assult. In accordance with your license I believe one of your staff should have called the emergency services rather than my friend.    It took myself (whilst bleeding and crying) to point out the group of males for a second time to get you to action separation from the rest of your customers, something that shouldn\u2019t have even been a second thought.   Your CCTV is so inadequate the sexual assault hasn\u2019t been clearly captured, resulting in the man not being charged. I simply cannot believe you have no cameras on the terrace. How is this safe for people visiting your bar!?  Having reviewed the CCTV, the only reason the incident has been slightly captured is due to an internal camera in the restaurant. Something I find wholly unacceptable especially when you allow thugs who were high on drugs on your premises. This was admitted by the group infront of your reception staff who still allowed them entry only to freely assault me and get away with it!   As a result I have had 4 stitches in my hand which is still bandaged. I am a designer who needs full use of my hands in order to do my job properly. Part of my commute in to London involves driving, which I have also been unable to do, costing me money each day in taxis.   Not only has this caused great disability to my everyday life, but it\u2019s also affected me emotionally. I no longer feel comfortable to go out, and will never go to any D and D run premises again.", "date_of_review": "10 September 2018"}

Arrived back at 7 and was escorted through the bar are by a bouncer to the restraunt. Can\u2019t fault the restraunt which is why it\u2019s 2 stars not one. Our server Tom was great and kept all our drinks topped up. After our dinner we left the restraunt to go to the viewing platform, we walked 3 meters out of the restraunt and were then surrounded by 6 bouncers one of them pointing at me and shouting \u201cis that him\u201d. I was then escorted straight to the elevator with my boyfriend in tow by the 6 bouncers(completely unnecessary as I\u2019m 5\u201d9 and 55kg) . No reason was given and we were bundled into an elevator. When I asked why I was kicked out the bouncer just said I was underage and that the bar was only over 21s. At which point I tried to explain that we had just had dinner and just wanted to see view,he completely ignored me and I was then told to leave. This was so embarrassing and horrible to be kicked out after spending so much money in the restraunt and to be treated like I was mud under their feet. I then found out the following day that my boyfriend was planing to propose on the viewing deck and was left gobsmacked by the forced exit.

I went with friends from work yesterday and everything was awful. This is my first time writing a review for anything and I feel like a jack*** for doing so but it was just that bad and after a 3rd visit I feel it is fair enough as this happens every time! 1. When we left the elevator we had a rude security guard tell us to move even though we had just stepped out of the elevator and another security guard was rude to my friend for carrying her drink from the bar to the drinking area. Why are they always aggressive? 2. The waitress in the seating area North East of the elevators was rude. Our food was late and we ordered at the bar. The bar said they would bring it out. We asked her when it would be arriving and she was just so rude and eventually said \"bar food has to be collected from the bar\" even though we told her they said they would bring out the nibbles. Why are we always left to feel unwelcomed? 3. You pay full whack for a Gin and Tonic and you get charged separately for tonic. Fair enough, if that's your pricing strategy but always makes me feel shafted. But when we ordered several rounds of G&Ts and asked for no more tonic as we had spares we got charged and given extra tonics. We ordered champagne and it was given to us in a warm bottle. I actually feel like we've been robbed but we were trying to have a good time in each other's company so we finished up and left.  My recommendation to anyone is to go to Coq d'argent down the road. It's few minutes walk away, cheaper, nicer seating, less crowded and everyone is friendlier. Andy", "date_of_review": "5 September 2018"}

We were shown to our table and weren't really impressed with very much at all for the rest of the night. The service was OK, not the greatest but not the worst. Our starters (we all had tuna tartare) was the nicest thing about the whole evening. My veal salad was fine but not particularly full of flavor. My friends cesar salad was drowning in dressing and full of lettuce hearts - not sure how much hassle it would have been to cut them out. My other friend had the triple duck burger. She asked for the liver to be left out but we weren't told that that was combined with the confit so those two elements would be left out completely. This only became clear after quizzing a waiter. She also had to ask for her plum sauce which wasn't included in the burger. All in all it was rather disappointing and frankly overpriced.

The setting in theory is great but you don't get much of a view in reality. We'd arrived late afternoon and as it filled up it became more like a trashy nightclub (so it's a 5* if you like that, to be fair). What was really bad, however, was the management. We were sat down at a small table. Two larger tables either side of us. at one point they came round and started putting reserved signs on the tables, apart from ours. The people who were sat at those tables and had just ordered drinks had no warning and were told to leave. They were rightly upset. Then about an hour later the same happened to us. Having just ordered a bottle of wine they informed us that the table was reserved. Apparently we should have known this because of the sign on the table next to us! No waiter had told us we would have to move and they had taken our order for wine. We were then almost thrown out by the security for daring to question this logic. The manager came over and told us clearly the reserved sign included our table because \"it was an area for 10 people\". There was no sign to that effect - in fact it wasa long bench with lots of tables! They evidently decided we didn't fit. As a lawyer in the City I've been to a lot of these post-work places, this is honestly the worst one and it will be the last time.  The wine was nice, so two stars", "date_of_review": "2 August 2018"}

Took 6 or 7 minutes, despite the absence of a queue (it was before the evening rush). Presumably a tawdry effort to make it appear more exclusive than it actually is. The table was grubby, and when I asked for it to be wiped down two waiting staff had to discuss it, and looked upon me as though I had asked them to lick the soles of my shoes.

We were really looking forward to a relaxed and delicious dinner, where we could have a good talk.  Unfortunately, this was not possible, as the music was already on nightclub volume, and it was buzzing with people trying to hear eachother over the very loud electronic music. We did know there would be a live DJ and that there is a bar and nightclub, and we had talked about getting a drink in the bar after dinner. Needless to say, we did not know that the restaurant was in the middle of it all. Even while we were eating, the light was dimmed further. The Madison has such a beautiful view, but it was not posible to see anything from the Restaurant table, as the view was blocked by the already semi-drunk partypeople. Well, that said, the food was delicious and the service was amazing, and I would definately come back - just maybe not at dinner/partytime. Which is also why I gave it a rather good score.

Then one of our sides came but it was wrong we asked for the right order and they didn't even end up bringing it. A few nice touches for our friends birthday thanks to the reception team unfortunately they were let down by everyone else. I complained to the manager who took the service charge off (even though service charge is discretionary and we could have taken it off anyway). Manager didn't seem to appreciate how upset we were. The visit was disappointing.  Once we were finished we were given a glass of champagne which we could even drink because security came and asked us to leave since we finished our food and we weren't 21 then two security proceeded to follow us around forcing us to leave when we were waiting for our friend who went to take a picture, they did it in a very hostile manner we were given attitude by a lot of the staff.

The atmosphere and location However my last visit left a nasty taste which will hugely affect my decision to ever return. A group of us decided to visit for a lunch/afternoon session and take advantage of the great weather and atmosphere. Our visit started absolutely fine, although busy and with part of the rooftop closed for a private function, we had space to move around and enjoy ourselves. The bar staff at the terrace are an absolute asset to the venue, welcoming engaging and fun and they truly made you feel welcome. However as the day progressed more and more people were being crammed into the area. Our group of 13 were unable to reserve a space or table but were allowed to sit at a reserved area until those guests arrived. When they did arrive we were rudely and abruptly ordered to move on. Moving was not an issue as we knew it was coming but the way the staff spoke to us was absolutely disgusting. A group of 5 then came to sit at the large table. I appreciate that more people may have been coming later but the fact we were treated so poorly over it was an insult. We were made to feel that tables are given VIP treatment; a group of 13 there since lunchtime would clearly be spending a fair amount of money and if this is how they prioritise treatment of guests then they sorely missed out. A reservation=money and my impression is that this is thrir only concern.  The waitresses all had foul attitudes, compared to the cheery bar staff from earlier on which made my whole group's mood dip; i heard many other guests making similar comments and complaints. More people were being allowed up and crammed in to the venue which in that weather just proved dangerous and hot. Glasses were being smashed all over the place, you were constantly being barked at to move by staff serving the oh so special tables (\u00a3), and some of the security staff need a review on basic manners. One security man planted himself in the middle of one area and seemed to be doing nothing more than looking the girls up and down. No engagement, no smiles just creepily standing and making girls feel awkward.   I must stress that not all staff were like this; the bar staff, Vlad and Cornelia (?) On security all did their very best but waitresses, front of house and some security staff were just plain rude. I had been considering the venue for a work function but will now reluctantly be looking elsewhere.", "date_of_review": "8 July 2018"}

Knew the terrace was also a public area but had not appreciated you had to go through such strict security to even get into the lift! As you could not reserve an outside table for less than 10 people, we thought we'd go up anyway before our 7pm booking to see the views and see how busy the bar area was. Again, on getting out of the lift we were met with more security and barriers. We got a drink easily enough but decided to come away from the crowded bar area and stand where the \"general public\" were watching the tennis on a big screen. We were stopped by security and told we had to have plastic glasses, then after half an hour we were told to move by security to \"inside\" the rail we were leaning on....so clutching our plastics glasses we duly shuffled round. The 4th of July \"roof top party\" as advertised on the website consisted of a DJ blaring out music (my daughter said it felt like being back in her Uni Bar) and little else. The blaring music continued inside the restaurant when we moved inside for our meal making conversation almost impossible. The decor inside was looking very tired and not in keeping with their \"no trainers\" policy. The food was fairly average.

TUESDAY! We were expecting to to be quiet and the service to be normal but boy were we mistaken. It was heaving and we had booked a table at the restaurant so expected nothing to be different. - When we first arrived the woman on reception told us our table was ready but we should have a drink at the bar first. So we went over to the bar - but there was a huge ridiculous queue - and we returned to her to seat us. - After returning to her she proceeded to leave us standing there whilst serving and seating others and taking bags and even when no one else was left she still kept saying \u2018one minute\u2019 after we\u2019d already told her we\u2019d changed our mind and wanted seating. So disrespectful. - Finally after being seated we didn\u2019t get asked if we wanted drinks. We waited a good 20 mins for someone to even take our food order. - We had about 5 different waiters he ought the meal - all of whom were appealing and not once did we get asked if we wanted another drink regardless of the fact that the people next to us had about 4 different drinks their whole meal and their wine kept getting pored. - we only got one butter with our bread even though we ordered 2. We had to ask 3 different waiters before we finally got a second. - our side plates were not cleared and our tables cleaned before our mains arrived. - our water was empty and was not refilled the whole meal. - The food took about an hour to arrive after ordering it. - after the meal we waited 30 mins for our desert orders to be taken. At this point we were sick of waiting and did not order anything. - we complained to a useless waiter who\u2019d only been working there for 3 days and had no idea how to deal with a complaint and offered us no compensation nor did he bring the manager over. Just horrendous. How this place is still open I have no idea. They clearly have no need to give good service to get people in.

All too typical of London and inflated egos of security/door staff.

AWFUL EXPERIENCE! We were looking for somewhere to eat and drink for my girlfriends 21st Birthday surprise visit to London and decided to try Madisons. We booked a table online and also called up to make sure the booking was secured. All was fine. When arriving at the restaurant we were looked at up and down and instantly turned away for inappropriate footwear (trainers) before any question about our booking, yet there is nothing we can see on the booking confirmation that indicates such a dress code. We were smart but casually dressed and the trainers were not \u2018gym wear\u2019. As if that was not bad enough they had the audacity to charge us \u00a325 each for a cancellation fee (\u00a350 in total!) I am very clear that we have been wrongly charged as the restaurant turned us away, we did not cancel!  We did also note, as we left, that there were other customers entering the restaurant and bar wearing trainers which begs the question of why we were actually turned away? I did over hear someone say the restaurant was very busy which suggests that may have been the reason; perhaps Madisons thought other customers could potentially be more lucrative than a young couple in trainers? It is very clear that we were discriminated against in favour of other customers who were allowed entry wearing trainers, which is unlawful. Furthermore, we continued to watch individuals in larger groups allowed entry to the Madisons dedicated lift that was controlled by bouncers (WEARING TRAINERS TOO!) which I will mention looked scruffy compared to what we had on.  I am sure that after receiving possibly the worst customer service in our lives we will never be returning to Madison\u2019s and will also make an effort in making sure that if friends or family are looking for somewhere to eat or drink, Madisons will be the last place that we mention.", "date_of_review": "2 June 2018"}

Amazing wine choice we went for Barolo flori that is a favourite of my husband, and rose for me which was the bar managers Jorge's recommendation.

Jorge advised us on the new so it all list and we surely have a few new favourites, El peligroso is top of the top , recommend!!!

We were one of the first tables to arrive and got the first round of drinks quickly but after that rarely any of the staff came to ask if we want something else to drink (while there were a couple of more people besides us and our glasses were empty for 10-15min). Had to go to the bar or catch the waiter/waitress to ask a drink and some of the stuff did not understand English when we asked about the menu. Sad to see such a disappointing service when there is so much potential in that place.

It was a beautiful hot summers evening. My husband had made a booking so we had no trouble getting in. I was pleased to see a wide age range of people (not only for youngsters). The rooftop setting is wonderful . Amazing views of our beautiful city. It was very busy but you would expect it to be on a sunny Saturday bank holiday evening. We were served quite quickly at the bar in the restaurant area. Beer/wine is reasonably priced but spirits/mixers are quite expensive albeit not unusual for a venue such as this. Our meal time slot was quite late 9.45pm but it was worth the wait. The food was well presented and extremely delicious. We had the smoked beetroot and the pigs trotter fritter to start followed by the sharing platter for two with chateaubriand and grilled prawns. So tasty and very mouthwatering! Cooked to perfection. The staff and the ambience were lovely. My husband and I both love house music so the DJ was definitely an added bonus. We finished off the evening watching the amazing electrical storm that had started over the city. What an experience! We would not hesitate to return to Madison. A wonderful birthday evening.

However, today (hot, sunny Saturday bank holiday weekend) the cracks showed.  Views etc still marvellous as always. Rude, unprofessional security staff need training in people skills - being publicly yelled at and chased when inadvertently wandered into 'no drinks area was not acceptable. Many seats 'reserved' with no sign of occupants - whilst security staff stated bar operates a first come first serve policy....  Waitresses non existent- went to bar for service. Excellent service at bar and super drinks no complaints there. 3 drinks 36 quid - nowhere to sit... I would suggest having a security staff member who has been trained in customer service to stand at ground floor by lift and advise customers bar full. Much better to turn away custom but ensure high quality service for those in bar than appear shody and unprepared. Tables sticky, toilets not flushing and needed cleaning.  All fur coat no knickers I'm afraid. Won't be back. Many more classy and well run places to chose from.  Shame. ", "date_of_review": "26 May 2018"}

I was smartly dressed and sober. There was a small queue and I noticed a couple of people being turned away, one for wearing trainers. OK, fair enough, trainers can be a no no even in this day and age. A big, smartly dressed doorman, a black guy in a 3 piece grey suit and a strange leather tie approaches me. He is dressed differently than the other security staff and I briefly wondered if he was a member of the public turning people away for a laugh as he appeared from nowhere, or one of Madison's main men. Anyway, he kept saying \"shoes\" to me. \"Have you got a different pair of shoes to wear?\" I said no, I don't carry shoes around with me. So he directs me to a blonde haired woman standing at the front of the queue near the lifts who was trying to look important. I asked her what the problem was. It felt like the pre-dotcom era 20 years ago, when dress codes were more prevalent. The big guy had followed behind me though and said \"Shoes.\" He was obsessed with shoes. It was quite amusing as well as irritating and I remained calm and composed but I had to get in as my friend was waiting and it was a special occasion. The woman was pretty useless. She could see I was wearing a brand new smart shirt, a Ralph Lauren jacket and dark blue cords but didn't back me up at all. \"Shoes. He can't come in because of his shoes,\" said the big guy. My shoes were black, not trainers, and although not perfect get accepted everywhere else. OK, I then went away for 20 minutes. Came back to try one more time and check things out, but both that doorman and blonde were gone, and a very reasonable guy was there, dark haired, around 5' 9in and taking charge. I briefly explained what had happened and he said \"You're going in\" and that was it, I was up in the lift and in the bar. So was the big guy a member of the public or working for a rival bar and turning everyone away from this one? Or genuine, but with a footwear obsession?! I never saw him again during the next 5 hours. Lol Nice bar inside, great views. Lots of security staff watching everyone like hawks but it is possible to relax and enjoy yourself there after the entry rigmarole pretentiousness and a couple of drinks inside you.", "date_of_review": "26 May 2018"}

Full of youth in their 20s and relatively hip if that is your thing. The view of St Pauls is very fine. Unfortunately despite a few security guards there seems to be no control on the number of people allowed on to their roof terrace. This creates an atmosphere akin to a football stadium. Our \"private\" area was installed with a booming bass speaker which was extremely loud. All similar areas had the same arrangement. Conversation is challenging. The food served was all deep fried akin to KFC Chicken et al. What is more troubling is the excessive crowd. I was pushed aggressively by a staff server as she attempted to gain access to the bar. I felt violently by such aggression and told her that her behaviour was totally unacceptable. She dismissed me nonchalantly. I will not be returning. Clearly not a place to entertain mature clients.

My only negative is that no food or drink can be taken or eaten in the terrace area nearest to St Paul\u2019s.

We arrived to find three other people waiting in the queue on the ground floor for the lifts up to Madisons.  We saw the doorman speak to the three people in front of us who promptly turned and walked away. The doorman then spoke with us and stated that there was a private event and therefore unless we had booked a table for lunch we could not enter, we then turned and took a couple of steps away. Another doorman who was standing nearby heard this and turned to us and said \u201chold on, are you having drinks in Madison?\u201d We replied that we were hoping to have a couple of drinks. He informed us that there was no problem with us having a couple of drinks and then called the lift for us. As we entered the lift I heard him speak to the first doorman and state \u201clook at them, they look smart and therefore there is no issue with them entering, you shouldn\u2019t turn them away\u201d. We continued up in the lift and headed to the bar, to find all the outside tables had \u201creserved\u201d signs but only one couple seated in the outside area having a drink. We walked to the welcome desk and they said we could take any table, no mention of the \u201creserved\u201d signs. We sat down at one of the reserved tables and After 5minutes wait we decided to go to the bar to get served as no one came to the table and we didn\u2019t have any drinks menus.  There were four barmen behind the bar, but only one was serving the outside area whilst the others prepped the bar for the day.  As we drank our drinks, we realised that Madisons was implementing an unstated and non-disclosed (on their website) dress code. The three people who were turned away were 2 guys wearing smart shorts, loafers and shirts, the girl was wearing a smart top and skirt. I was dressed in a smart shirt, trousers and shoes, my wife was wearing a smart dress ie no smarter than the three people turned away.  More people began to arrive but it definitely was not a private event, the people who were having lunch were in all sorts of smart and non smart attire. The 8 people who arrived after we did for drinks were all smart casual.  The waiter who was working outside did not attend to us at all. He was too busy looking at his phone and talking to his colleagues. We actually had to wait 10 minutes until another member of staff walked passed and we got their attention and then asked us if we would like anything . It was not a great experience, the staff were not helpful or friendly, the service was poor, the cocktails were not nice and for \u00a312 each not value for money. The discretionary 12.5% service charge at the end just added insult to injury (of course we paid it) we won\u2019t be going back in a rush.  It\u2019s a real shame as the location is great, the views amazing but the service and staff really let the place down. Two other girls who arrived and asked for a coffee were seated but told that the table was \u201creserved\u201d. They had their coffees and left, no sign of the guests who had reserved the table in the 80mins we were there! I guess it\u2019s reserved for people buying alcohol.", "date_of_review": "6 May 2018"}

A general feeling that we should be grateful to be customers. Not at all how it's portrayed in the website. My partner and I booked a table at Madison for 8pm on Sunday of the May bank holiday. We arrived to find a long queue to the lifts controlled by a number of security staff. When we asked if we had to queue with our table reservation we were told we could go straight to the front. The female member of staff in charge of this impatiently told me to be 'quick' when allowing us to walk into the lift. As we stepped out of the lift and onto the roof terrace the music was very loud and the drinking area was very crowded. After queuing for 20 minutes to buy two expensive drinks, we were stopped from taking the glasses beyond the drinking area to where the views of the city could be seen. I can understand health and safety, but it was the rude manner of the security guard that irritated me. After drinking up we were able to take in the amazing views by walking to the quiet part of the roof (past a guy vomiting on the steps). We had only been there about 30 minutes and I wanted to leave. I had no desire to buy another over-priced drink and then stand with my partner in a crowd of people. Instead we tried to access the restaurant, but another rude security guard told us to 'get in the lift and go down'. I told him we were heading to the restaurant to which he replied with his hand in the air 'we're fully booked'. I told him we had a table booked for a few minutes later and he said nothing, just lowered his hand. As we walked past the deafening music and through more crowds at the restaurant doors we soon discovered that it was just as noisy inside. The female member of staff said the table wasn't yet ready and suggested we buy a drink at the bar. We stepped further into the restaurant which looked and sounded awful. It had a cheap black decor and together with the relentless booming music made us feel that we were about to be slung some food in the middle of a night club. Faced with that on the one hand or on the other incurring a financial penalty and going without an evening meal, we decided quite easily to leave.", "date_of_review": "8 May 2018"}

As I arrived just before 1800 there were queues to get in ...When I got out of the lift I was staggered by the dress style of both male and female. This was not a watering hole of those who had simply been busy at their City desks by day. It was more like a bar in Puerto Banus ...There were guys in shorts, deck shoes and T shirts designed for the beach...Sun glasses of course. However it was the girls ( and maybe creatures from exotic Thai bars also) that changed the atmosphere more than anything else ....Not something the lawyers that were previously at New Change would have expected to see on their premises and I dont think generally the ladies were looking to become trainee lawyers!!!. Please be clear I am not objecting at all just expressing surprise and acknowledging the fantastic change that has occurred for the City to now be a party venue...We had a great evening although the music was too loud to talk with each other ( they promised to turn down/off but could not work out how to do so!!!...which spoiled our get together) ...I subsequently found my 24 year old son had been at Madisons for a mates birthday party the night before ...I think that confirms how City venues have changed ...Congratulations to the owners of Madison!!", "date_of_review": "29 April 2018"}

The service was absolutely awful, our drinks took ages to come and when we asked the whereabouts of our drinks the girl who had initially taken out order just rolled her eyes and said they were very busy. I learnt her name was Stephania and she was very rude. What was also so off putting is many times I saw one manager messing round with his staff and vice versa, pulling each other\u2019s cheeks, kissing on the cheek etc. This is not something I want to see when i am out especially in a place that is considered prestige.

We got engaged at St Paul\u2019s cathedral and I thought it was a romantic idea to go have dinner overlooking the building where it all began. Huge mistake. Do not come here for dinner. This is a bar and nightclub with a few tables thrown in a room for good measure. The music on the terrace is so loud that you can\u2019t hear each other speak over the table in the restaurant. The doors to the restaurant were kept open so it was chilly at times and the smoke from the terrace was drifting in, making the place smell like an ashtray. Never before have I had to queue among raging drunk women for the toilets in a restaurant. My theory was confirmed... I was having a romantic dinner in a nightclub (or at least trying to).  On to the food... it\u2019s was edible, just. I had the most bizarre coloured steak I\u2019ve ever seen and my husbands burger was dripping in grease.  If you\u2019re after dinner surrounded by drunk twenty somethings at 7pm, then Madison is your place. If you\u2019re after something with a little class... look elsewhere.  We spoke to the manager and he agreed, the website needs to be changed to reflect the atmosphere... it\u2019s not what people expect and it\u2019s not what it\u2019s advertised to be.", "date_of_review": "13 April 2018"}

Madison has a beautiful scenery and a very nice relaxing atmosphere. The first time we came our order was taken by this girl who initially said to me and my friend she couldn\u2019t take our order as she was new, as I work in customer service I said to her she may as well practice for when she actually starts taking them. She looked quite nervous but despite that she have impeccable service! Our drinks arrived quickly and she always ensured we were okay, bringing us blankets, cleaning our table and giving us advice on the best cocktails they had (which were indeed very good!) She really made the experience at Madison so much better! I came again twice in April and I received very bad service, the staff were rude and ignorant. I gave up on table service and got my drinks from the bar. The bar staff were actually great especially Jorge! Unfortunately I didn\u2019t get to see the girl that served us the first time which was an absolute shame as I was told that she no longer worked there. I never got to know her name but she was short with black hair and looked like she was either arab or Spanish. Out of all the staff she was the only one who spoke good English and looked after me so well.

After our main course was finished, we waited for the waitress to bring the desert menu, however when she came back we were told they needed the table back and therefore we could not order desert. At no time did they tell us there was a maximum time limit on the table. I have never experienced such shocking service and the only conclusion I can come too for being treated that way, was because we were four black ladies.\u00a0 There were groups who had been seated before us and were not asked to give up their table.....so why us!!\u00a0 Once outside on the roof top we saw a camera man taking pictures of the guest, clearly he is employed by Madison to do so.

When went upstairs and waited again, and after showing our ID's again a doorman said in a very rude manner ''not with these trainers''.

Although the food was faultless the service sadly was not. We initially called to apologise that we had been held up and would be a bit late, only to be told we have two hours at the table so it meant we would have less time if we came late. This was the first time this had been mentioned. We arrived and were given a menu each but just one drinks menu between 12. We asked for more and was given only one more! No one came to take any orders, neither food or drink, for ages. Eventually a curt waitress came back with one bottle of water, selected three people and filled their glasses right up, using up the bottle and that was it. She took our orders but once again we waited quite while for the drinks to arrive.  Food orders came next. Disappointingly, I found the menu quite limited and I asked what the people next to us were having as it looked so good, only to be told it is from a different menu completely and in fact one of three total that are actually available. We then had another wait while all twelve of us looked through the new choices. The food itself was exceptional but no attempt was made to match orders with diners as random items were placed in front of you with no one actually asked who it was for. At this standard of restaurant I would expect the waiters to know exactly who had ordered what. A portion of chips were just put into the middle of the table along with a cauliflower cheese and it turned out to be for two people at the end of the table but no attempt had been made to find them.  The bad service continued into the dessert with the arrival of two desserts before the others and no sign of cutlery until we asked a good five minutes after and told, it was coming. Yes, it maybe, but the food is now cold.  And finally, THE most superb pianist sang for us.......but......he was incredibly loud and we struggled to hear each other speaking In all, so, so disappointing", "date_of_review": "27 February 2018"}

Booked a table for early Tuesday dinner. When arrived to the venue for our surprise the place was really busy! As all the tables indoor and even outdoor were taken at that point we went straight to our table. Had a delicious dinner. Potted crab and a ribeye are definitely my favourites. Even in this busy environment everyone was super friendly, professional and attentive.  And once we finished our dinner, went out onto their terrace and had a few refreshing cocktails.  Some would say it is a pricey venue, but it\u2019s worth every penny spent.", "date_of_review": "24 January 2018"}

We had booked two weeks prior with the Evening Standard. Before booking we checked the menu and we were looking forward to the USD Sirloin (we would need to add \u00a36 on top of the \u00a330 offer). When we arrived there we were very surprised with the great views of London. The restaurant was very nice. Before giving our order, we questioned about the steak option as it was not mentioned on the menu as we have seen it. Our lovely waitress remembered seeing it too and was surprised that it was not there. She went and ask her manager who came and explained to us that they never had a steak option on the menu with the Evening Standard offer (If I remember he was Italian). I need to say that he is reaction wasn't very nice and made us kind of looks like we made it up. Our lovely waitress felt so embarrassed about his reaction. She even came back to tell us that even the Chef knew they had a steak option for that menu. I need to say that it didn't spoilt our lovely evening as the food and service we received was excellent. The only downside was the strange story of the steak and also too many managers walking around. The managers walking around made us feel a bit intimidated as every time you were looking at the lovely views, they were asking if we needed anything.", "date_of_review": "29 January 2018"}

We will always head to Madisons when visiting the city and could not recommend it highly enough, as we have done to all our friends who now share the same opinion. With it's fantastic views, service and a vibe that always just gets better and better as the night goes on you just could not want for more. But what really sets Madisons apart are the people that work there, who always make you feel just that little bit special and spoilt. We were there for my wife's birthday this time, and from the moment we walked in and were greeted with 2 glasses of wine and a card from Madisons for Lisa's birthday by the very attentative staff, the evening just got better and better. We were then greeted by the lovely Stanni who we always hope to see, and I who I have to say is a real jewel in the Madisons crown. We do not consider Stanni as a waitress but more of a friend because that's how she makes us feel every time we visit and it is always a pleasure to see her. She looked after us and completely made the evening that more special for the two of us, even reserving a booth for us for when we finished our meal.

The food and cocktails ordered were of a very good standard, but it seemed to take a long while for the waitress to come and get our order for drinks; then a long wait to order the food, and a good while for the food to come. Then a long wait for the bill. My friends and I had a lot of catching up to do so didn\u2019t mind much.  Only one lift was working to go up to the rooftop and this was being monitored- only 8 people were allowed in at one time, which caused quite a queue and a bit of fuss on the ground floor.  That being said I\u2019d go again as the duck burger I had was delicious. I think it requires another chance at a not so busy period. ", "date_of_review": "22 January 2018"}

Again I requested could we have the Table any later... no we couldn\u2019t as restaurant was booked. We arrived at the restaurant to find we were the only diners and we were sat right in the middle, we were hoping for a lively buzzing atmosphere but instead got a dull reception with dull service, dance music too loud for the time of day. Is the place a bar or restaurant? 12-15 youngish peopled piled in, extremely loud and totally took over the bar. We left at 5-30 and only two tables had sat down, that said the sofas were all taken with drinkers.  Food was ok nothing to write home about. We had steak each and a variety of sides and at \u00a331 per steak was hoping for something a little better.  Although all the negatives are small in isolation when combined unfortunately leaves a disappointing below par feeling. Reception - poor Service - poor and slow  Food - ok  Atmosphere - flat at first and then edgy  View - phenomenal  Be careful when you book, if it\u2019s early evening at a weekend be prepared for the Saturday night crew (and music) to take over the place while you dine.

We visited on a quiet Monday night at 5pm in January, we were the only ones in the restaurant, all of the seats for drinks were full. I could not believe they had phoned me that morning threatening a charge of \u00a375 if we did not turn up to which I replied yes, I will be there to which they replied you can only have the table for 2 hours. No problem, I knew we would not be that long but felt a meal is a pleasurable experience and I should not put the phone down feeling threatened especially when there is absolutely no other person dining! I emailed the reservations manager to ask if dining table points were accepted as I had a \u00a310 voucher, she confirmed by return yes they are accepted and said would I like to book a table which I did only to be told when paying the bill these are not accepted, I could not believe it our bill was \u00a3130 and they were quibbling over \u00a310 so I said ok we wont pay service \u00a314 as the service had been poor but we let it go so as not to make a scene they soon accepted the voucher then! As the drinks area is full, we waited ages to get served and then got plastic glasses, they make a fuss about the dress code but the drinks waitress is wearing a puffer jacket as she goes in and out, quite comical really. The tables are very close together, my daughter had to move a chair if she wanted to get out and remember we are the only people eating. There is no music so all we can hear is the barmen throwing glass bottles into a bin making a crashing sound. The waitress never smiled once, just said are you ready to order, we never got to know anyone here and did not feel welcome. The food was ok, lamb is a fatty meat so you will always get bits you cant eat, wish we hadnt bothered, you can see St Pauls from the huge viewing platform which is open to the public, you dont need to come in here. We will not be returning. Also, when in the ladies, you can see the people in the next cubicle from the reflection in the roof so be careful, no privacy.", "date_of_review": "9 January 2018"}

I couldnt book any earlier so I booked a table for 8:30pm. but was told we could get there earlier and chill at the bar. we arrived at around 6:30pm, From arrival we where greeted by polite and bubbly security and host. once out the lift the view is spectacular (make sure you take plenty of pictures). staff where incredibly friendly and energetic, the atmosphere was very chilled even though it was incredibly busy. cocktails where delightful and so where the bar snacks, bar tenders couldnt have been more welcoming and efficient.  luckily our table was available earlier than expected and we where allocated a fantastic waiter who im not sure of his name (Hasal) but he was a pleasant french young man who couldnt have accommodated or served us better. the only detail which managed to slightly ruin this precious good run of a night was the table, we where placed in the corner table near the bar and the sofa which also acts as the barrier of the small dining area and the rest of the restaurant including the bar was used as a resting place for everyone around standing so I found myself constantly being nudged by other customers who kneeled against the sofa or simply passed by to get to the bar (so if you can, do avoid this corner table nearer to bar). Being honest the food isnt anything I havent tasted before nor in anyway outstanding but it was satisfying. All in all my family of 5 and I had a great night at Madison, it is by far one of my favorite nights out in London, yes it is not cheap, but thats not what this restaurant is about, its a combination of one of the best views in London, relaxed yet elite customers and an impressive top notch service from every single staff member. oh! and how can I forget the dj!!! if I wasnt out with the family and a few friends instead I would have no doubt had a couple more margaritas and danced to many of those banging tunes played all night.

The restaurant has a different fell and not so impressive as the outside areas. The menu is Gourmet Classic but the prices do not corespondent with what they offer \u00a3\u00a3-\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3. We had the dick burgers which where good size and quite yammy but definitely highly priced . The staff was a stiff and didn't appeal to our good mood . The bouncers at the entrance are rude but is not difficult to ignore them and have good time.....  There is no parking during the day but after 6pm there is a free parking on the streets around. The closest tube station is St.Paul's and all the buses around are very close by .  Go when the weather is good ( no rain ) enjoy the magical views with your drinks and have fun but first eat somewhere in the shopping centre they are few really good restaurants. ( not expensive) ", "date_of_review": "11 September 2017"}

We were running late for our reservation so I called to see if we could push it back and they did so without hesitation.  Upon arrival, we were seated and I was presented with a birthday card from the restaurant, which was a nice touch. The restaurant is situated at the top of a shopping centre opposite St Paul's Cathedral (amazing views) and has a modern feel. The atmosphere was great, being a Saturday evening they had a DJ playing and the place was buzzing. We had a couple of drinks at our table before ordering a Tomahawk steak to share of which we just had a glass of red each with. The steak was cooked perfectly and instead of a dessert we decided on a cocktail each. They were delivered by the manager who apologised that we had been kept waiting for our drinks during the evening (we hadn't noticed we were waiting that long to be honest) and that all of our drinks would be on the house as an apology. The service was very attentive and they were very busy so we didn't mind waiting anyway but were very grateful of the gesture. After dinner we headed out onto the terrace and asked if one of the security staff would take our photo. He went out of his way to take us into a closed off area of the terrace and took numerous photos of us with the St Pauls in the background. We had one further drink at the outdoor bar before calling it a night, but can honestly say the service and treatment we had on our visit to Madison was second to none.", "date_of_review": "1 September 2017"}

We came around last Tuesday on 8th of July, at around 8.30pm, getting through security was ok, we didn't have as many problems as all the other people claiming in their reviews. Very impressive views indeed, nice music and I must say quick service for when we took our orders at the bar. The bar manager was particularly helpful when he improvised a drink for me when I didn't know what to have, and so was the other girl Gabi I believe was her name, very helpful and cheerful.  I am very attentive to detail, and I like it when I see professionalism especially in high end pretentious venues like this, however at around 9.30 PM, my friend pointed out to me another manager (we could tell as he was wearing a full on suit and had his earpiece on), when terrace was full he sat down next to two women, one of which I presume was the girlfriend as he was approaching her always, the disturbing thing was when he came around to them many times and sat down in front of everyone else at the terrace and was drinking wine next to them. This is unacceptable even in a local bar, but in Madison I would have not expected to see something like this, when management allows themselves to do this kind of things and the rest of people were working and running around, is was very disappointing. My friend asked one of the waitresses his name, she said it was Kaspar? It was a good bar service, as mentioned and will consider coming back to the venue, since there are still people who know how to treat customers. I hope some changes will be made or measures taken, it is completely unacceptable to see a manager on duty drinking in front of customers like it was absolutely normal.", "date_of_review": "15 August 2017"}

I took my partner here for his birthday and it is needless to say that I will not be returning and will highly recommend choosing somewhere else other than this. Do not waste your money. The views are amazing, I cannot fault this, and for a drink the place appears lively and the drinks are lovely so do (if you are considering this place) perhaps start here for drinks and go elsewhere for food. The restaurant however is appalling.  The place is loud (to say the least), if you like to mute out your other half (which sometimes I admit I do) then this is the place! However, if you are looking for even the slightest bit of conversation then avoid like the plague - I couldn't hear myself think. As you walk in there is a reception, the staff are rude and pretentious, I was actually quite shocked. If you are a paying customer (dropping a couple of hundred on some food), then the least I'd expect is a warm (ish) welcome. I do take my partner to these restaurants every year, (clearly not this one) and I have NEVER been to such an awful restaurant with such rude staff, particularly looking at the price. Now, the food itself is ok nothing special, the starters are better than the mains, no doubt about it. The price is not representative of the quality of food. The food, I would suggest is worse than flat iron by a long stretch (\u00a340, or less, for two), so I would urge ANYONE looking at this restaurant to save your money and GO ELSEWHERE. I have provided a list of other high end restaurants to check out below if you wanted to opt for a drink and then go elsewhere for food. You will not get a view at all from this restaurant except when having drinks. The restaurant itself is inside, which I do not have a problem with, but there are people drinking around you and it feels like you are eating in the middle of a club. The waitress could not even hear what I was saying. Anyway the view is blocked out by drinking tables (which doesn't make sense as people both eating and drinking normally pay far more).  Having eaten and gone home I then decided to email my complaints to the restaurant and it is also needless to say they chose to ignore them (which is fine I didn't want to go back), but I would have expected at least an acknowledgment of the email.  It is safe to say I would urge you not to go to the restaurant.  The better \"high end\" restaurants for special occasions that would be far worth your money are as follows: oblix (in the shard), hawksmoor (steak and fish restaurant), mash (steak restaurant), fenchurch (sky gardens - probably the best and priciest of the lot).", "date_of_review": "16 August 2017"}

After we were finished eating, we sat for about 10 minutes before we were asked to leave so they could give the table to someone else. When you are paying about \u00a375 per head, you do no expect this extremely poor and rude customer service.  Regardless we left our table and paid the bill that had the service charge added on at 17.5% which I did not think they had earned, and we had cocktails on their terrace area. As it had been raining their covers were open but lots of seats were wet, so not much care is taken in keeping the area dry, and making sure their guests are comfortable. I wouldn't go back.", "date_of_review": "10 August 2017"}

On arrival I was met by a friendly guy at the door, smartly dressed with a hat on holding a clip board. At first I thought \"Here we go\" with reference to the scores of stuffy venues that have to excuse you while they \"check if your name is on the list\". That was not the case here. A super-friendly hello and into the elevator me and my friends went. Bravo on first impressions Madisons!  After a short but scenic ride taking in eyefuls of St. Pauls Cathedral in the all glass elevator the doors opened to the sounds of melodic Manhattan style bar music and an impressive patio area decked with comfy sofas and well thought out tables. My friends and I were confused about which way to go but were quickly ushered by the helpful staff to a bar area and introduced to our bar staff who would be helping us with drinks for the afternoon. We had barely ordered the first round of drinks when a manager came over to introduce herself and offer us an exclusive seating area. Points again for Madisons! We opted for a table outside on the Patio as it looked like the sun was about to push the clouds away and give us a glorious summer afternoon. The manager briefly went to check if the area was available and came back with a smile helping us to collect our drinks and move us to the area.  From there on, the service (and experience) just got better and better. Here's a list of plus points from my experience: * The waiter looking after did not once recommend the most expensive bottle on the menu as we made our selection from the huge selection of drinks on their menu. He patiently waited for us to select whatever we wanted and answered every question we asked. What a breath of fresh air from the usual London skyline bars where the waiting staff are more like salesmen trying to offload the latest weird concoction usually named something like \"The Triple Jalapeno Mojito Mimosa Shot with a splash of Champagne\"!  * The table areas were comfy, spacious and even came with heaters in case the weather turned (thankfully we didn't need to use them, but incredibly thoughtful being an open patio in London).  * After a few drinks my friends and I felt peckish and decided to order some snacks from the bar menu. The sample food was delightful, very moderately priced and came fresh from the kitchen which was visible from our table. I would recommend the buttermilk chicken bites. Delightful.  * At 4pm another delight, a DJ came along and slowly increased the tempo of the music to match the vibe of the place. By now every table was pretty much full with people having a great time. The crowd was clean and party spirited. A super friendly atmosphere. Even the security seemed to be having a good time.  We ended up staying until late evening and had a wonderful time. I'm not usually one to right reviews but I really feel that Madisons went well out of their way to make us feel more than accommodated and gave us a real experience of how \"going out for a drink\" should be in London.  Thank you Madisons, we will be back!!", "date_of_review": "10 August 2017"}

I think they're only interested if you are on a huge table with a minimum spend tag. I went for a night out with friends a few weeks ago and the experience I had was so bad. I got hit from a man who was on a table and I was very upset by this. Rather than kicking this guy out, they just separated us until my friend returned from the toilet so that I could leave. The guy who had assaulted me was on a table and was splashing the cash so I think this was probably why a blind eye was turned.

Crikey, it has changed!  I did a bit of shopping in One New Change beforehand and got into the lift at the first floor to get to the 6th floor. When I got out of the lift at the 6th floor, I was pointed at with complete confusion, then an apparent realisation \"He got in at the first floor. You are not allowed to do that\". I could see my friends at a table and said that I was with them. I was told I could not speak to them and that, if I wanted to join them, I needed to go back to the ground floor in the lift, then get back in the lift at the bottom, before coming back up to 6th floor.  Strange as it seemed to my watching friends, I went to the Ground Floor and told the man there that I had been sent to the Ground Floor, so that I could go up again. He said \"Stand behind the rope.\" Nothing more. There were no other customers around, but there was a solitary metre long piece of velvet rope in the middle of the atrium, supported by two chrome poles. After I had walked around the chrome poles to stand behind the rope (about 3 metres), a bouncer immediately unclipped the velvet rope to let me through. Once I got to the top, the bouncers waved me through and let me join my friends.  Needless to say, I told the story to my friends as I sat down - and they relayed similar stories with amusement. We left, texted our remaining friends and directed them to an alternative venue, for an enjoyable drink in Paternoster Square.

It was such a lovely sunny day and I thought it would be nice to have a couple drinks on the terrace. We found a table and sat down, no staff came over to welcome us or ask if we needed anything. We must of waited about 10 minutes before anyone even noticed us despite sitting in the very middle of the terrace and trying to flag someone down. We ordered a glass of wine for her and a pint for myself. Two relatively simple drinks that took another 5 minutes to arrive. Please note we went at about 2:30pm and the restaurant was half empty, it took a total of 15 minutes for a very simple order. The glass of wine came with a tiny little bug in it which my girlfriend noticed straight away. When I pointed it out to the waitress she said \"where\" as if I was lying before she then said oh I'll get you another, without an apology. At this point we were both pretty disappointed with the service and didn't really want to stay for another despite our original intentions of planning to stay an hour or so. When the bill came, even that was wrong, with them adding a diet coke to the bill without us ordering it. I am really disappointed as the view and surroundings are indeed lovely, unfortunately the service was poor to say the least.", "date_of_review": "20 July 2017"}

However, when we arrived at the lift the security asked for ID so we gave them our ID and they said you both have to be 21 years of age (my partner was 21 and I am 20) and told us we could not go up at all, even though we booked the restaurant and after a few more minutes of discussing this issue a lady came over and said they had got it wrong, you are allowed in the restaurant but not onto the terrace. Madisons should make it very clear on the website, in bd maybe?! that you have to be 21 before people start booking tables, as this information is not easily found on the website.I do not see why this rule applies as the restaurant/terrace is very upper class so you would not get loud immature 18 year olds in there causing trouble anyway. When we got to the restaurant our table was not ready so they said you can go and get a drink and sit outside on the terrace (another reason i did not understand the 21 age rule).  Finally our table was ready and we had our starter and main. The food was beautiful and the service was very good, we had a lovely woman with very long blonde hair serve us, she was fantastic! We then went on to order more drinks and dessert! While we was waiting for our desserts one gentleman was walking towards our table, as he got to our table he decided that VOMITING all over the floor was a good idea, he didn't just be sick on the floor, it went all over mine and my boyfriends table, in our drinks, on my boyfriends brand new shoes, in my expensive and new hair extensions and over the left side of my FACE!! We both was in SHOCK! The drunken guy got chucked out and the staff didn't seem to know what to do at first until I said I wanted some cleaning products to clean myself up with in the toilet.  While I was cleaning myself up my boyfriend was not happy and made it very clear to the staff that drunken people should not be walking through the restaurant! The staff walked away and came back and explained to us that our bill would complementary and anything else we wanted would be for free e.g, bottles, drinks, more food and they would pay for all the dry cleaning of our clothes. This was very good and understanding of the manager, which we appreciated but we declined the offer as we was more concerned about our personal belongings that stunk of vomit and the incident completely put a dampener on our evening as all we wanted was to go back to the hotel and have a shower!  Apart from the revolting incident that happened that evening everything was lovely! However, I personally think they should look at their rules for the terrace area and restaurant. How can they say to me and my partner you can not come up due to you being 20 years of age when they allow drunken idiots that are 21+ to be up on the terrace and in the restaurant being SICK over other customers. Thank you Madisons for your hospitality and being understanding. We hope to see you soon without the drama.", "date_of_review": "11 July 2017"}

Visited this shambles for a friends birthday, unfortunately I made several errors prior to and during my visit ..... silly me. Firstly I realised on entering that I'd be needing my ear defenders as the music was deafening, but I'd left them at home with my demolition hammer. Suddenly regretted not learning how to sign years ago, this would've been such a useful means of commincation, especially during the ordering process.  I was also completely unprepared for a misaligned bite following one of their bread rolls. Who knew bread could be so indestructable? Unfortunatley only 3 out of the 6 meals went back this should've been 4. Luckily one of us is blessed with titanium teeth and a matching cast iron gut.  Fortunately the replacement meals lived up to expectation ..... unpalatable. After a lengthy deliberation with the waiter and his manager we were offered a table on the terrace providing we spent the discounted minimum spend of \u00a3500 which we were told is generally \u00a31000. Foxtrot Oscar. We did eventually get one bottle of wine between six on the terrace as compensation. Deep joy I was overwhelmed by their generosity. While on the terrace I had time to reflect .......why did we pay? Why had I forgotten the needles for my eyes? Why didn't I prepare and wear trousers so that I could jump off that terrace (modesty issue, nothing to do with the anticipated diarrhoea)  If you want to converse with your guests forget it. If you want decent food forget it. If you're potty trained forget it, you're too old and anyway diapers could be useful.

He didn't know what had happened with the booking and had no real clue how to fix it. He gave us an arbitrary box by the window for after our meal as an apology and stated we could only have the table for 90 minutes. After ordering two very expensive bottles of Prosseco we started to order our food. The waitress stopped us ordering starters as \"the manager said you won't have time, only mains\".  We called the manager over and again he was sheepish, had no real excuse and no apology. This completely ruined our meal and ruined my partners 50th birthday party.  Of course there was no compensation or explanation from the restaurant. We begrudingly settled the bill and left. Thankfully we managed to find another restaurant to accommodate a large number of people on a Saturday night and had no trouble there.  Avoid the Madison at all costs.

We explained we were dining rather than visiting the outdoor bar, but downstairs staff uninterested & turned us away. No mention of this when booking. Have to say I'm quite surprised a central London location doesn't have doorstaff speaking better English so customers can make themselves understood. We had to get a taxi to get ID, & while restaurant staff more than apologetic when we returned \u00a320 later (no complaints with them whatsoever....), door policy on the outside bar leaves a lot to be desired. Food was nice, but the service is very slow & very hard to grab a waiter as it's so busy, & if this wants to be a destination restaurant there shouldn't be so many people at the bar inside as well as outside? Stunning views of night time london over St. Paul's from outside though, & we enjoyed it despite the initial problems. It's pricey, so expect to pay up for the location.  Would I go again?

I had booked a table. A couple of days earlier I was also in the area and wondered about bringing my extended family on spec - so I emailed in the morning. The return email I got was very off-putting with a huge lists of regulations and in no way matching my query. It was SO regimented that I nearly cancelled my booking for this week. However, I decided to give the place a chance. Oh the irony -'only smart casual, no trainers (not even designer)' - says the rulebook for guests etc - yet the waiting staff are in jeans. Probably designer ones if questioned of course, but where is the thinking behind this?! If-you're-not-trendy-you-just-won't-get-it sort of thing?  The views are terrific for sure. The staff are trained to be the usual faultless service without any friendliness. The food was delicious, although the madison fish pie was so curried you wondered what was being hidden - it was very yellow. My starter of mozzarella was delicious by contrast and we had the house wine. We had to ask for the set menu which is available, but not offered at all (it fits what seems to be their policy of making you spend as much money as possible which is not difficult given the eye watering prices) To give you an idea - our lunch with a bottle of wine, tap water - 2 courses (my friend had also had a glass of wine prior to my arrival) came to \u00a391.  The attitude seems to be 'we are a restaurant in the heart of the city with a dropdead view, if you think we are overpriced,, you are just not in the scene and shouldn't be here because we are for serious money' - ie all the city bankers etc  I won't be returning because the experience was not for me - I like something a little more value for money. I bet it looks great at night with St Paul's lit up, overlooking the city - but I'll be honest the Shard was better value and that's saying something! Oh and don't think about going if you are an all female or male group because the policy is to refuse you if you are not a mixed gender group - I have it in writing. Is that against the law?  TIP to restaurant: please have a think about what you are trying to sell and how you do it and please respond to emails in a personal way rather than spouting your dress code and gender specific party details - on that front - you could explain that you don't want hen parties etc that would be perfectly acceptable however whoever is running this place needs to take their head out of the proverbial!", "date_of_review": "17 May 2017"}

The waiter we had was very rude, we asked questions about the food and menu and he was very dismissive and unhelpful. We asked for the chicken and he came back to say we can only have 1 dish and not 3. When the bill came there was 3 olives on the bill (which we asked for originally) but only had 1 on the table so we asked him to do the bill again correctly and he snatched the receipt out of my friends hand!

Was not too impressed with my first visit last autumn. Firstly, who in the right mind greets a customer at the door with with \"You are a little intoxicated, right?\", particularly someone entering completely sober not having drank anything that day and not behaving suspiciously. Seen other people not looking in any way untoward being breathalyzed, but luckily didn't have to go through that... It's simply embarrassing for an establishment in this price range to treat its clients as teenagers. Limited choice of good quality wine at the bar with bottles ultimately served too warm. Most tables on the terrace were empty but marked as reserved. Turns out that minimum spend, in our case \u00a3200, was required to get one. Ok, but could make this clear from the outset, so we wouldn't stand squashed in a small bar area for the first half hour. The bar itself is unremarkable at best comparing to Sketch, Artesian, etc. Recently was in the area and thought of dropping by for a drink only to be refused by a buffoon at the door who insisted I couldn't come in because supposedly I was wearing trainers. In fact what I had on was a pair of smart dark brown leather LV shoes that looked far more appropriate for the venue than the cheap worn down office footwear on those who walked past. I completely agree with the policy rejecting sportswear and like, but at least take time to train your ignorant security staff to recognize the difference. Ended up going to Sushi Samba and had a great time as always. You'd have to pay me to visit here again.", "date_of_review": "15 April 2017"}

Having been before I was aware of the shoe policy, but made the mistake of not mentioning to one of my party. His shoes were smart casual, not scruffy, not trainers. I explained the situation to the bouncer with the hat, and that I was visiting for my 30th birthday. His manner was incredibly rude, condescending and dismissive. Absolutely fine to enforce a policy, but there is a way it can be done with politeness which would encourage return custom. I will also add that last time I visited there was a customer wearing Nike Air Max's at the bar, so clearly a consistency issue with the policy as far as I'm concerned. The bouncers clearly have attitude issues which I see quite a few people have picked up on here which sadly lets the place down. I would suggest some retraining with regards to customer interaction- I certainly won't return or recommend though.

Unfortunately, our table was next to the live music and that killed the evening. Our group was unable to have a conversation at the table without shouting, even to the point where I was screaming my wine order at the waiter because he couldn't hear me.  Most people on my table enjoyed their food. My starter was a little disappointing (a peach and mozzarella salad, where ingredients were fridge cold and it was poorly dressed).  Service was OK - it felt quite difficult at times to attract the attention of staff.

The location is incomparable and the views from the restaurant fantastic but we were very disappointed with the ambiance in the evening.  The restaurant seems confused about what it is and which clientele it aims to serve: we went for dinner and booked on the basis of the excellent menu but there was a DJ in the middle of the restaurant who was playing to the cocktail crowd. The wine menu was extensive but, apparently, unknown to the staff: the bottle of Beaujolais we ordered was unavailable- but this wasn't apparent until our main course was due to be served. Having ordered a \u00a350 bottle of wine, I don't think it unreasonable that it should be allowed time to breathe beforehand but it was only five minutes before service that the staff learned it was out of stock. The replacement we were offered was completely inappropriate for our meal. The food really was splendid. We had oysters and foie gras to start and then shared a lobster and chateaubriand for our main course. It was beautifully cooked and flawlessly presented - sincere compliments to the chef. However, the biggest problem was the music which, whilst being awful, was also terribly, terribly loud and detrimental to both conversation and even enjoyment of the food. If Madison wants to be a cocktail bar then its menu should reflect that; If it wishes to be a restaurant then it should be more considerate to its diners. For the price of the food, one would expect impeccable (rather than slapdash) service and an ambiance which allows conversation. My advice would be to go here either for cocktails before OR after dinner ... despite the demonstrable skill of the chef, the impossibly loud music and confused service make this a place where dinner is not recommended.", "date_of_review": "5 March 2017"}

Apparently my experience wasn't worth a reply, despite being advised to send an email to which they would respond. Its a stunning venue however the management is most definitely not concerned with customer experience.  I was absolutely shocked with the attitude of the restaurant manager on Wednesday 15th February 2017.    My friends decided to arrange my 30th birthday dinner at the Madison and our table was booked for 6.30pm. It started off well but once it went wrong it just got worse!   It started with our server messing up my drink order. I decided to order from a set menu which included a drink.   I wasn\u2019t aware of this and our server decided to take it upon herself and choose my drink for me. Once it arrived at the table I asked what it was, and she said it was the gin based cocktail with tonic water. I don\u2019t drink Gin, so I asked to have a look at the options and choose one of the other once. I then asked for the Vodka based cocktail with tonic water, the drink arrived and it was soda water. Again I really dislike soda, so I asked our server about the Vodka cocktail with tonic water. She became very argumentative saying that she told me it had soda water, even though I clearly pointed out the option with tonic water. She then said she would change it for me and came back with the same drink (probably slightly topped up with tonic water) at this stage I passed level of frustration and went to a female supervisor/manager and said that the drink was just off. She went and got me a glass of the Kettle one cocktail with tonic water on the side, FINALLY!   This manager then mentioned that I had ordered the cocktail with soda water, as she had the menu in her hand, I pointed out the drink I requested from our server 3 TIMES!!!! And nowhere on the description did it say soda water.   Anyway this put a bit of a damper to my birthday celebration, but it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.   Our starters also took quite a while to come out.    By the time we got offered our desert menu\u2019s we were told we only have 15min left on the table, (which is fine, if the restaurant is at capacity or we are taking up a large table) but that wasn\u2019t the case as it was half empty.   So I approached one of the managers as to why this was the case since it seemed like there was quite a lot of space, got told is was due to the fact that they needed to accommodate a table of 6 (mind you there was at least 2 spaces in the restaurant that would have easily accommodated the size of this booking) But hey what do I know, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m running the bookings.   After dropping our desert menu, our server came back 10min later to asking if we had requested our bill.   Seriously! She's been serving us the entire evening and we still have the desert menu\u2019s in front of us, what made her think we asked for the bill. This felt very pushy like she wanted to get rid of us.   We then asked to speak to a Manager.   Dario came over and we ran through our experience throughout the evening and that the service wasn\u2019t what we had hoped for. He was very dismissive of our experience and in fact was trying to create the impression that somehow it was our fault!   In regards to my drink order being wrong, he was completely dismissive, and was like oh well okay. (the very very very least he could have done was said, sorry, I\u2019ll definitely have a look into that)   In regards to the server giving us 15min notice on our table and not even taking our desert order \u2013 Dario\u2019s reply was saying that the area\u2019s are booked and she should have offered us an area in the lounge to enjoy our deserts \u2013 (somehow in the 5min that we were having this conversation we were able to remain at our table) probably due to the fact that the restaurant was still half empty.  Dario changed the server on our table as we'd lost our appetite for desert but decided to stay for some drinks as it was a celebration.    When delivering sparkling water that my friend had ordered which was friend, which was served by Dario, he deemed it appropriate to make a stupid joke \u201cshowing us the label for the sparkling water\u201d referring to our previous server that\u2019s was messing up my drink order at the start of our evening. Followed by him saying \u201ctoo soon, too soon?\u201d We are not friends and this was rude and showcased him not taking our poor experience seriously.   At the very end of the evening my friend wanted to speak to Dario and relay our experience from the perspective of someone that works in the hospitality industry herself. I was shocked to see how dismissive and reflective Dario was in his response to everything we were telling him in regards to our experience. The comment that tipped me over the edge was when Dario replied \u201cOkay so what do you want\u201d!   My stomach turned, this is the most disgusting and disrespectful thing that he could have said in his position. This comment was made to make us feel like we came for handouts at the Madison. I was so angry I asked him to leave our table and I wasn\u2019t interested in continuing the conversation.   My friend made it clear that we weren\u2019t looking for any discounts or handouts. Not once did Dario say I\u2019m sorry to hear that you\u2019re experience hasn\u2019t been great, and I\u2019ll look into the issues you\u2019ve mentioned and we\u2019ll definitely use this to improve our service.   On our way out, I spotted one of the other managers (Kasper) at Madison and asked who the senior manager was to Dario.   I briefly explained the experience at Madison that evening, to which his immediate response was, \"Sorry\" finally someone that acknowledged even for a brief moment our experience that evening. This manager reply was that this doesn\u2019t sound like Dario but he\u2019d look into it.   It was such an unpleasant experience and it really ruined the occasion.   The carelessness of our table was also shown by the fact that my friends had requested a birthday desert plate which never came (probably because we were being rushed off our table) This was also mentioned to Dario by my friend however he completely ignored that, and was like oh okay.", "date_of_review": "7 March 2017"}

It was for out belated honeymoon. I booked well in advance, giving plenty of notice and also gave the heads up it was for our honeymoon. I was called by the staff to confirm the booking and to confirm for the occassion.  I asked for a decent view and romantic table. Upon our arrival, it was very busy which we understood would be the case with being so close to Xmas. We were led to our table, situated right next to the bar and where the food leaves the kitchen etc. Very noisy and over crowded.Probably the worst table in the place. Not in the least bit romatic, no where near any views. Only view I had was of the staff leaving the kitchens. We were left there a good 25 mins before we were even offered a drink or menus. The service was poor. Very slow and miserable. The food we ordered was steak and a burger. This food was average, nothing better than your local pub but the prices were elaborate. Food was a bit cold, I put this down to the service being slow. I had to ask for menus for desserts, we wasnt asked if we would like them. I would never go here again. I think that the majority of your highstreet chain places to eat are on par with Maddison Roof Top.

On occasions I like to wander into places on a whim. Mrs. Electric had to visit this part of London so while she was busy i made some random enquiries about local bars. Madison was mentioned. And i thought ' Well why not...! I am very pleased that i did, too. The location is superb. There is a huge terrace for those who wish to murder their lungs, a very nice bar which also serves food ( for those who wish to fill their stomachs and murder their livers ) . And all topped off with an astonishing view of St. Paul's , should you wish to visit and ask forgiveness for any sins you committed at Madisons.....too much eating, drinking, smoking, flirting, and so on.  In spite of the fact that i generally walk around as if i have just got out of bed and live in a hedge, the greeting at the entrance was very warm and friendly. The lady's name was Alisa ( and probably still is... ) from Latvia and because i am a friendly man, she was very friendly back. She escorted me to a very nice couch with views of St. Paul's and left me to peruse the drinks list. and thus i met another super member of staff, a waitress named Zdenka from the Czech Republic. She was truly wonderful. I felt valued and looked after and because of her and the welcome at the door, decided to stay.  What a lovely Bar. I find it difficult to relax at the best of times, but i relaxed here. And then my wife joined me and she relaxed too. We didn't eat here. We simply drank. But not too much.  A building is only as good as the staff within it. And all of the staff i met here were really good.  Thank you. And well done!!!", "date_of_review": "25 January 2017"}

One thing for sure is they did not cheap out on the dishes they were bringing around we thought. The music was great with a saxophonist we really enjoyed.

Saw they had an evening standard menu that was a 3 course for \u00a325 or 2 for \u00a320 and the normal restaurant menu looked really good and well priced for London. Think the fillet steak at \u00a330 was the most expensive item I could see on there and \u00a330 for a fillet in London is really normal these days. Firstly let me say the venue is beautiful and the roof top terrace has great views of London and there is a lovely area to sit with comfy seats and overhead heating and the Ciroc Vodka bar on the top looked like a cool spot to chill. We had a table for 2 booked on 3rd of jane for 6.45pm we arrived early had a pornstar martini and a cosmo and they were fantastic at \u00a311 a pop again the norm for London but great drinks well served attention to detail like chilled martini glass dress passion fruit so great start. Waitress was lovely and we order the fish pie and the cheese board which comes with a \u00a33 supplement from the evening standard menu so was \u00a323 also had some Savoy cabbage at \u00a35 . The food was great the fish pie was no ordinary birds eye fish pie ! It was exceptional and a good portion I think it's on the menu at \u00a317 well worth it full of flavour and good fish. We spent a few quid under \u00a3115 for two of us but we did have \u00a350 worth of cocktails and water and service was 12.5percent worth it as staff were very good . I think this was all in all a great venue with fab staff and amazing food for what we paid and would love to come back and try the main menu now we ve tried it out. Also they sent me a free happy birthday dessert plate with a sparkler ! Very nice touch!

For main course, we ordered 300g USDA rib-eye, 35 days aged (cost 28 pounds) which was very good as well, fresh meat and cooked with medium rare. We also order half a corn-fed chicken (18pounds), which is nice as well. Chorizo baked beans and grilled field mushrooms, herb crumbs are very good sides, both of them cost 4 pounds each. However, macaroni cheeses and heritage potatoes are my less favourite. I would recommend the bitter chocolate & praline fondant, its milk ice-cream with cherry puree which is a bit spicy. Creative combination and they go well with each other. For drinks, if you like champagne, moet & Chandon is a good choice, if not the pinot noir red wine is good as well!

Yes this was really happening, a venue we had spent the last 2 hours in were not letting him back in for being intoxicated. So what exactly is the policy here? Due to on going work commitments and the very reason we had to leave for 15 minutes my dad had only had one glass of wine all night. It is truly astonishing how the security staff get away with what ever they want here. I have read many of the replies stating things will get investigated. You only have to read the number of issues everybody has with the security to see that there is a real problem rather than an isolated incidents. The door staff are a joke, as already described by somebody else on here. The term \"just doing their job\" is no excuse for their unprofessionalism, lack of judgement and terrible demeanour all round. For an establishment such as this the door staff should be courteous and friendly. They should only have to adapt their posture to an impending threat rather than acting like they are guarding an embassy in the middle of Kabul. There is certainly no need to proceed with the bull dog look as the first impression of Madison's. A small drop in the Ocean it might be, but nether the less at least a group of ladies who subsequently appeared behind us heard what was said and witnessed the attitude of the staff and decided not to visit.

We got there a little before our reservation which gave us time to go to the viewing platform which overlooks London. The views were great - you could see most things from St. Paul's to the Shard. It can get a little bit busy on the platform as anyone can go up there, but this wasn't a problem.  There was a lot of choice on the menu (some of them were a little bit 'out there') but me and my friend decided to order the same - the shoulder of lamb flatbread. It came with some crispy onions and some deep fried goats cheese. It was really nice and very filling, the only thing I would suggest is maybe having a sauce with it, but I would definitely recommend you try this.  The restaurant is very nicely designed and kept well. There are floor to ceiling windows so that you can look out, there is also a bar area for those that just wish to have a drink. The waiters were very attentive and offered free bread and water.  Overall, I think the food and drinks were very reasonably priced, our meal with a soft drink came to \u00a322.00 each.

Bearing in mind that the drinks are not cheap, when I stopped the bar man from pouring the red wine into the same measure that the white wine had just been poured from it was met which a grunt and a mutter from. This was then followed by a payment without any receipt or notification of the total price and a transaction that was made via contactless. I think the general vibe is that people will pay the money regardless and as a result the staff are sub standard and rude. Wouldn't recommend and won't be returning.

The wine also seemed to be a bit bland (led by an Italian colleague, we tried three different reds to try to find a hit!), and just in general this place is one that obviously trades on its wonderful location and central City placement - it was packed on a Monday.

I booked a table on the rooftop after liaising with multiple events team members decided the venue would be perfect for the night I wanted to achieve. I had made it very clear to staff that this was a surprise and that my boyfriend was under the impression that we were going for a meal for two however his friends would arrive at the venue earlier than us to surprise him. This was ruined due to not only incompetent staff but discriminatory practices from the chucking and jiving feather hatted man at the door and an extremely patronising General Manager.  My boyfriend and I arrived first and was met by a man who I assume thought his quick responses were witty although when he rudely approached me stating I looked confused I expressed that I wasn't expecting to wait in a queue his response, \"it's Madison!\". This was quickly followed by his lack of intelligence as he overlooked my name several times on his reservations list telling me I wasn't on there although I could see it with my own two eyes. Security profiled his friends and were a step shy of strip searching them prior to allowing entry. They made excuses as to why they were not allowed in from the shoes they were wearing to the 'mixed party' policy.  While I struggled to make excuses to my boyfriend for more than an hour as to why only the two of us were sitting in a large section and no real meal in sight our waiter completely obliterated my plan by loudly blurting \"you can order more once the remainder of your guests arrive!\" On multiple occasions even after I pulled the him aside to remind him it was a surprise. I was then pulled aside by a blonde man with a beige coat who introduced himself as the Manager, who explained that members of my party were not going to be let in because they were all men. When trying to explain to him that I wasn't aware of this policy and that the table next to mine was filled with men I was rudely interrupted with more reasons as to why they wouldn't be allowed in including derogatory statements that insinuated they were carrying illegal substances making it clear he thought they were just a group of black hoodlums. He was also adamant I knew about the mixed party policy and that their events team member told me verbally. Even arguing that he knew she would've told me although he never participated in our conversations. Our conversation ended with, \"if they are allowed in, you must make sure they're on their best behaviour\". I was deeply offended at this stage as I was certain none of the other tables had been asked to make sure their guests behaved appropriately. I remained calm as I didn't want to ruin the evening further and knew that this rude and as previously stated patronising restaurant manager would use any excuse to deny my friend's entry. After another 30 minutes and having to request to speak to another manager, 5 of my guests were allowed in (I had already paid a deposit for 9 people). My friends told me what they were subjected to at the door being searched to their underwear and told they weren't allowed in as he was wearing Giuseppe trainers (the dress code states 'no sports shoes'). I saw more men wearing sports shoes then I could count as well as a girl in denim dungarees and a T-shirt! The manager later lied stating the restaurant and rooftop have different dress codes hence the reason for people being dressed that way although the website has ONE DRESS CODE! When speaking to the waiter about the difference in minimum spend requirements as this is based upon how many people attend in your group he was extremely unhelpful & I was told there was nothing that could be changed although the manager I spoke to made it very clear during our conversation that if MORE people joined our table our minimum spend would increase. At this point we no longer wanted to finish our evening at the venue however being that I had already paid 50% deposit were basically forced to despite the already terrible service. Our wait times throughout the night were longer than I would expect at times having to get up to find the waiter. Security hovered around our table all evening and even entered on several occasions for reasons I was never made aware of and at no point did I see any other tables experiencing this. An argument between two white males caused a brief disturbance where they were both in one another's face about to fight and conveniently security did not see this possibly because they were too focused on the table filled with black men. I asked again about the discrepancies with the minimum spend as we were ready to go. After another long wait yet another manager came to speak to me. I explained why I 1.) Would not be paying the discretionary service charge and 2.)was leaving an hour early and would not be returning. I received several excuses, lies and a very sad less than heartfelt apology but absolutely nothing was done as they attempted to force me to tip them almost \u00a3100 for sub standard service. I waited for everyone to return to the table and went to the bathroom once I returned the other members of my party had gone downstairs to get more money to settle the bill. Upon exiting the restroom the waiter and same patronising manager made my boyfriend & I feel like criminals while we waited on our friends to come back upstairs. The waiter kept reiterating that he had my card details as though I attempted to run away meanwhile I was explaining to him they were trying to gain re-entry but security wasn't allowing them back in. Instead of communicating with their security they hovered around making the whole process take longer quite frankly purposely attempting to embarrass me and my boyfriend completely ruining his birthday. They still attempted to force us to pay the service charge which we flat out refused and told us they would make sure we never booked with them again. I would like to end this by making sure their owners, management, security, servers and coordinators are aware that I work for a FTSE 250 hospitality firm I will ensure that I along with anyone I know will never attend your venue or any of its associated business ventures.", "date_of_review": "26 September 2016"}

The service was not up to harvest at standards although the view of St. Paul's was lovely it's such a shame the staff were not. Each time a member of our party excused themselves to visit the toilet they were followed in by what I can only describe as Russian thugs! After two hours of lunching and \u00a32500 bill we moved to the terrace. We continued the spending spree and ordered magnums of champagne, once again each time followed in and out of the toilet bare in mind some of the guests were officers and over 70 years of age! They were looking for any excuse to remove us from the premises as we were not the typical clientele. Eventually one of the Russian mob requested to search one of the party returning from the toilet and obviously refused. This chap is an officer and declined of course. On refusal was ask to leave with no explanation just brute force there were now 8 Russian thugs all pumped up on droids looking for a fight so this upset many of the party and caused much friction. We eventually left after finishing the \u00a31000 round of champagne but was ask to leave before and we refused. If you do not want a crowd of chaps don't take the booking or simply if you are looking to have a tear up with a Russian mob this is the place to be.

We arrived at approx 2pm and were told we could only have the area we were seated in until 5:30 which was fine.  It's started well, minus a slightly slow service (drinks often had to be ordered two or three times before they turned up) and we racked up a bar bill of approx \u00a31k (not as hard as it sounds due to there being so many of us.) At closer to 6 we were moved to a different area directly after being handed our most recent round of drinks - also fine. However we were all moved to the outside bar area and within minutes were told we couldn't stand there.  We weren't allowed to walk around outside with our still full glasses so we asked where we could stand. We were told to stand outside the restaurant.  We walked there and were promptly told we had to stand inside. We moved again as directed.  Within minutes a rather rude bouncer came over to us and told us we couldn't stand inside with our bags - we had to check them in. We weren't comfortable doing this as we all had our expensive work laptops in our bags. We were then told we either HAD to check in our bag or leave without the drinks they had just charged us for.  This was all made worse due to the Bouncer being particularly rude, refusing to listen to us or let us finish our sentences, talking over us and generally being a stereotypical arrogant doorman. He even cut his own staff down when they tried to assist us! To be honest, apart from the view of St Pauls Cathedral, the bar wasn't particularly special to start with. The service, whilst very polite from the staff, was slow with drinks often being forgotten. And the entry system was clearly flawed - we entered at 2pm with no issues, but if you had to leave for any reason you had to queue to get back in... Unless you walked up or down the escalators and walked in the lift from any other floor! Our group wasn't particularly happy with spending \u00a31k only to receive a service that was clearly below parr.  We choose to leave here and spent the rest of our night at a local pub - 'The Pavillion End' where we thoroughly enjoyed the rest of our night. I personally wouldn't go back to Madison's.

We sat down at 2:30 and ordered cocktails and snacky bits - although the service was slightly slow at first our server was great and the drinks and food were all superb quality. I think it must have been the Maitre D that delighted in telling us (whilst barely looking at us) that we couldn't stay past 5:30 as the table was reserved. We asked how we could reserve a table for later (knowing full well we intended to be there for the long run) - he said there was a minimum spend, didn't specify what that was but that in a nutshell we couldn't reserve.  Well this was all rubbish - as soon as we ordered a bottle of champagne the Maitre D's attitude towards us did a total 360 and he could not have been more accommodating.  We stayed on that table from 2:30pm - 11pm and had a great laugh and drank delicious cocktails whilst taking in the spectacular view.

Over looks the city with St Pauls cathedral in the foreground. You are up on the 6th floor so a great (and rare) elevated view in this part of town.  The service is good but has the slight edge of a team that has been affected by serving hedge fund and derivative types who are shouty and order the most expensive just because it is. I visited on a very hot day and the outdoor space was heaving with people desperate to look good and act cool whilst coping with 30+ degrees.  The menu is very nice indeed and I started with a tostada which was beautifully presented and tasty. The tortilla was crisp and not greasy and the filling tasty and fresh. Definitely recommend this.  I then had the chicken Caesar salad which was nice but safe. Fair size portion but no anchovies or anything else to make it stand out from the same salad you can get in most places. Nothing wrong with it, but not special either.  All the drinks were as you'd expect - cold, well presented and topped up (but not in a pushy way).  I didn't pick up the tab but felt like it was in the \u00a360-70/head bracket including drinks.  After lunch we moved to the outside bar area which by this time (about 4.30 - it was a long lunch!) was heaving and there was standing room only. This was OK but some places to stand glasses and bottles of wine would be useful.  All in all a fabulous venue, food and drinks just not my type of diner. ", "date_of_review": "28 August 2016"}

Bartender was slightly snotty with us - as a group of students we all paid for drinks separately and he didn't seem impressed by having to make each one separately which made us feel embarrassed.

You can't take your drinks to look at the view of St. Paul's so that's a waste of time unless you grab a quick photo before you get a drink!

The restaurant was superb although I found some of our guests trying to maintain & keep their make up from slipping on my face and resembling someone who had been out in 30 degree heat.  Air conditioning Madison it's something that helps your restaurant keep cool in heat and guess what it pumps out cold air!!, yes revolutionary but keeps customers happy and some of those beautiful ladies from showing exactly what they may look like in the morning (not chewing your arm off when you realise what they look like in reality!). I jest, it is a beautiful crowd, potentially looked like some who you may be hired if you know what I mean. Very beautiful girls, but actually started to feel a bit sorry for the male species. The overwhelming perfume, extensive legs and the flicks of hair with eyes as sharp as hawks looking for their victims....., I mean boyfriends, husband not for life just for Christmas, it was like someone spelling out 'gold digger' to a 5 year old.

Madison is situated on the top floor of One New Change where you get views across the city as far as the south side of the river. The bar is nearly always busy and you can see why \u2013 you can either have drinks outside or inside on the sofas or have dinner or hold an event (which is the reason I was there) and sample their amazing canapes. The venue is expensive but if you have a big budget for an event through work I would highly recommended booking. Prior to the event I asked if I could sample the wines beforehand, so I could work out the correct choice in advance, and this was agreed with no fuss. I sat with Karen, one of the Events Executives so we could both have opinions on which was best \u2013 my choice after trying about 5 wasn't even the most expensive - the Sauvignon Blanc at \u00a332 a bottle. We also ordered quite a few bottles of Prosecco for the event, I didn't sample this as they are all pretty similar, there is one choice at \u00a340 a bottle. They also do a good selection of bottled beers, Peroni and Sol. The canape menu was very extensive and, when I asked, they provided me with a useful Allergy sheet should you need to cater for anyone with gluten or dairy intolerances. From the canapes I can recommend, in particular, the Parmesan Shortbread, chutney and goats cheese, Truffled arancini with smoked mayonnaise, Scotch quail egg with mustard mayo and from the dessert menu the passion fruit mousse which was a delicate cone of chocolate in a gold wrap and a liquid mousse and was impressive to look at and to taste, we also sampled the chocolate pave with praline which was not too rich and you can't go wrong with the macaroons \u2013 as good if not better than the ones you get in Pauls bakery! The service was also extremely impressive, our waiter, Danilo was speedy and efficient and really did the work of two so to have someone exclusively to help you pour drinks and check the food is en-route was crucial. As there are not many roof top terrace bars in the City with that much space outside it is a highly recommended venue to try when sunny or inside as the views are just as good if not better. I would recommend you go as a couple for a romantic dinner or cocktails with friends or book an event if you have large budget as Madison will not fail to impress your guests!", "date_of_review": "16 June 2016"}

In addition, she was always nice and smiling throughout the night \u2013 which made her service even more pleasant for everyone around. A big thank you to her. Overall \u2013 I must say we are really happy with the service, the venue and the overall quality of the experience. It is a great advantage to be able to go outside and get some hair and have an amazing view (especially as it was a bit hot inside when we arrived). Music wasn\u2019t too loud and people around were a pleasant public. Would definitely come back again. Thank you to Freya Parsons who helped with the pre-booking and the post, ensuring we were satisfied with the service.", "date_of_review": "19 June 2016"}

We enjoyed our nice cocktails on the Terrace until it started raining really hard. I must say that the waiters and musicians were so quick in getting everything out of the Terrace and accommodating everyone inside that I was surprised. We had a really great night here.

So not what you'd call cheap, but that wasn't the point.  We arrived at 2pm for our reservation at 2.30 and had a drink whilst waiting for perpetually late friends. I had a brilliant Pinot Gris by the glass.  There was a great feel to the place all day, and it was great to watch the skyline change as the weather and light varied. Service and food fantastic, a good band started to play later in the afternoon. We paid the bill at 7.30 and finally staggered out at 8pm so unsurprisingly the bill was a tad high...

Without going into too much detail regarding the initial problem we had an area booked at Madison for a friends birthday on bank holiday Sunday. The events lady we dealt with made a big mistake and despite booking our table for 20.45 and being assured the venue would be open late we were told only a few days before the event that the venue actually closed at 9pm on bank holiday Sunday.  We were obviously extremely angered by this so I contacted the Senior Manager at D&D London (company who own Madison) called Brian and told him about the problem. He was quite honestly fantastic and completely turned my opinion of Madison around. He apologised profusely for the mistake and was very understanding as to the problems it had caused us. We exchanged a few emails and managed to come to an agreement to hold my friends birthday drinks earlier in the day and then go on elsewhere afterwards.  When we arrived at Madison on Bank Holiday Sunday we were greeted by a friendly member of security and took the glass lift to the rooftop. We were then shown to our outside table area which had heaters, plenty of seating and a breathtaking view of St Paul's Cathedral. Our waitress for the evening was brilliant, very attentive and constantly ensuring our bubbles were kept topped up. The cocktails at Madison are AMAZING!!! You simply must try a 'rooftop' if you go and the 'porn star martinis' are also stunning. We ordered a few plates of bar food to share between us and these were all delicious - not at all like regular bar food. The buttermilk chicken came out with two dips and was big hearty pieces of chicken breast in yummy crispy breadcrumbs. The truffle chips were also to die for.  There was a lively jazz band playing on the Sunday we visited which provided a great, chilled atmosphere along with the beaming sunshine and lovely cocktails. I have visited Madison a few times previously for work events and normally on a Friday/Saturday they have a house DJ playing which gives the place a really great Ibiza style buzz. Price wise Madison is pretty average for a high end London bar. The cocktails are around \u00a310 each and you can get a glass of house wine for \u00a36, understand this may seem pricey for some people but for London this is very normal. Because of the mix up with our booking the minimum spend on our area was waived but normally to reserve an area you are looking at about \u00a370 per person minimum and you do need to put down a holding deposit.  To summarize you simply must visit Madison if you are after a cool, lively, beautiful venue to have a few drinks in London. It is particularly amazing in the summer so go grab your Ray-bans and get yourself a rooftop cocktail!", "date_of_review": "3 June 2016"}

You will need a reservation. There is an outdoor rooftop that was clearly popular with 20 somethings. And many wearing \"smart\" or upscale attire so don't wear jeans or casual attire. Believe there is a dress code. My small Cesear salad, side fries and 2 glasses of wine totaled \u00a360 or $80. I will let you be the judge whether you think this merits the price.

His body language and facial expressions definitely told us that he didn't like us, so he said we were not allowed to go the the Rooftop Terrace.  We were all suitably dressed for the occasion. We did not have old T shirts on, ripped jeans or dirty trainers with holes in.  This 'bully' completely ruined our afternoon. He took an instant dislike to us for no reason at all. He singled someone out in our group (of 4) and to be honest if we had showed him any style of shoe he would have refused us entrance.  We were completely shocked by his attitude.

When I saw the view I was really excited. The price of the food was a little higher than I'd normally pay so I imagined a fancy restaurant with lovely views.  Bit of a pretty woman moment at the start when I joined the restaurant entrance queue - only for a security guard to sarcastically bark that \"uh there is a queue!\" I obviously looked to unpolished to go to the restaurant and it was assumed I was meant to be in the queue for the view with tourists.  Sadly the restaurant was dark, music was very loud and they had squeezed as many people as possible in to the restaurant. It felt like we were eating in a nightclub. This was disappointing but I'm not that old yet, so we projected our voices and embraced the atmosphere. Whilst eating you are surrounded by men and women on some sort of mating safari. Not interested in eating, just drinking and hunting. This place needs to be a testosterone filled bar or a restaurant- not both  The food was ok, nothing to mention. They forgot two of our sides, one of which arrived when we had finished. They didn't charge us for these though.  Staff were busy and friendly.  They automatically add the service charge to the bill. Something that infuriates me. Earn it don't assume it. Especially when our order wasn't correct.  Basic food, ok price for London. Excellent views.

Snootiness at it's best. A girlfriend and I went there on a busy, sunny Friday evening. It wasn't madly busy but busy enough. However, good staff should still acknowledge you and apologise for the wait. We must've been there a good 30 minutes; the 1 roaming waiter was very well aware (because he surly told me I was standing in the wrong place and getting in his way.) we were there, waiting for him to come over but he didn't bother. I then went to the outside bar and saw the poor single cocktail barman painstakingly making cocktails for someone 3 people in front of me. Why did they only have 1 guy on cocktails?? So we move through to the restaurant bar. Stood there for a few minutes staring at the guy cleaning glasses. He looks up a couple of times and on the third glance, tells us to move, literally 3 feet to our right, to get served. I don't think I've ever felt that unwanted in a restaurant/bar before. So my friend and I decided to take our fat, overflowing wallets (you wondered what I was going to say then didn't you!) downstairs at Searcy's champagne bar. Sadly that wasn't much better service even though it was empty. Maybe City bar staff are treated really badly by City workers... who knows. All I know is, Madison is not getting a second chance from me or any of my friends or anyone else I can possibly tell. Go up there with your own drinks and enjoy the view.

It's the 12.5% service charge, that I'm always willing to pay when it is worthy and general, 'how was your meal?'that goes a long way with customers. Nor was there any question of why some of the meals had not been touched (don't order the duck.)

It is one of the few open top bars west of the City and has a nice view.

It has a pretentious policy where you have to pay huge deposits to book tables for the pleasure of sitting down in the covered section, which is like a greenhouse, and the staff treat those who attempt to sit in a seat they haven't reserved with utter contempt. On busy days, everyone is packed into small, roped off areas outside so you don't get to see any views. Or you are jostled about in the covered area while the staff go past with drinks and food. Drinks are expensive and difficult to secure as the staff are so harassed. Banging dance music is played outside (music I happen to like) but it's so loud, you can't hear people speak. I haven't eaten there for a while so can't comment on the food but the bar puts me off eating there.

I asked my husband to find us somewhere for \"Lunch, with a view.\" This did not disappoint. It's not particularly well signposted - just take the central lift to the 6th floor.  The rooftop has an outdoor section with canopies overhead so you can sit out in the fresh air while being shielded from the summer sun. Unfortunately it is still spring, and the Sunshine hasn't yet put in a proper appearance - heavy rain was the order of the day. Inside, there is a section for drinks with comfortable sofas, or standing tables - right next to a spectacular skyline view of London, overlooking St Paul's Cathedral. Then there is a restaurant - a variety of tables, some with sofa-style seating, others with chairs, but all with black gloss tables.  We were greeted by some friendly ladies in scarlet dresses who showed us to our table. Almost the only thing I can fault is that the tables, for an intimate lunch, are just sightly too close together. I could hear literally every word that the tables either side of us were saying. The starters we chose - Pork pressa, baked scallops - were both absolutely delicious. Loved both the flavours and the textures of the baked scallops - the crunchy shards of bacon coupled with the scallops and then the smooth celeriac puree were just divine, and really well seasoned. The mains - triple duck burger, slow roasted lamb flatbread - were both extremely tasty. The lamb flatbread though absolutely delicious promised a \"mint slaw\" which was unfortunately a bit lost when next to the red cabbage in the flatbread. The turmeric and cumin on the lamb was quite subtle. Don't get me wrong - I ate the entire lot. It's only on reflection and re-reading the menu in order to write this review that I've come to these conclusions. The side order of purple sprouting broccoli was a welcome accompaniment too.  Being satisfied and not wishing to become uncomfortably stuffed, we opted for coffee/tea rather than dessert. Next time we go back, we will be trying out the dessert menu - I noticed there are two options for cheese fanatics on the dessert menu, one of them is a baked camembert. That I cannot wait to try. The service was discreet, yet attentive. Waiters were available should we need anything, but not hovering. Perfect. There was an optional service charge added to the bill. I really didn't begrudge paying it, because the service was great - Thanks Helga! All in all, there will definitely be a next time.

Reading other reviews the suggestion of Sunday lunch with live jazz might have been better suited to our needs. Food generally competent but considering the price and reputation really quite average and lacking a certain something. Waffles for two of us for dessert were burnt. I left mine and when this was mentioned to staff the charge was removed from the bill with polite apologies and no fuss.

Additionally, the customer service from the Madison's Facebook page is appalling, I asked a couple of very simple questions that any employee should know the answer to (e.g. what is the minimum spend for reservation of a table at the bar?) and was sent a reply which told me to contact the venue by phone. What a joke. The cocktails and view were lovely but Madison's needs better staff.", "date_of_review": "5 April 2016"}

My friend and I originally came up for some cocktails in the early evening after another friend of mine suggested Madison and ended up staying for dinner also. The venue is amazing and the staff are all flawless, maintaining a perfect balance of light/casual and professional/formal.  The bartender at the cocktail bar (Artyom was his name) was superb and my only regret about eating in the restaurant is that I couldn't have more drinks from Artyom. After being seated by Zaini we were served by Rasmy and Romina who must love their jobs more than life itself! I'm quite friendly and chatty which usually doesn't sit well with staff that just want the day to end but everyone was super friendly and helpful, making great suggestions for drinks and food and seemed to be invisible yet suddenly appear the moment you needed something (how Rasmy produced two salt and pepper shakers out of thin air I'll never know). At the end of the meal I requested to speak to the manager and was shocked when Darrio came over to the table for me to give feedback; I'd thought he was just another member of staff because of him running around and seeing to anything that required attention (he even served our table a few times) which I think is splendid; Darrio must be a great team leader to work with because of how humble and chilled he is. The venue itself is so good; how they managed to pull off such a classy ambience whilst still being so relaxed and casual I'll never know but it works a treat! Some beautiful views of London and space to move around so you're not feeling claustrophobic like in other places where they try to squeeze in a table in every aisle and doorway. Prices are not high at all either (anyone that thinks they are obviously doesn't eat out much in London). Definitely coming back here and soon!", "date_of_review": "15 March 2016"}

Must admit - the ability to walk around and soak up the beautiful views from the rooftop make arriving well before your reservation quite worthwhile. However, once we were seated, all of the joy disappeared. You are immediately assaulted with the pointlessly self-important vibe of the place - and unless you're seated at a window - your view isn't any better than it would be at the Wahaca downstairs.  After a few minutes our server arrived and greeted us - we asked how she was doing, amazingly she replied \"Doing really well so far, we'll see how that holds up.\"  We asked her to see a cocktail menu - which she fetched for us - and then summarily ignored us for the next 20 minutes. She collected plates from the table next to us. Took orders from a table on the other side of us... Even went so far as to sit down and join a table behind us for five minutes. Finally we had enough of being treated so terribly - once all of our party could communicate our common desire to leave over top of the pretentious house music blaring through the restaurant - we got up to leave. By this point - the host had come over to check on us and (to his credit) apologized for the wait. We told him we had decided to leave - at which point he had the audacity to look offended. Not to be outdone - the hostess collected our jackets for us and asked us how our meal was... apparently not realizing she had just seated us.

Drinks including prosecco were great although one of my party said that the Americano coffee was not very nice.  The view across London are some of the best I've seen and the bar looked lovely.

Great views and always a good busy atmosphere, although be prepared to queue for around half an hour to get in on especially nice days. Pints of Peroni are about \u00a36 a pop including service which isn't horrendous for this type of venue. Also came here for my birthday meal in September. Service was quick and food was good (my father particularly enjoyed his steak). The restaurant was loud though and it's quite difficult to have a conversation on a large table without shouting. This is because the eating area isn't particularly separate from the bar area so the lively atmosphere extends into the restaurant. It was all very good but based on pure dining experience there are places further up my list but will continue to come for drinks and looking forward to doing so when the weather improves.", "date_of_review": "30 January 2016"}

We asked for a table and were told by the most arrogant little man that he would have to check if there was a table available\u2026.there are about 25 tables in the restaurant area and only three of them were occupied at the time. One of my American friends just laughed and said \" you're kidding me right\u2026the place is empty!\"\u2026but off he strutted and returned a few minutes later saying \"yes\" there was a table available\u2026which we could have as long as we ordered a \"main\" each. We all just laughed at the silliness of the situation. We already had a glass of wine each whilst waiting in the lounge area to the side of the restaurant \u2026which is quite nice with a good view of St Pauls. The food is edible but in very small quantities \u2026I ordered their burger and it was like something for a kid\u2026served on what looked like a wooden Bread board\u2026.the burger was tiny\u2026my friends again laughed and joked we would have to got to McDonalds afterwards. They were on their second glass of wine each and they both noticed that the wine was served in the wrong size glass ( a very large glass) making it look like a half glass of wine\u2026possibly to make you buy more??? I went to the mens room and noticed it was dirty and untidy\u2026badly painted, the doors are all chipped and roughly patched up particularly in the inside, both the sinks were cracked and the hand dryer was hanging off the wall by its electrical wires. The bill was very costly for what we had and we suspected it was mostly made up of the wine bill as they charge a lot of a basic glass of wine. The mains are about \u00a315 each. I feel this place is mainly carters for the boring suit types who don't really care about value or their surroundings.

We were also given blankets by the staff which made for a lovely romantic setting. Looking out over St Paul's Cathedral was just amazing. The photos we took are great but I still don't think it does the view justice.  I don't think the drinks are that expensive either, especially taking into consideration the location of this bar! We had a large glass of mulled wine for \u00a36. The actual bar area is very small so I expect the queues when it is busy to be extraordinarily long. However, even if you stop by for one drink it is totally worth it. A must visit bar in the centre of London. I can guarantee you will not be disappointed!  I would love to come back and visit the restaurant. It look lovely.", "date_of_review": "17 December 2015"}

Lovely selection of cocktails but unfortunately time ran out before we got to order dessert, however, Antonio informed us that we could have dessert on the rooftop terrace!  We weren't sure that it would work with the cold weather but we made our way over. The security guard on the terrace greeted us so warmly, I wish I got his name! He showed us to a sofa complete with heaters and even fleece blankets!  We orders dessert from the same restaurant selection and more cocktails, of course.  The view was amazing, the staff at the terrace were amazing and even treated us to a complimentary birthday shot!  We are already talking about when we can return. It's an obvious summer destination but I can honestly say that it's just as great in the colder months. Service in both the restaurant and the roof terrace was wonderful.

Rest of our group arrived, not a flicker of recognition from the 2 girls I'd spoken to twice in the previous 15 minutes. Yes, we could sit to one side of the restaurant and have drinks over lunch menus. So we sat and sat and SAT. We asked if we could possibly order those drinks and SEE the lunch menus after waiting 25 minutes. Yes, we could. 10 minutes later our drinks order was taken, and yes they would bring some lunch menus. 10 minutes later we asked again to see the food menus. 15 minutes later, we asked to go to our table and when would our drinks arrive! Place still fairly empty. Ten minutes later, please could we ORDER FOOD!! Then drinks arrived. Food was not too long after. Music track was a repetitive beat dirge - pretty awful to be honest. Seats and restaurant were otherwise comfortable. Food was interesting, a bit different which was welcome; and some of it was pretty good. BUT, the experience of service was unacceptable. It wasn't rude or offensive; just vacant and absent.... as in 'yes, of course' then no follow up delivery. Not once or thrice but consistently ... absent!

Upon arrival we were asked if we wanted a drink at the bar first, but as my daughter was on a lunch break, we decided to sit at the table straight away. We were shown the drinks menu and given the food menu at the same time. We opted for the Sileni, Sauvignon Blanc, which is my daughter's favourite and also had tap water. The waiter gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted to eat and I went for the Jerusalem artichoke. My daughter had the prawn and lobster cocktail and my friend the salt baked kohrabi and poached pear salad. All were delicious. For mains my daughter and I had the 35 day aged rib eye steak with truffle fries and my friend the Madison fish pie. My steak was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. We had another bottle of wine but no sweet and then made our way out onto fantastic roof terrace, which has amazing views over London, As it was a clear day, we could see for miles and as the evening drew in, the lights of the London Eye and OXO Tower and other landmarks were dazzling.  We then started drinking the cocktails which were lovely, but the Porn Star Martini wasn't the best I have had. The Pina colada was probably the best I have had though.

My girlfriend booked a table in advance with a \u00a3250 deposit and everything seemed to be fine with the woman whom she booked with. I am a trader in the city and go Madison regularly on a Thursday and Friday night. Upon arrival, I approached your door staff to let them know I had a table booked. He swiftly said I would not be let in due to the fact I was with 5 boys. My girlfriend was not told that upon arrival it had to be a mixed group, we were calm and all dressed very respectively. I was then told to get the same number of girls therefore we could be \u2018whisked\u2019 up to our table. My girlfriend and her party came in which we were then told there was too many of us to fit onto our table. I was asked if I would like to get another table to fit all of the guests onto which I said yes no problem too. I was then yet again shot down and denied entry. I had some friends that travelled from Buckinghamshire and the night on a whole took a lot of planning on my behalf and others. As you can imagine, I was very frustrated with the situation as most Fridays I go Madison bar with no problem and the one night I booked a table, I get denied entry into your venue in which could I state is a Bar and not a club therefore it is pretty harsh turning people in the way you did. I had no attitude towards your door staff and really just wanted to celebrate my birthday. Also my partner went upstairs to speak to a manager regarding the situation, she was told lot of untruths ie. The Manager didn\u2019t know we had arrived for our table and no one was informed, then another member of staff (manager) told my partner he doesn\u2019t understand the problem and our table is waiting for us. He then disappeared on the headset, came back and told my partner that he heard my guests and I on the radio headset that we was going to another club which was a complete lie, no one said that or told the staff downstairs this. This is so unprofessional and disgusting behavior that a bar could not give us a reason on why we had been declined entry. My girlfriend was refunded the money however my night was ruined and I was given no explanation as to why I was not let in and felt pretty embarrassed in front of all my friends. If guys need to arrive with girls upon arrival then you need to state it very clear in your policy or send an email out once a booking is confirmed. As I said, the night took a lot of planning and it was ruined. I am very disappointed in the way I was treated by your door man and I know that you have a very extremely successful bar and may not even take my complaint seriously, you should not treat people like this!", "date_of_review": "9 November 2015"}

Firstly, this restaurant isn\u2019t for people who are looking for a \u201cquiet, relaxed atmospheric restaurant\u201d, Madison is not that! The views are fantastic, especially outdoor, very picturesque and I loved the lively atmosphere of place. We had drinks first, with plenty of tasty cocktails to choose from, followed by dinner. The food was pleasant but I would say it was average for what it was, especially when we got the bill, I thought it was pricey for pretty standard food. Although I must say the food was not bad, just don\u2019t expect to be blown away with the menu. Madison is a great place for drinks and if you fancy it dinner too. I would certainly recommend it for its very lively atmosphere. It\u2019s a busy place full of small and large groups of people and loud music, so it\u2019s more of a \u201cbar\u201d that does sit down food rather than a chilled restaurant.

I'm no expert but I know enough about what I'm ordering and what to expect. I ordered a C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne 2012 I was presented a 2014 which I refused upon being shown it. I was then presented with a 2013 which again wasn't what was shown on the menu nor what I wanted. I suggested that I'd accept the 2013 but at a reduced price this too was refused. I selected an alternative a 2012 Italian Barbera I was presented with yet another incorrect vintage a 2014 I again refused.  I was given a story that the wines were the same just a different year. As a wine drinker with some understanding and knowledge this is obviously an absurd thing to suggest. I was then told the oldest red wine they had available was 2014 except the single bottle of 2013 Rhone which they were unwilling to discount. They blamed the supplier and the menu printing. Regardless of where the fault lies the service and how the matter was dealt with was poor. Madison is a D and D Restaurant and I have followed the careers of the proprietors David and Des for sometime. I find their restaurants usually excellent hence I regularly attend them and seek new ones out when in a different part of town. Madison falls a long way short of expectation and is no where near the other establishments standards. That said the food was good and the service was generally good although the overall decor needs some attention, the place looks a little tired.

It is a very popular venue for drinking on most nights of the week in the City, especially Thursdays and Fridays. The queues for the lifts to reach this venue is staggering, and you can wait for up to 90 minutes to get in.  When you are up there, I have to say the views are amazing of St Pauls - worth a trip in the day when it isn't so busy just to get a glimpse of this amazing building. The drinks are ok but can be very expensive and if you want to reserve an area there is an minimum spend depending on if it is inside or outside. I may sound negative in this review, but I have been a couple of times both day and evening and each time I found it just a little O.T.T, but then again a lot of people like it so try it for yourself.", "date_of_review": "8 September 2015"}

The staff were extremely welcoming towards our quite large group of 7, (which included a young baby, yet there was no fuss about providing a high chair), it seemed like they just wanted us to feel as comfortable as possible. In particular our waiter for the afternoon who I believe went by the name Maciej was the perfect example of how restaurant service should be- friendly, warm and witty yet not overbearing or intrusive.  As it was a celebration the staff made sure to include lots of nice touches like free shots for our table, serving my dessert with sparklers and even giving me a congratulatory card from the Madison's team which I actually thought was very sweet; all in all they made the meal feel very special for me without it being overly cheesy or forced like it can be in other food places. The food was really lovely and there was a varied menu, make sure to also try their cocktails because they were also amazing and big on flavour. Yes, the bill at the end was pretty hefty and this place couldn't exactly be described as cheap, but the food, service and gorgeous view of St Pauls means the experience is very much worth it.

He replaced the steak with a rib eye, which was okay. We also order the 1.3kg Lobster to share between another 2, the lobster was over cooked, very dry and far too chewy. We complained about the steak because it was so bad, but couldn't really complain about anything else. But we should of gone to B&L across the road and just arrived at Madison for drinks....

It's a great place to have a beer & watch the sunset & make the most of London's summer.  However, the waitresses are some of the rudest I've ever known. My friends & I were standing inside having a few drinks & every now & then I'd feel an actual small push as one of the waitresses barged past. All night they made a big deal of ordering us to move over to the side a bit more (it was very busy as per most places in the city on a Friday night) until we were practically sitting on the back of a sofa. There was no need for this persistent nagging given there was PLENTY of space for them & others to get past. In fact, I was only ever shoved slightly by that one waitress whilst the customers seemed to walk through fine!  At the beginning of the night we were rather rudely told to \"move!\" when a waitress was pulling out the ropes for the VIP seating area. We had no problem in moving but all night the staff (excluding the bar staff who were so lovely & fun!) spoke to us, a group of well-mannered professionals, like we were nothing and that actually they could do without us being there.  The staff need to learn how to be polite to their CUSTOMERS, the whole reason they have their job in the first place, and to rid themselves of the pretentiousness & utter rudeness they currently possess. When asking customers to move, put their things in a cloakroom or any other request they have, perhaps they could learn to request it with a smile rather than barking orders at people. I will try this place once more because the views are stunning and the atmosphere the DJ created outside on the terrace was great.  But if the staff can't match the venue I'm sure there's plenty of other great rooftop bars in London to spend your well-earned money. ", "date_of_review": "8 August 2015"}

I hadn't realised quite how \"trendy\" it was, so this definitely has coloured my experience, to be fair. When we got there, we had to wait in a long queue in the downstairs mall, even though we had reservations. Then we went up and tried to get to the outdoor bar to get a drink. It was PACKED with city types braying so loudly you couldn't hear anything. We got drinks after about 20 minutes and then tried to retreat to the outside rooftop terrace where there were almost no people, only to be informed by beefy security guards that you couldn't take drinks out there and had to stand like a cow behind the ropes, shoulder to shoulder with the suits most with two drinks in their hands so they didn't have to go back to the bar that often, being bumped and jostled.  It was a bit better when we went into the restaurant, but there is no view of St Pauls from there, which is what we came for, and our table was in the middle, so we really didn't have a view of anything. (We had asked for a table with a view when booking.)  They gave me a very nice birthday card (though it had my husband's name on it since the reservation was in his name) and a small shot of vodka with crushed raspberries which was nice. The food was OK, but not that special. The buttermilk fried chicken was what I thought was best. Our waiter was nice, but it felt like he had been told to act in a particular way since we were presented with a card at the end with his name and asked to give a review. It seemed a bit artificial. Afterwards, we went out on the terrace (sans drinks or food) and took a panorama pic to look at later and then we left. Madison claims to bring \"a slice of modern Manhattan to London\". I have lived in New York and it is not really that much like the rooftop restaurants there which tend to be quieter and a bit more \"sophisticated\", for want of a better word.

We expected something a bit special and although the food, cocktails and the Wimbledon set up with deck chairs and the matches being shown on the big screen were brilliant, the restaurant staff and the toilets (both inside the restaurant and off the terrace) massively let the place down. We sat out on the terrace for a couple of hours before our booking and the views over St. Pauls didn't disappoint. That being said, the toilets available for the terrace were in some dingy back stairwell and were filthy and stinking, and on top of that there was neither a hand dryer or any paper towels to dry your hands. When we moved inside the restaurant, the loos in there weren't much better. Two of the three ladies cubicles were out of order because they weren't flushing and all the spare paper towels and toilet rolls were stacked up in the corner looking messy. When inside, we were seated at a ridiculously wobbly table and weren't offered any help to straighten it, just told that it was because of the floor. Also, the wine of another table was placed in our ice bucket by a waitress, with no explanation as to what was going on or asking us if we minded. It wasn't really an issue in itself but we were unsure as to whether they were bringing us a new bottle although we hadn't ordered it. It was all just a bit confusing. As well as that, disappointingly, one of the many waiters serving our table was quite rude throughout the meal. I tried to catch his eye to get him to come over and although he saw me I had to fully wave him over before he came to the table. When we were ready for desert, he then waved the menu in front of my face whilst I was having a conversation with my friend opposite, to get me to take it from his hand instead of just lying it on the table. He was just continuously interrupting our conversations and seemed to be being unnecessarily difficult.

One week on colleagues are still talking about the night and how much fun it was. Granted, we were very lucky with the weather but it made the back drop of St Paul's the ideal setting for our event.  The Madison team were efficient and professional throughout the whole night and ensured everyone always had a drink, something to eat and were enjoying the entertainment.  The DJ set the scene and instantly brought a buzz to the party, the band that then played raised the bar even higher. They sounded great, many not realising there was a live singer till we pointed it out, then came along the dancing to their bongos! The inside was very warm due to lack of A/C but Madison accommodated us by setting out two large fans that offered some relief in the heat. As the evening cooled so did the venue and by then it was not something we even paid attention to.  The event team, ran by Lucy, met all our needs and kept us in the loop at all times during the evening. There was a slight technical glitch but this was sorted out within a very short amount of time with very little impact. Very much recommend Madison as a party location, for whatever it is you are celebrating. This met our business requirements perfectly.  Great views, brilliant music & a fantastic atmosphere!", "date_of_review": "10 July 2015"}

The main wasn't quit what I have hoped for and was on the small size but was ok. Staff friendly and efficient and the place soon got busy.

We arrived about 6.30 and the roof terrace and restaurant were full of people so the atmosphere was very noisy and frenetic. The staff were quick to seat us at our reserved table and get our first drinks order while we viewed the menu. The selection is not huge, but I am sure everyone would find something to interest them. We started with some small sharing dishes of nuts, olives and goats cheese popcorn (delicious). I chose the baby back pork ribs (9 pounds) as a starter - the ribs and BBQ sauce were excellent but it was a pretty large portion - I would have been satisfied with about half of the ribs, so don't choose this if you are not hungry. Followed up with a rib eye steak (28 pounds) and fries ( additional 4 pounds), which was cooked exactly as I ordered. A number of colleagues had chosen the sole and pronounced it delicious. A couple had gone for the tagliatelle and were a little disappointed in the small sized portion for this dish. For desert I had the chocolate martini at 9 pounds, which I felt was extremely overpriced for a fairly indifferent cocktail. Can recommending both the Sauvignon Blanc and the Malbec which were both pretty good value at 28 pounds each. Overall I enjoyed the food - service was friendly and efficient, but I felt the prices were a little high for some of the items on the menu. I might return to Madison and would recommend you give it a try, but perhaps not for a quiet romantic dinner given the \"club like\" atmosphere and noise levels.", "date_of_review": "17 June 2015"}

When we got to the 6th floor there were loads of people in trainers, jeans and even scruffy converse. One bloke was wearing shorts and tshirt like he had just come from the beach. That immediately put my back up that the bouncer had picked us to be funny with. We queued to get a drink for a few minutes, but at other times in the night there was at least a ten minute wait to get served. The only draught beer they have is Peroni, so not much choice there. For a pint of Peroni and medium house white wine it was \u00a313. Ok I guess I was expecting that but it made me think we could have a nicer time elsewhere and spend a lot less. The client\u00e8le here are generally \"show offs\" and \"city boys\" which really isn't my thing.

The interior design seems to have been freshen up and upgraded giving it a more classy feeling.  The best and most important improvement is the food. 18 months ago it was okay but not amazing whereas now it is very good ! All thanks to the new chef. We had for starter the soft shell crab, soup and pork ribs, and 3 burgers for main, mine including a duck breast patty.

We were asked to come back in 10 mins. Came back and were ignored by at least 4 staff before a member of staff put her phone away (down her top!) and paid attention to us.

You definitely need a reservation. You access the restaurant on the 6th floor by means of lifts in the middle of the shopping centre. Last night, one of the two was broken - not great! There's a queue for the general public to get up - can take forever. TOP TIP: if you have a reservation for the restaurant, go to the man at the front and tell him - you can skip the queue!  When you get upstairs, the restaurant is the right, cocktail bar to the left. The restaurant was, I thought, surprisingly small? But absolutely fine! I liked the food - thought it was well made and decent portions. My girlfriend was less impressed with her choices. The jury is out on that one... but it is more of a place to go and socialise.  Throughout, there was loud music provided by resident DJ. No vocals. It sounded to me as if the music never changed, it was always the same - indistinguishable! Maybe I'm too old for this kind of thing... Drinks were (for location) reasonaby priced. Glass of wine was \u00a35 - 7, prosecco \u00a37, champagne \u00a311. I think they could whip up any kind of cocktail you wanted. The crowd when we were there was a huge variety. Older men on the pull, gaggles of giggling women, very international flavour to the clientele.  Views are excellent - once it goes dark, beautiful. But too noisy to be romantic?

We had some great olives as nibbles and then my friend had a hamburger and I had the Londoner sausage. Both dishes were tasty and filling. I really liked the fries with truffle oil too. My friend tried a glass of the pinot grigio and I had a glass of the Malbec which I really enjoyed. Feeling a bit full we shared a passion fruit parfait which was lovely and light.

We promptly ordered our drinks, small bites and starters. We happily enjoyed our conversation and the whole dining experience as this was a special moment. Drinks were fine but food we all say mediocre. From the moment we arrived at the restaurant, to the time we have ordered our drinks and food no one bothered to ask how we are, neither made us aware of any time policy. When it's time to order our main course, we were told that it is impossible as we have only 30 minutes left and we needed to vacate the place. No vivid explanation conveyed to us nor the 2 hours limit were not also mentioned during booking. At this moment we are all shocked and upset. This is suppose to be a night to remember but was a disaster. We felt pressured, scrambled and awful. As we are all professional and we'll mannered, therefore challenging and arguing at this moment is out of our vocabulary. We paid, and left the place with disgust. The whole experience was halted by the restaurant lack of communication, respect, attention to detail and this is a place of no care and maximum profit. The whole place is a slurp of nothing and the service was by no slender meaning of the word ATROCIOUS. We are not coming back nor reccomed this place at all!!!! ICE", "date_of_review": "25 May 2015"}

We were a party of 8 in total and we had the best night we have had in a long time. This was the first time we had been and was recommended to us by a good friend. We had a bite over the road before going to Madison's. We walked over to the entrance afterwards, and entered the glass lift which took us up to the roof terrace bar. The moment we stepped out the most amazing view of the London skyline took our breath away as we were not expecting it. St Paul's cathedral was literally a stones throw in distance.  The security team were very friendly and professional with customers and guided us to the reception area to confirm our table booking. We also had a friendly conversation on the way with one of the security employees and were treated very respectfully as customers. I waited for a very short moment even though the venue was extremely busy. We were shown to our table and introduced to our waitress Laura who looked after us all night ensuring we had everything we wanted and kept topping up our drinks. As the evening progressed the ladies wanted to sit outside on the terrace rather than inside and they arranged this in moments. We also met two of the managers in the course of the evening, Raba and Imad. They were very friendly and arranged for our drinks to be brought outside onto the terrace.  We really enjoyed ourselves at Madison's. It has a fantastic vibe with music played by a DJ playing House music through a great sound system. I would highly recommend this venue for a great night out. I will definitely be coming here again and will also like to try the food next time! :)))", "date_of_review": "17 May 2015"}

The views are great, the balcony areas cleverly designed to keep out the wind, and the staff are all amazing; they are helpful, friendly and eternally good natured. Drinks are good, the wine list is fun, and if you stay to eat, the food is always good. The indoor area has plenty of comfy couch areas by the windows \u2013 ideal spaces to chill and gaze over St Paul\u2019s and the south skyline of the city. Whoever put this restaurant and bar together has designed a winner. And here\u2019s the problem \u2013 the thronging crowds come, and there simply aren\u2019t enough of the lovely staff to cope. They aren\u2019t filing their nails I can tell you. They are endlessly running around trying to keep punters stocked with nibbles and wine, but there would need to be about three times as many of them to have a hope of coping. You will easily wait 20 minutes for your drinks. If you opt to buy them yourself at the bar, rather than use the charming table service, you will queue for even longer. The same problem with the food \u2013 I assume the chef s are as overburdened as the floor staff and the bar staff. This week, we waited rather over 30 minutes for our starter. After we finished it, we waited nearly an hour for our mains. They were delicious, by the way, very tasty indeed, but we were starving to death by then. I think my sister had eaten her own leg. I\u2019d A plea for the bill resulted in a bill \u2013 and then a 15 minute wait to pay it.  I can\u2019t blame the staff \u2013 they are working like nobody\u2019s business \u2013 but it\u2019s frustrating when the place has got everything else working so well. It\u2019s better at lunchtimes when the place isn\u2019t so heaving and you don\u2019t face such a wait, but of course it really comes into its own in the evening with the fantastic views and the sun setting over St Paul\u2019s\u2026 Madison: hire more staff!", "date_of_review": "21 April 2015"}

The behest to post a 'nice review' surely relies on that staff member being so confident of the level of service and experience their place offers that there couldn't possibly be any other type of review...? Sadly their confidence is misplaced. My experience of Madison on a sunny Saturday afternoon was decidedly mediocre. I only went for drinks, so can't comment on the food, but my review covers the drinks, service and atmosphere.  Previous reviewers have commented that if your sole reason for visiting Madison is to sup a drink with a fabulous view, you'd be better off heading elsewhere, and I'm afraid I have to agree. The terrace overlooking St Paul's is lovely but roped off from the bar area - you can't take drinks out beyond a certain point and only two or three of the tables in the seating area enjoy that view; needless to say all those tables were reserved when we arrived.  Seating is at a premium and the queues for the bar four or five people deep.  Our bartender, Will (according to the tripadvisor card) was perfectly smiley and pleasant, but goodness me took his time over the drinks. If we had ordered old fashioneds I would expect a five minute wait, but for a bottle of beer and a spritzer...? I also have HUGE issues with a bartender in a supposedly premium venue, charging double figures for drinks, who doesn't handle glasses by the stem - my friend's time was spent drinking from a glass with three great sticky, smeared thumb and fingerprints either side of her wine glass where he had squeezed fruit into her drink and then handed it straight over by the bowl.  The clientele was mainly relaxed and not quite as 'TOWIE' as other reviewers have suggested (although I was there on a weekend afternoon so maybe they come out to play later!)  The DJ on the terrace was playing great chill out tunes, but at a volume far more suited to 10pm than 4pm.  By far the worst part of the whole experience is visiting the toilets. Access is via a grubby service corridor and down a flight of stairs to just two unisex stalls - this new trend for 'shared facilities' is bizarre enough but the line of disgruntled blokes waiting behind girls in the queue to use the loos was hilarious - I dread to think what goes on in the plant pots upstairs at busier times when they can't be bothered to wait!!  A decidedly underwhelming experience. Go up for the free view from the lovely terrace - and don't bother with the rest!", "date_of_review": "13 April 2015"}

Seemed like the rest of the city had the same idea, fortunately had a reservation, as the queue for the lift looked like it might take a while! Outside area was chock-a-block full, with loud music and people enjoying the sunshine. Chose to go straight to my table and asked for a glass of champagne - prosecco was delivered. I pointed out the mistake, but was assured that is was Moet. It was prosecco. My friend arrived, ordered a glass of champagne and that is what she got. Called the waitress over again, and pointed out the colour difference. At last she agreed that it was prosecco. I received an apology and 2 glasses of champagne, but this should have been dealt with more professionally. Had spring rolls and onion bread to share as starters, fairly standard, then burgers which were fine. We were then told that we had 15 mins left at the table. The 2 hour thing is one of the most annoying ideas ever. It was clear that it was to be adhered to, so we found a seat in the bar area. This had much better views of London, so worked out well.

It's got a great view. The location is amazing. The staff are pleasant and helpful and there is plenty of them, but it does get so busy and the bar queue can be incredibly long. The outside area is really nice and in summer is awesome if you have a space. Places attract all sorts of people, and you may like being around scantily clad, heavily made up, extension wearing, acrylic nails and perma tanned, no sock wearing slip on shoe meat heads, but it is just so TOWIE in the city. Why? Is it because it's grossly overpriced? The location? The fact you can have sparkly fireworks in your belvedere vodka (classy) or is it just because this is our new generation. Who knows.

The main problem was the attitude of one the management staff, not sure if the guy was having a bad day or his cat had died but he was audibly rude to the waiting staff - who were perfectly OK - and when someone says \"lets move them on I want the tables cleaned\" within the earshot of paying customers it does not add much to the ambience.

Dserts were excellent A mix up with the bill and moving the bar tab to the main bill could have been an over charge, it was resolved, but that's trying when the background DJ was loud and it's more like a bar/club at the till.

When we were waiting for the lift another waiter came running to us asking rudly if we had paid the bill, i felt insulted and also the way she was talking towards me wasn't the appropriate. She spoke spanish, my mother tongue, instead of apologising she lied, blaming that the table bill was still opened on the till and that she was in a different shift.

Everyone gave good feedback and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was understandably very busy given the time of the year, so some people found it difficult to hear conversation; however I felt it gave a good buzzing atmosphere with a nice Christmassy feel. Furthermore, despite the business, the food came out in good time and the quality didn't suffer! Only complaint I heard from our team was the cranberry sauce was a bit bitter!  The staff were really attentive and friendly and the events team I dealt with to organise the meal were very helpful and efficient.

Firstly the positives: lovely waiting staff, great customer service, very friendly. The views are good and we very lucky to be here on a bright sunshiney day. The ceiling slopes a bit and the view depends on where you sit. But there is a fabulous viewing area outside, open to all, so take advantage of that. We were treated to a complimentary glass of Prosecco which was lovely and much appreciated. Food was OK - Burgers were good and well cooked on the outside, felt a bit mushy inside, fries somewhat greasy. I had poached pear for dessert with some rum ice cream - both were lovely.  They need to pay more attention to some of the smaller things that make a great restaurant - some of the areas looked untidy and the toilets were a disgrace. All in all though - a good place to come at the weekend.

We decided to have a main of the starter crab cakes with side order of chips. We knew the crab cakes were starters but at \u00a311 expected a little more than the tiny tasteless offerings given to us although the chips were first rate. We weren't offered any condiments and the tiny slab of guacamole went nowhere so the whole dish was very dry. The waiter who previously overheard us then took away some of the plates while my companion was still eating her chips. Incredible. We then had an unpleasant sticky toffee pudding to share which came with a heavily laced custard-only there was no mention of that on the menu. On the plus side the views are good and drinks OK.

The restaurant/bar is small and housed in 1 room with an open kitchen, there is another even smaller bar opposite on the other side of the terrace, the 'seating' area is beneath the structural supports which are at an angle so you can't actually sit in 50% of the seats, none of this area actually faces the view and neither do any of the tables, this somewhat defeats the purpose of this whole restaurant. Service is average at best, drinks are overpriced and food underwhelming, we were a party of 10 and were told we 'had' to order from a pre-set menu in advance, it's uninspiring so I chose the steak which you can only order 'rare' or 'well-done', obviously it's beyond the chef to cook it 'medium' or any other way ? I had to ask for my starter (Onion/goats curd 'Tarte tatin' dry pastry/undercooked onion) twice and also chase the drinks orders a few times. In summary go somewhere else, there are loads of 'rooftop' venues in London nowadays providing better service/food/experience, perhaps a name change from 'Madison' to 'Mediocre' would reflect a more accurate picture.", "date_of_review": "5 December 2014"}

I looked at their website and noted they had a set menu, two courses for \u00a320 or three for \u00a325 including a glass of wine. The menu looked fine and seemed like good value so I booked a table for lunch. We received a friendly welcome and were promptly shown to our table, unfortunately from where we were seated there was no view to speak of. Only a few tables are afforded a view, the best views are from outside the restaurant. We were given the a la carte menu I told our waiter that we would like to eat from the set menu, he disappeared for a minute then told us there was no set menu as it was Christmas! (2nd of December). Rather than make a fuss we ordered and ate from the a la carte menu, the food was very good as was the service but I felt ripped off as the food was so over priced. We ended up spending double what we had expected to spend. My crab cakes starter was \u00a311.00, although they were nice they were also tiny, I got two crab cakes each being only slightly bigger that a two pence piece and a dollop of guacamole. My main course of Neck of Lamb served with a small bowl of couscous was tasty but at \u00a318.00 was also over priced. The cheapest bottle of wine on the list was \u00a320.00, a 12.5% service charge was added to the bill. Most people around us appeared to be eating the burger and chips option which was a skewered burger in a bun served on a piece of wood with a very small bucket of fries on the side which is what you tend to see being served everywhere these days! The restaurant was half empty we needn't of booked, with all the empty tables it's just a shame we weren't given one with a view! A large neon sign directs you to the toilets, the gents toilet only has one hand drier which was a nuisance, I didn't expect to have to queue dry my hands. We won't be going back any time soon. If you're going for the view don't bother the public area outside has by far the best views.", "date_of_review": "3 December 2014"}

This is unfortunate, as no one there seemed to notice, and it was packed. Even in the restaurant side of the room, it wasn't unusual to see groups of five crammed around a table meant for four people. We were made to feel very welcome upon arrival. Our service was excellent. The tuna tartare starter was delicious. For the mains, the whole sea bass was my favorite. The truffle Mac and cheese was also delicious.

Me and my best friend have dined in many a london restaurant and this is still our favourite by far. We have never had trouble getting a table during the week and their booking service is fantastic. Both times we have gone for dinner when the sun is setting, into the night.  The food is absolutely incredible. Being a big foodie and having dined in may a restaurant i can safely say Madison is at the top. Not a single thing i can fault in their food. I didnt have to wait ages but they didnt rush us either despite the 2hr limit on the table. If i knew the Head Chef's name he would get recognition on here. However WELL DONE!!!!  The service is by far the best i have ever had. Me and my best friend both work in the hospitality industry so are aware of the difficulties but i must say their service is the best we have ever had. Our waiter both times was a guy named Leo. Top of the top. he provides service like none other i have ever recieved and we have been to the Shard and exclusive bars and resturants. He beats all. To say that he made my night on my birthday would be an understatment. The man deserves a pay rise!  Also although he never actually served us Angelo provided excellent advice and conversation about the different wines that Madison serves. This was unexpected but should be noted that he went out of his way to have this discussion.  Amazing Service!!! Amazing Food!!! Amazing Atmosphere!!!", "date_of_review": "6 November 2014"}

Madison is an excellent location... Fab views, great bar for socialising and good food. The tuna and mackerel tartare with a wasabi cream and \"green caviar\" was delicious. I loved all the textures in this dish especially the gentle popping of the little green balls. For the main I had the monkfish with mussels. ... This was a little surprising arriving in a little black pot. The monkfish was cooked nicely and the jus/soup was full of flavour but didn't come with a spoon... So I nicked my colleague's. Benefit of this was I got to taste the truffle mac and cheese. Which was very cheesy and rich. We were told that no one ever finishes it -Madison take the hint.... Make it a smaller portion as a starter and or keep it as a smaller main accompanying with it a salad or something. To finish of the night the pumpkin seed pie was brought out. A deconstructed little pretty thing with butter pastry, ice cream, nut brittle and a crushed pumpkin seed. The pumpkin seed flavour didn't come through but still a nice dessert.

We booked this restaurant as a friend had visited and the pictures looked good. The restaurant is open and spacious, large sofas line one wall of floor to ceiling windows. Staff were friendly and helpful. The menu was limited but it was just lunch. I like to cook so try to eat something I wouldn't make at home. The menu had 'dogs' , hot dogs seemed to be something quirky and there were 3/4 to choose from, you don't find them on the menu often. The salads were all things I do at home frequently and I didn't fancy a really big meal. My Vienese dog arrives! It was a very pink and unappetising looking hot dog sausage. It came in a dry brioche bun with a zig zag of mustard over the top. I also had a small portion of sauerkraut, deep fried shallots, a few green leaves and a little tub of string fries. The sausage had a very tough, rubbery skin and frankly was disappointing. Just to add insult to injury this cost me \u00a315. I realise you are paying for the view but frankly you would hope a restaurant in such a smart new shopping centre would be better. The other disappointment, was the really shoddy bathroom. Stalls were untidy and the flush mechanism was broken on the wall. This was a quiet Monday lunch, they had not had a lot of customers using them that morning!!

Rather than that, it is a perfect place to save your memories in a fancy style.", "date_of_review": "3 October 2014"}

They should have told us before we came and/or accommodated us since there were full areas eating on the other side of room. We ordered some fries, etc. then left early.

After having some initial confusion finding where in the mall building it is located the restaurant was, and then again upon arriving to the roof terrace which way the actual restaurant part was in, we were seated straight away. There is a relaxed glamorous feel to this place as soon as you walk in - dimly lit with a kind of trendy chilled house music playing. It seems to be a spot divided simply pretty much 50/50 those celebrating special occasions and city workers popping in after the office, so everyone is dressed well. Our table was a little cramped in next to the 2 either side of us, but it wasn't a massive issue - I'd say just be prepared to be in quite close proximity to the next table if you are in a couple. After being seated our waiter came over and asked if we were here to celebrate an occasion, we said we weren't and ordered a bottle of water to begin with.We soon understood why he had asked us this, as he then proceeded to sing consecutively to three tables around the room (songs of various birthday / romantic themes), whilst producing them with cakes complete with sparklers. He was very good, and it was a rather endearing touch but it did distract him from bringing our water, so we ended up asking another waiter as we had been waiting around 10 minutes. We went on to order the pork belly and madison burger with sides of truffle fries and macaroni cheese and it was all absolutely impeccable.  My only gripe was that the wine was kept away from the table, which I wouldn't mind, but the staff were that bit too busy to top it up when it was empty - I really like to have a full glass of wine to accompany my dinner. Too full for dessert, we opted for cocktails after our dinner and I can honestly say mine was the best pornstar martini I have ever tried anywhere. Curious about the rooftop terrace we had passed outside, we asked the waiter what the deal was and he informed us we could settle our tab or continue it at the bar, before relocating outside which was all much easier than I expected. We carried over our tab and nabbed a perfect spot on the sofa outdoors with the most stunning view of St Pauls and the whole city - truly breathtaking. We did visit on a Wednesday, and I'm certain we would struggle to even access the roof terrace on a Friday or Saturday night. Often with trendy places such as these, it can be a matter of style over substance so I was really rather pleasantly surprised to find the food and cocktails to be marvellous, and actually pretty reasonable in price considering the surroundings. I will certainly be coming back again very soon!", "date_of_review": "17 September 2014"}

I ordered two pints and as I went to pay I noticed the glassss we're not pint glasses. The barman advised me that they only served half pints (after he'd poured them) unless I went to the other bar. It would have been nice if he told me that when I asked for two pints. I then tried to pay by card, after entering my pin the bar man advised it did not go through and I would need to do it again. At this point I requested a void / declined receipt from the card machine and was told there wasn't one. I was reluctant to enter my pin for a second time to avoid being charged twice so I asked to speak to the manager. Who then comes over, not the manager but a security door man who tells me I have to enter my pin again. (I wasn't intimidated though I think that was the idea) I asked the door man to get me the manager who then comes over with the door man behind him (again trying to intimidate me and my friend) and tells me it's my fault for and that if I don't enter my pin again I will have to leave. Obviously I could do without this type of hassle when all I want is a pint and a nice view so I eventually entered my pin again, had my half pint and left. The whole experience for me was off putting and it showed me that though it is expensive and luxurious the service is certainly not value for money. The staff lack basic customer service skills which lets it down & I would expect more from the management.", "date_of_review": "13 September 2014"}

The two duty managers and all the staff on the day were absolutely amazing and made the whole experience run seamlessly. They were attentive and made sure all the guests were looked after. The event started at 13:00 and finished at 17:00 although many of us stayed on and carried on drinking cocktails/wine watching the sun set over the great view we had in the area that we had booked out. There was nothing but positive feedback from everyone including our CEO and Management Team and no complaints. The food, drinks, service, atmosphere and venue in general were all spectacular and I would highly recommend anyone who is looking to hold an event to hold here! We definitely will go back! :) Sheena (Tragus Group)", "date_of_review": "19 August 2014"}

We arrived at 7:30 after booking a table to be told that there was no booking and they only had a table for 9:20. After I explained that I wasn't willing to wait they said they'd have a table for me by 8pm. The location is brilliant but the service really lacks a personal touch. I felt as though we was forgotten about. We enquired about our table at 8:15 and was then given a table. It took ages for someone to offer us drinks and when I asked about a certain bottle of wine the staff didn't know and had to ask someone else who then just told me \"it's nice\". The food is ok, not amazing but I enjoyed it. Everything took ages to come out and there was so many people just there to have drinks that as the night went on there was people standing around our table when we was eating. I would visit again to give it a second chance but not in a Saturday night when the football's on it clearly gets too busy. ", "date_of_review": "19 August 2014"}

Had another long wait for the food and when it did arrive I wished it hadn't. All four dishes were different but we were all equally disappointed. The fish was the blandest thing Ive ever eaten! Did not want to chance a dessert due to quality of food already sampled and time for food to arrive. Asked for the service charge of \u00a325 to be removed from bill and attitude of staff was rude and unprofessional. All four diners complained and surprise surprise, no one received a reply.

I used to go to Madison for drinks very often, however I had never tried the restaurant before so I thought it would be worth giving a try. The restaurant menu is no different than any random pub's menu - the only difference is the prices are multiplied by 4.  If you live in London, you may understand it easily - you can eat a decent burger for 6 pounds, and you can get a free drink in local pubs like Wetherspoons. In Madison, you pay 20 for a burger which is burnt, and 12 for a small beer.  I had to pay 32 for a burnt burger (I couldn't eat) and my mum had pasta which was in terrible condition as well.  My father asked for the wine menu, and he chose an Argentinian wine around 50 pounds, result: we thought it was ethyl alcohol. If you want to go to Madison - do NOT eat there. Just have some cocktails and a nice view. That's it.", "date_of_review": "23 July 2014"}

He used Open Table and made a special preference for a well placed table by a window as it was a special occasion, explaining the circumstances of our London stay. He had searched for a roof top restaurant and the website had beautiful serene pictures giving the impression of an up market venue with a relaxed atmosphere suitable for good-food-loving people.  When we arrived, the address led us to a very new, expensive looking shopping mall. We noticed a queue by the lift being attended to by security guards. There was no signs to say what this was for, so we took the stairs to the next floor, in the hope that we would avoid the queue, thinking it was some sort of event. The lift would not pass the 1st floor so we went back down to ask the security guard as it was 10 minutes until our table booking. We were told that the queue was to \"get in\" to Madison but we could get the next lift as we had booked. We were then ushered like cattle into a very packed glass lift. Awful. When the doors opened at the 3rd floor, we were pushed out by the crowd of revellers only to be greeted by a very very busy, very noisy bar/club. I hoped that this was one side of the venue and that we would eat in a different part. We found our way to the restaurant desk, through crowds of drunk office workers, and had to shout to give our names to the waitress. We were then shown to a tiny table, penned in either side by more tiny tables, nowhere near a window! Overlooking a busy, noisy bar was not our idea of a romantic meal.  As we sat down, horrified at the ordeal we had set ourselves up for, an obnoxious waiter handed us a menu saying \"oh, yes, you're celebrating something aren't you? Not sure what but why not start with some champagne hey?\" I replied that we would eat first and could we just order some sparkling water, to which he said again \"aaaw, get some champagne!\" My husband replied very sternly that we would just like to see the menu at which point we were left alone. The menu was expensive and after 5 minutes of shouting to be heard over the table to each other, we decided to leave.  If you work in the city and want somewhere to drink after work so you can compare how much you earn, what car you drive and how much champagne you can drink, then this is the place for you... for everyone else, stay clear! Full of horrible, pretentious people who think that this is the place to be seen, when it's obviously just an upmarket version of a chavs night out.", "date_of_review": "6 July 2014"}

The staff were efficient, although you do sometimes have to snag them as they go by, and our food and drinks were all brought promptly. Unfortunately the day I was there they had had a fire in the kitchen so we just had tapas food which was perfectly nice. However, to be honest this is a place to go for the view which certainly sets off a nice glass of wine or beer - worth noting they do not have a huge selection of wine by the glass which is a great temptation to have a bottle!!

The closest bar tender to us was a female, the only female working at the bar at that time. She glanced over at us a few times whilst serving a customer.

So again, she finished that order, ignored us AGAIN and served the next man who literally just walked through the doors!!!! Now having been ignored 3 times and waiting for 15 minutes, this is not excusable and we honestly felt like we were being treated like we didn't matter.

Firstly, we asked if we could sit by the doors, and the hostess said we could, but then, another guy came and said it was an already booked place. After that we asked the same guy where could we sit and he told us that there were some place in the end of the room, but when we came there, it wasn't empty and the guy just said it was a mistake. So, he promised to find us another place but instead of that he just dissapeared. In the end we managed to find a place by ourselves. Well, we had some wine and cocktails ('Angel Lips') which were nice. So, I would come back here just for the amazing view and nice drinks, but not the staff who seemed not to know what was going on during that evening.", "date_of_review": "28 May 2014"}

Would be even better on the terrace in the sun!. Cocktails were good, menu choice not extensive and no dish of the day but thoroughly enjoyed our meal. Attentive service.

As we arrived, having fought through the sweaty, drunken crowds on the balcony, there was a gurning young man shouting at the receptionist about why she wouldn't charge his phone for him. We went for dinner at 7pm on a Friday, the tables set aside for dinner were all surrounded by extremely drunk people, there seemed to be at least two groups in having parties who were all standing over people trying to eat dinner. The music was pounding and the atmosphere was horrible. It might work as a bar if you like drinking in somewhere that looks like a holding pen for people too disgusting to be on The Only Way is Essex. We didn't even stay, just cancelled our reservation and went to Maison Blanc round the corner, which was really nice.", "date_of_review": "30 May 2014"}

Terrible service. When the food arrived it was average. Really don't bother paying for food here. You are paying to enjoy the view which would be lovely if they bothered to wash the windows once in awhile. Go for a drink maybe but 100% eat elsewhere.", "date_of_review": "2 June 2014"}
