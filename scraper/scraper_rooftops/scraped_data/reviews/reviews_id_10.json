Last night me and about 15 others queued to get in to this venue. Me and 3 others were stuck in the queue after the rest were allowed in and the bouncers were insisting on checking everyones ID'S , even people within our party which were 35+.  One of our group has a visual impairment and only has one eye which you can clearly see when in front of him. Because of a medical condition this has had an impact on his brain function and he sometimes has a delayed response when asked a question or involved in social interraction.  When our friend mentioned was next to be checked, the doorman got in our friends face and with an aggressive tone pertruded to shout 'who are you with', my friend couldn't anwser right there on the spot due to his condtion to which he politely asked the doorman to repeat his question and the response he got was even more aggressive and pushed himself further in to my friends face. My friend pointed to the 10+ people that were just let in, in front and us 3 behind and said i am with these guys. The doorman then said you aren't coming in your too drunk and told him to move aside. My other friend asked if she could go inside and let the others know they need to come out as we arent staying there, she was allowed to go in and the rest of the party had already paid entry and were queing for drinks.  The doorman followed her whilst leaving 2 other security there to ensure our friend didnt get in. Meanwhile the staff were prepared to let the rest of our group through who WERE visibly drunk but not our friend who wasnt drunk although they seemed to have made the most ridiculous assumption he was. The rude doorman came back and then asked what our problem was and I'm not afraid to say i lost it.  They were prepared to let us girls go in and the rest of the party but not our friend who had an visable impairment. So because our friend didn't anwser in a split second due to a condtion he was then discriminatrd against which is absolutley disgusting. I was told to 'F*@k off' by the bouncer as he was agressively shouting abuse to us all because we stuck up for our friend. He also used expletives and foul language in an aggressive way to the rest of the party. Luckily all of the rest of the party were able to get refunds from the entrance desk which meant the company had to refund 10+ entry fees all because of their awlful doormen. I Never even got in the venue but i would never even return. Disgusting indiviudals. Looking at the reviews all seems to be negatively based around your discriminating doormen, Maybe you should consider reviewing who you employ as its not a good reflection on your brand. Not Happy!!! Ruined our night and its even sadder to whitness this type of discrimination first hand, its the sort of thing you hear sbout but dont necessarily witness and tonight i am absolutely saddened and disgusted my friend was made to feel outted and singled out by your vile doormen!!! I wish i had the individuals name!!!", "date_of_review": "15 March 2020"}

He initially showed me and my husband around before we booked, and he was so lovely - he was polite, so friendly, and we felt like we had known him for ages! He made sure that things ran smoothly on the door when there was a slight hiccup with the guest list.  The security guards in the afternoon watched my car for me when I first parked up to off load items, so I wouldn't get a ticket.  I am so hot on excellent customer services, and the staff at Queen of Hoxton exceeded my expectations in every way, especially because I am such a perfectionist.

Anyways the venue is gorgeous apart from the smell, rooftop was completely cornered off apart form a tiny spot where the rude security who shouted and told us to \"f*cking move down for f*cks sake\" and when we replied asking why he was so rude he said he didn't \"f*cking care\" so....not the best experience here. However if you're a mixed group looking for some basic tunes to dance to and get wasted, come here, good place for a dance I guess, just not my cuppa tea", "date_of_review": "29 June 2019"}

The bar had a good atmosphere and even though the views on the rooftop are not famous landmarks, they are still scenic. The cocktails on the rooftop are not great, as many other reviews also mention, they are mostly pre mixed. There were two slushy machines in cocktails which could be a nicer option, unfortunately one of these had finished and the other was a tequila based drink, so not something I'd like for myself.  The price for the premixed cocktails does seem steep. There are more options for different cocktails and beers on different floors, however moving between floors is not ideal, not just due to effort but the bar is busy, so moving around is not ideal.  The bar is understandably busy, and going on a Friday night it was hard to find a good location to stand, and seating is limited. Decorations of the bar are cool, the toilets were all very interesting especially.  It's worth noting the flooring is wooden panels/decking. It's not the most high heel friendly- although even after a few drinks despite my heel falling through a few times no accidents happened!  The lower rating is purely due to the drink quality and pricing. The bar is worth a visit but maybe not for the whole night.

Unfortunately, it was awful. The bar staff were nice but the drinks were poor, they were filled with ridiculous amounts of ice, the price would be good if the drinks were better. A lot of people were unsure what was happening, there was no communication what was happening when and everybody was asking one another. Eventually, the tarot card reader began, it was not announced where she was, who she was or how we could pay, once again everyone was asking if you pay at the table or beforehand. There was a long queue for the tarot reader, a reading being 10 minutes long which is a good amount of time but the queue was long and blocking the doors. We noticed a member of staff organising for other guests who had not waited in the queue to see the tarot reader next and offering the people who witnessed this a drink as compensation. When she told us, she said it was because the tarot reader was taking so long, And our reading would be shorted to shorten the queue (price remaining the same), which made no sense as to why she brought the guests who did not queue in front of everybody else- who had waited over an hour already. However, when we received the drinks she offered as compensation, they were not what we ordered, when I say this, we couldn\u2019t even recognise the taste- it was heavily watered down and god knows what was in it- this put me off as I suffer from allergies and have to be strict on what I drink- from a bar this is extremely poor.

It was a boiling day so it must have been a nightmare cooking over a grill in that heat! I had the not dog which was delicious! Fries were good too and they do some lovely cocktails.

There was handbags flying all sides, woman's sense of territory was actually frightening. Everyone was shouting to make sure no one sat on \"their\" seats. Truly horrifying.  Movie was good - can't get much better than Grease. But the setup and organisation were awful!! The seats were so packed together, people bearly had room for their knees. Tickets were like \u00a320 or more, it's a little bit selfish. Won't return, wouldn't recommend them as a cinema.

Have to say one of the worst places I have been too in a long time. I can't see what I was charged \u00a38 for to be honest! No organisation at all. Long queues, staff with stinking attitude, no information (i.e stating that the roof is only open to smokers as the rest has been closed off) The venue itself is lacking, dark and dingy and could do with a refurbishment as for having 3 floors; only one main floor was open as the basement was closed and the roof was partly open. You could not go up on the roof to chill out as advertised as they had barricaded it off for noise reasons (fair enough, but have the decency to inform customers when your waiting 15 mins to get up there!).

No specific event, friendly bouncer checking the id and \u00a35 entrance fee. As I heard about the rooftop, we immediately went up the stairs but unfortunately it was under refurbishment for the incoming spring/summer season. My friends were impressed by the idea of a fully operative rooftop, though. Fair music selection, good sound system particularly downstairs (dance-techno) where it was less packed than at the ground level (r'n'b and hip hop). A photo booth was available in the back for a funny memory of the night. I felt the Queen of Hoxton suits 20-25 years old group of friends and couples having just fun. I frankly could not see any bored person around, that's a good sign despite the little space and large crowds. Very little prices: \u00a35 entrance fee, 2 pints for \u00a36, \u00a31 for the cloakroom (free for bags). Lollipops handed out at the end of the night! I cannot give the full 5* rating because it probably wasn't my cup of tea and the venue was a tad sticky and dirty, compared to more popular and high-end venues.

I immediately went back to get the attention of the bar staff and I said that it tasted like water. She rudely took it back and chucked it in the bin in a strop. I do not expect such service from any bar staff anywhere especially when the drinks they were selling were of such poor quality.

This takes about 30 minutes which can seem like quite a while, while your trying to hold popcorn, a blanket, drinks and some malteasers. The set up of the chairs was appalling, firstly I expected a type of deck chair type of seating but instead there was something less comfortable.  Once they had finished setting up, a man shouted 'ok go' so everyone began to make a dash for the chairs like we were in school. They were so close together and if you are small like me this made it incredibly hard to actually see the film without peoples heads been in the way. The girls in front of me were drunk and continued to take snapchats of themselves while watching the film which meant every so often I would just be staring at the back of two heads. Beware if you are a non smoker, we had a man sitting next to us who probably went through about 5 cigarettes while the film was on, he was also becoming quite drunk and fidgety.  Overall it was an experience, it could have been done a lot better. For example, having the chairs set up before anyone for the cinema arrived even if it means closing the terrace for 10/20 minutes. Potentially having less seating, so it was less crammed. Me and my sister both mentioned we would have paid more just for it to be a little more spacious, this would also mean you have more of a chance to actually see the film. I also believe they should have a no phone policy like normal cinemas. I understand its meant to be quite a laidback experience but it would be better for those who actually wanted to see the film, to not hear facebook notifications every 5 minutes and been featured in others snapchats!", "date_of_review": "21 July 2015"}

Together with a group of friends, amongst which my brother in law who was celebrating his bday, we decided to go to Queen of Hoxton as I had been there before and had fun. We were told to go in the queue if we didn't have reservations and as I was the first one in the queue from our group, I showed my I'D, si did my girl friend behind me, after which we were asked how many of us we were, we said 5 and we were told by the bouncer that it was a private event and because we did not have reservations, we couldn't go in. Funny enough he only decided that after having seen our Romanian IT'S. When we challenged him in the kind of \"pruvate\" party, the second bouncer started becoming aggressive with us and told us that we will not be allowed in because I was being aggressive (by asking them why we can't go in when everyone else in the queue was allowed in, even though none of them had reservations) and that they worry if someone says something to me in the bar, I would start a fight ( I barely weight 52 kg and measure 1.65m). A lady who heard the conversation and who had organised the entertainment programme for the night heard the conversation and said to us it wasn't a private party and the bouncers should let us in, then tried to get us in and the bouncers said they will not let us in. The manager came outside as well and instead of first listening to us, being the customers and the ones humiliated in front of everyone there, he had a good 10 min char with the bouncer and came to tell us the same story that the bouncer started: what if we were going to start a fight in there. He finally listened to our story as well and he apologised but instead of letting us in, he went on the other side of the street with the bouncer to \"investigate\".  I have been to many clubs and bars in London and worldwide, but never before I was not let in because of my nationality. It's a shame that this still happens in London in the 21st century. After having read previous reviews of the place, I'm disgusted to see that there have been other people having incidents with the bouncers there and that the management is doing nothing about it. This shows that they don't care about their reputation nor their customers.

We opted to have our second drink downstairs in the aircon where it was also starting to fill up as there was now a queue to get upstairs. Unfortunately drinks are also served in plastic down here.  Its clearly nailed the setting and this is what attracts the crowds of 20's and 30's and it will continue to pull them in, but, unless we head here for one of the movie nights, we're unlikely to come back", "date_of_review": "20 July 2014"}

Whilst getting a drink at the ground floor bar, i saw this 'DJ' madly twiddling nobs on the mixer channel which was at zero volume. Being a DJ myself i was intrigued, so i watched him for a while. The guy did not even attempt to mix. There was a track running and he literally just played with idle controls whilst dancing about like a moron. I've never seen such a pretentious display of fakery in my life. I've seen some terrible DJ's, but none as bad as this.  I decided to talk to him. A few times i pointed out that he was using controls on a silent channel - no response. I then said he was a crap DJ. When he looked up, i realised it was Matt Horne (the guy from gavin and stacey). I was a little starstruck and stopped what i was doing to go tell my friends. As i pointed him out he was reeling of some trap to the bouncers about how i had assaulted him over the decks. They then grabbed me and took me out. I asked the bouncer why i'd been kicked out, i was told i 'shouldn't have pushed the DJ'. I paid \u00a35 to get into that club and my night was over because Gavin can't accept the fact that he's a poser. The whole situation was hilarious. Seriously matt - stop kidding yourself and stick to the acting & whilst you're at it, don't ruin peoples evenings unnecessarily. Grow up. You're not a princess, and you're certainly not a DJ.", "date_of_review": "22 September 2013"}

Silly idea considering we had never been but we had seen some images and thought it looked worth a go.  The bar was ok. But avoid the cocktail menu as most the ones we tried were super badly done.  Bar staff were nice but the door men are way ott. They wouldn't let us smoke outside on the ground floor. So we had to keep going up insane amounts of staircases to reach the roof terrace, that whilst was cool in ok weather it was pouring with rain plus you couldn't take a drink with you and they had closed the bar up there. Because of this our mate tried to smoke outside downstairs and when she asked the doormen if that was ok and she'd be quick she got kicked out and wasn't even allowed back in to tell us and get her stuff. By the time we realised this, as we thought she was on the roof terrace, she'd gone home!! Total joke!  The basement music was utter rubbish and you could tell this by the lack of people down there. The band was a bad choice. Ground floor music started out ok until a dj came on and continually played the same kinda tunes over and over that you could tell only appealed to the 'spring breakers' in the room. Shame they didn't get the basement going with better tunes.  The crowd is young, and full of bad drunks, pretentious and fixated on trying to be cool but forgetting to have fun.  The toilets are just beyond disgusting with no one looking after them. Literally horrific!!  I'm moaning as most of the QoH is just not my bag, but a little more cleanliness, some common sense from the DJs (check your crowd), another room with alternative music to the main room and lighter touch doormen would dramatically better this place.

The system for the smoking area after the upstairs bar has shut is unworkable - I've had my drinks stolen numerous times because they won't let you go up with a drink.  Bouncers tried to block 2 of my friends re-entering the last time we were there, just because they went out front to make a phone call - they had told one of the bouncers what they were doing. So yes, signal can be poor in there, you have been warned. I'd probably give QoH 2 stars, but I've had some good nights in there merely due to good music/DJ and excellent company.

Unfortunately, the rude and unprofessional staff ruined it for me. At 11.30, we decided to get a few drinks in ready to toast in the new year at midnight, knowing the bar would be busy. However, we waited for half an hour to get served. Now I appreciate how busy it was, but here was no order at the bar to who was being served; time and again we were ignored by the staff who all crammed at one end of the bar, serving others before us who had clearly only been at the bar a matter of minutes. It was completely random who they picked, and I found this very frustrating. However, we got served just at midnight which, although annoyed at the wait, was simply relieved to get a drink for midnight. Yet halfway through our order, she demanded we pay and wouldn't get the rest of the drinks we'd asked for, saying the bar was shut at midnight for 15 minutes. I was incredibly annoyed about this; how unbelievably unprofessional! I understand bar staff should get a drink at midnight - I have worked New Year's Eve in a bar and didn't get a chance to toast at midnight which was disappointing - but to just cut us off half way through and then walk away was incredibly rude. When I tried to get any other members to complain, they just pointed to the sign that the bar was shut and walked away. Eventually I managed to get hold of the manager and tell him that we shouldn't have been cut off half way through - to which he simply shrugged and said 'oh well' before walking off. He clearly did not care at all. So much for 'the customer is always right'. I worked in several bars across 5 years, so above all common sense, to be dismissed and ignored in such a way was unprofessional, rude and disrespectful.

Wouldn't really recommend going there if you're looking for a clubbing/bar night out. Girls - What to wear: My friends and I arrived at the venue at maybe 11pm-ish, and everyone was very casual. Some people still in their work clothes, shirts and skirts, sandals, ballet pumps, others in jeans and tops. Do not bother wearing dresses/skirts/embellished tops or heels to this venue, it's VERY casual. Vans/Converses are definitely appropriate in case anyone is wondering.  Music: If you're into trancy/house music then downstairs is perfect for you. Lots of strobe lights and all that. The music upstairs is a mixture of current, old school r&b, hip hop but for me personally, it wasn't a consistent stream of good music, enough to keep me dancing all night. And I couldn't really hear what songs were playing sometimes, way too crowded.  PROS: 1. The cloakroom is \u00a31 and bags are free. 2. I ordered a single Vodka orange and it was only \u00a34.50 3. There's a photobooth and for \u00a32 you get 4 photos, printed & e-mailed. This was great! There's also a foosball table but the ball was missing and a pinball machine but I think it was broken or something because no one was using it.  4. There's air-conditioning on the 1st floor, this was so handy as its a very crowded venue. 5. On the right hand side of the venue there is quite a few seats and tables, this again was handy as the dancing area was really crowded. CONS: 1. The girls bathroom was absolutely baking and extremely claustrophobic, only 4 toilets and no toilet paper in all but one cubicle.  2. The music was a little disappointing, a weird combination all mixed together that didn't really flow.  3. The rooftop - the picnic tables, the slushie bar and the swings were all cordoned off. We were told by a member of staff that their license only allows them to have those facilities open from 12pm-10pm. So remember, if you're coming for a night out at QOH, you can't use any of those things. Also you need to climb about 6 flights of stairs to get there. Very disappointing but I understand that's not the venue's fault.  Overall, I wouldn't return to Queen of Hoxton, the music wasn't great and the atmosphere wasn't right, but it all depends on your personal taste. The fact that all the quirky things about the rooftop were cordoned off was really disappointing, after seeing the pictures on here we were really looking forward to it. We didn't have a problem with the staff, they weren't overtly nice but they weren't rude either. The crowd was mid to late 20s, some right doucge bag guys there but again that's not the venues fault.
