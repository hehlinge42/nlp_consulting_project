That is!!! Don t go for food because is not worth it. We have waited more than 1 hour to get hamburgers and was 11.30 pm when we got them so we had to rush our dinner as at 12.00 pm they were closing. Drinks are ok but i was expecting more as i ordered a margarita and they served in the wrong glass ( mini martini cup). The classics are classics and cannot be changed!

The food was ok, hit and miss; delicious prawn bun and mini tartlets but dry scones and warm tea.... We booked afternoon tea in advance and arrived on time and seated at a window at the smallest table you\u2019ve ever seen. We were reminded of our two hour slot (no problem with this). We ordered tea and a lager but without any explanation of when our food might arrive I didn\u2019t drink my tea as I was waiting for my food. By the time it arrived my tea was cold and when I mentioned it I was advised I could have a top up. A simple explanation would have sufficed at the time of being seated.  The food was actually quite nice and the amount was more than enough however, you know that tense feeling you get when you\u2019re constantly and unnecessarily looking around for service - well I had that feeling! No one there to replenish our drinks.... Oh, and it was freezing in there.....  I guess the problem is with this place is that it is \u2018style over substance\u2019 with the venue carrying the inattentive service and average food. We should have known better. It\u2019s the place to be if you\u2019re trying to curate your insta-life! Four people sitting close by were so entertaining as they took a million photos of each other in numerous comical poses and then spent an equal amount of time reviewing said photos . That said, it\u2019s testament to to the lovely sky high venue and cool decor that encourages people to want to visit The Nest - fair enough.  We wouldn\u2019t visit again. We enjoyed some of the food and had mixed feelings on the venue. We felt the service was poor. ", "date_of_review": "12 December 2020"}

However, it couldn't have been further from the experience I had, which was faultless. Social distancing in the bar/restaurant itself was in line with the current guidelines, and this made me feel very at ease. The staff were lovely and really helpful. They couldn't sit us out on the terrace straight away, so we had a snack and a drink inside, and they then moved us onto the terrace, once a space was available. All this was done very seamlessly. The view - incredible! Although not the only thing that made this experience really great. The food was excellent as well. Will definitely return and have already recommended the place to some friends. Thanks for a really nice time.", "date_of_review": "7 August 2020"}

We were a group of 11 and really enjoyed the atmosphere, the interaction with the staff and the opportunity to get great views (and pics) of the London landscape. Interesting selection of cocktails - not the usual and a good selection of nibbles. We had booked for our group so advisable to ring in advance as a new venue with quite high security - which was quite comforting although it did take a few minutes to gain access.", "date_of_review": "12 December 2019"}

This was just a quick visit so I thought I would just order a dessert.  Having some experience of various places serving Sticky toffee pudding this was my selected option.  I was informed this is made fresh on-site and on a bright afternoon in the roof terrace this was the perfect surroundings and really looked forward to this prior to my meeting.  It took some time but this is usually a good sign, presentation is nice but afraid this is just too small a portion and I have had many a sticky toffee pudding and disappointed in a number of areas from the portion size through to the taste and was served cold, even the base powder had no real taste and sorry but I dont think you need to try to be clever with a sticky toffee pudding other than do it well and provide a good size portion with a home made ice cream and should be served hot with a special toffee sauce, it should be light and moist but this failed on all counts and was cold and dry.  I will look to attend again and try more dishes but I would urge the chef to reconsider this option and maybe on my next visit I can spend time to try a few options.", "date_of_review": "21 March 2020"}

You enter through the main hotel entrance and are transported to the bar via lifts, upon the doors opening you were greeted by a beautifully designed bar and restaurant area, with house music filling the air. Having arrived as a walk-in, we expected to have to sit at the bar which would have been fine. Within moments of finding bar stools a stewardess approached us and let us know that a table had become free, this level of customer care is superb. We were seated by a floor to ceiling window, with views across the London skyline, it was spectacular and the perfect backdrop for photos.  The cocktails were nothing short of amazing; each one prepared on site on a 360 bar; so you really get amongst the action. So reasonably priced, when you account for the level of service you receive.  We didn\u2019t eat here, but all commented on the inviting smells coming from the kitchens; sadly, we\u2019d eaten elsewhere!  A great place to meet friends, celebrate and chill.", "date_of_review": "4 May 2020"}

We arrived late on Sunday afternoon so we had our pick of seats. The views speak for themselves but the bar itself is stunning.  The decor is homely yet glamorous without the need for gimmicky Instagram photo opportunities.  Service was attentive and whilst the team were clearly adhering to the new social distancing measures, they were happy to have a chat and made us feel very welcome. Our drinks were well made and arrived quickly. We had eaten elsewhere but a glance at the menu made us want to return next time for food. A special mention goes to Mikey who made the booking process seamless. He went above and beyond to accommodate us which gave a perfect first impression. One which was echoed throughout our booking. We had a truly wonderful time at The Nest and will definitely be back.", "date_of_review": "13 July 2020"}

On entering the restaurant, the front of house staff greeted me with 'You only have a 2 hour slot', not particularly welcoming! We sat down and requested some aperitivi, we were told that none were available and that the best they could do was bread basket. The bread arrived along with one set of cutlery and no plates and a meagre ration of butter. The bread was not artisan but of the pre-packed, part-baked, uniform, tasteless variety you would expect in a motorway service station.  Before the main course arrived, the waiter asked 'Would you like clean cutlery'. I was staggered at being asked such a question - given that hygiene standards should be high.  We ordered filet steaks and when they arrived they looked far from appetising. They were accompanied by blanched salad leaves - soggy, undressed and discoloured. The steak was terrible, probably the worst I have ever eaten. The meat appeared to have been cooked on a dirty grill and there was an overwhelming burnt taste. The taste of the meat did not come through at all. They were also under-seasoned. Never in my life I have left meat uneaten on my plate.  It was a poorly ran establishment with no check-backs, no condiments offered and a poor drinks selection.  I would also like to add that the ambiance was far from relaxing. There was a live DJ that played bass heavy dirge.  Upon paying the bill, I informed the member of staff that the meal was unsatisfactory. He was ambivalent and reluctant to take any action, hence having to voice my concerns on here. I shall also be writing to the Head Office.  I do not want other people to be subjected to overpriced 'room service' style food.", "date_of_review": "26 July 2020"}

No social distancing attempted, all very close together tables, definitely not 1 metre apart. Told we would need masks in the lift and in the bar until sat down, but that did not happen, ushered into a lift with others who were not wearing masks, (why?!) no one wearing masks, in the nest, staff had them around their necks half the time, no one to greet you when you walk in, stood there like lemons.  Food looked average, but did not matter as we were ignored for 30 mins when sat down, told we could not have an empty table outside as it would need a clean, how long could that take??!, we walked out in the end. Possibly teething trouble but not worth risking covid for zero attentiveness and v high priced menu with ZERO service. Avoid until something is done to give any attempt at customer service when public confidence is low, standards should be near 100 percent.", "date_of_review": "5 August 2020"}
