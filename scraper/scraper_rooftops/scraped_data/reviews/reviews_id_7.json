With the new COVID rules you have to order online. We ordered two separate orders and one arrived one didn\u2019t. After half an hour of waiting for a drink I went to ask at the bar if they had gotten the order and whether it was coming. The waiter said he would bring it over but after a further half an hour no drink was brought. It wouldn\u2019t be an issue if I hadn\u2019t paid but as I had, I felt like it was within my rights to get the drink. After over an hour we were leaving and i asked if I could get a refund because so much time was wasted and we had to get moving. Multiple bar staff tried to convince me that it would take so much time and hassle to request a refund but in the end it took less than a minute. I think it\u2019s extraordinary and rather insulting that they were so unhelpful in giving money back. Whilst filling out the \u2018refund details\u2019 I was patronised and made to feel like my request was stupid, even though they had taken my money and not delivered and were now not wanting to give my money back. Special shout out to the waitress at the bar who lacked any decorum/decency and ridiculed to our faces that we asked for a refund. I\u2019d be embarrassed to employ staff who clearly are not cut out to be around people and work in hospitality. After reading other reviews it\u2019s pretty clear that this is not the first time someone has asked for a refund and by the sounds of it, not many people actually receive them. I would therefore recommend any other bar in Camden if you want to have a nice experience.", "date_of_review": "16 August 2020"}

This did not happen and instead it came as the pineapple juice. 10 minutes after the food order had been taken and paid, the waitress returned and informed us that the kitchen was closed and no food was available.

GREAT! - Food DISGRACEFUL!", "comment": "Whilst the signage needs to be vastly improved (communication is King), the staff were very welcoming and friendly. The setting and lighting was good with an enjoyable ambience. The menu was fine with good choices for starters, mains and sweets - and at \u00a320 for three courses, had everything been edible, it would all have made for a great night; however, unfortunately, the food wasn't even satisfactory. From the quality of the meal, I hope it's simply down to a lack of qualified catering staff on the night - as there's simple NO EXCUSE, for serving heated frozen vegetables! - They were rank! Anyone in the hospitality industry will confirm, an eatery can best be judged by the excellence, or not, of the vegetables it serves. A lesson to be learned here. The three vegetables served:- tasteless, limp carrots; dry, dodgy tasteless roast(?) potatoes, and solid frankly awfully tasteless Brussel sprouts - and I usually love all three BUT these were the worst vegetables I believe I EVER experienced! Ultimately, if an eatery can't get the basics right, then don't take people's money - as simple as that. Had the entertainment been SO good, I would have refused to pay for at least the main course. Finally, the establishment knew the three guests sat at our table were unknown to each other and just happened to be sharing a table together, I was therefore showed to be presented with the expectation and bill, for me to pay for the whole bill! Sharing a table and an evening does NOT mean I should be expected to pay for two total strangers and felt compelled to do so, to avoid total embarrassment! The Cabaret was REALLY GOOD; the waiting staff; the bar staff; the evening was REALLY GOOD - all spoiled by the quality (or lack of quality) of the food - a main, if not THE main ingredient on offer to its Customers.", "date_of_review": "20 December 2019"}

We weren\u2019t informed we were sharing. The space was very intimate to be sharing with strangers. The show started, there isn\u2019t a stage. They just sort of parade around between the tables. The artistes were great, amazing voices, lots of dancing and showmanship. And our host for the night Miss Polly-Rae had the right level of dirty and sweet. The service for drinks and food is hit and miss, and hectic. They cram a lot of people into a small space and can barely cope with the amount of staff on hand (not sure if they were short staffed or it\u2019s always that way). Once the cocktails arrived they were delicious but took a while. The food was tasty however it was stone cold, and lamb rump cold can be challenging, especially with blunt, cheap knives.

The show was amazing! Me and my friends thoroughly enjoyed! We also pre-booked dinner which was great! We then partied into the early hours in the club after. Big thanks to the team who made my birthday memorable. Would highly recommend booking cabaret!", "date_of_review": "14 February 2019"}

Huge queues were forming and it was cold and wet. Went in a spoke to somebody sensible who did allow us in to spend money in the bar!!!! Acts were an acquired taste with some extremely blue material which was not to my taste. Many left after first two acts. Would not visit again as there are other comedy clubs to visit.", "date_of_review": "13 February 2019"}
