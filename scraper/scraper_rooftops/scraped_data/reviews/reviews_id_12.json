He explained to the waiter because he knows that kind of request sometimes annoys the kitchen. The waiter came back and told us that the chef suggested to cook it medium and if I can\u2019t really eat it we can return it to the kitchen. My husband explained that he like his meat medium rare and me medium well. We asked him to check with the chef if they can cut a portion of the meat and cook it medium well and the rest medium rare. When the waiter came back he told us that the kitchen said they cannot do it. It\u2019s clear the kitchen doesn\u2019t want to do it. Disappointed we just decided to order other things just to finish the dinner because we already lose the appetite. I wanted to understand if our request is impossible to execute so I asked my husband since he also work in the kitchen. What he usually does when they received a similar request.

The server couldn't answer simple questions about the menu items; we waited too long for our order to be taken, and then our empty plates were left on the table when we had finished, rather than being cleared promptly. First world problems, I know.  The tempura, sushi, and desserts were very good but we ordered a steak dish that was very fatty and tough, and the \"dips\"(?!) it was served with were not fresh.

Due to Covid19, the treat was delayed until 26th September. At the time of booking, I was asked to give my credit card details so that \u00a340 could be taken in case of a 'no show'. I was reassured that no money would be taken out of my account unless of course the amount on the gift card did not cover the cost of the meal and drinks.  On arriving at the restaurant, we were told that we had to vacate our table by 2.30pm. So we had an hour and 30 minutes maximum to have lunch and cocktails, not my idea of a leisurely relaxing meal. At the end, we asked for the bill and were surprised to find that we had not spent all the money on the gift card. We were ushered promptly out of the dining room as other people wanted our table and it was at this point we looked at the bill. There we found that \u00a340 from my credit card had been added to the bill as had a discretionary service charge of 13.5%. This meant we still had money on the gift card. I asked to see the manager to ask why this had occurred and was told we would have to contact their booking office as they could not help us. Accordingly we did this only to find, we now had to send an email with our problem so that they could sort this out. Whether we will actually get a refund or not, far from feeling relaxed having enjoyed a lovely meal, I feel stressed and wired.  Sushi Samba, you need to sort out your admin and quickly. Additionally, stop trying to cram in diners. The food is not cheap and if I wanted to stuff my face quickly, I could have gone to a McDonalds!", "date_of_review": "26 September 2020"}

Before we arrived, we were warned about a reduced menu which they'd sent to us via email - it still all looked wonderful and there was enough to choose from. Upon arrival, we were told there was no hot food that evening; this cut the already limited menu in half and meant there were 0 meat options!  The second annoyance came when we tried to order a bottle of wine, only to be told they didnt have that either, and the only option they had was \u00a38 more expensive, and they couldnt (or wouldn't) honour the price!  Thirdly, we booked to eat on the terrace, however we found our table to be in a bit of a corridor with absolutely 0 views and people walking past every 30 seconds which is hardly relaxing.  Fourthly there was a hair in the wasabi. This was found right at the end of the meal which made us feel really uncomfortable.  Finally, whilst we were enjoying the food, there was a cleaner mopping the floor around and under the table, so close that it brushed my friends foot. We laughed it off and put it down to the restaurant taking precautions to be covid safe which we fully appreciated, until we were trying to leave, the maitre d\u2019 tried to shove us in a lift with 5 strangers! The lift would have been tight for 9 on a normal night, let alone during a pandemic when everyone is trying to keep their distance. Frankly, it made the mopping feel like a bit of a contradiction.

While dealing with the situation discreetly, he then found it necessary to start talking louder and making it apparent to every other guest in the vicinity that there was a dispute taking place, (causing heads to turn) I am not wealthy and to some this would have been a minor inconvenience but it was the principal of asking for 1 thing and being sold another. I have never been so embarrassed and some what mortified at a situation that could have been handled so differently from such a prestigious venue that I was so looking forward to spending my evening in.  I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy", "date_of_review": "15 March 2020"}

It is the favorite hangout place for sushi lovers lovers. As you step your foot into the restaurant, you are welcomed by the magnificent art deco setting, a beautiful combination of minimalist features and an immense luxury of modernity. Every table gives you a clear view of the chef working in the kitchen. Those, with no prior reservation, are welcomed to wait into the front restaurant with comfortable armchairs. The lounge has wall to ceiling windows and a beautiful terrace.  The menu offers a wide variety of delicious and mouth-watering starters followed by the main course, specially designed for youngsters and adults. I had salmon rolls and tuna rolls. We completed the meal with a fabulous desert and had so many of the brilliant lychee cocktails.  All the cuisines were fresh and refreshing. The award winning chefs gave a home-made feeling using the best quality ingredients. The restaurant also offers various types of drinks, they serve one of the best wines in the region. The drinks are pricey but as previously mentioned surely worth trying. In contrast, the service was of very high quality even though it was very busy. We were attended to at our every need.

Prior to booking, I emailed the restaurant to tell them all six of us would want to have a tasting menu, but one diner is Vegetarian and one diner Coeliac (gluten-free). I wanted to know if this would be an issue, as if it wasn't possible I wouldn't have booked. I was told that would be no problem, and substitutions would be made to the tasting menu to accommodate the dietary requirements. I then called on the day of booking so double confirm this wasn't an issue, as I wanted the focus of the evening to be the birthday. Again, I was told no problem at all.  Upon arrival, I realised I had completely wasted my time and effort with Sushi Samba. The manager informed me they in fact couldn't make substitutions for dietary requirements on the tasting menu, which resulted in the vegetarian and coeliac diners being only able to eat around half of the tasting menu. An appalling lack of communication for a restaurant of this calibre. To add to this, the wait staff are completely inadequate in knowing the menu and dealing with any dietary requirement. They would put down a dish and say 'the gluten-free substitution is on its way' for it to never arrive. Completely unacceptable and misleading. The food was delicious, however the evening ended up being dominated by making our diners feel excluded and unable to dine properly with the rest of the group.  To be clear, if ordering A la carte, they do cater for coeliac and vegetarians, however I was appalled they lied about being able to provide a tasting menu experience simply to get a booking in.

It was nice to be pleasantly surprised! I ordered the tempura shrimp, which was a nice sized portion and had a great refreshing taste in the light dressing with a pea shoot salad. I also ordered the Wagyu gyoza, which were delicious! Like nothing I\u2019ve ever tasted before. The California maki was tasty and fresh. The reason I felt so compelled to write a review however, is to comment on the service we received. We were served by a wonderful Hungarian man, called Florian? forgive the spelling. He was attentive, polite and friendly, and deserves a special mention and thanks for his service. Our group also had several other interactions with staff this evening, all of whom were polite. What I will say, is that even though we never experienced poor, abrupt or rude service, I could imagine how a venue of this nature, at peak times e.g weekends and holidays, could become intense and put pressure on staff. I also got the impression that management may not treat staff in a very nice way. I never witnessed anything but I had sensed the venue tries to uphold a \u201cserious\u201d waiting service, not a relaxed one, which is a shame, as the clientele reflect the opposite...a real lovely diverse mix of bubbly people, representing London and it\u2019s openness. I\u2019ve given a 4 star, as the food was great but not exceptional, the atmosphere could be lightened further (top-down) and the toilets need a massive redesign. I would definitely return to this venue but would continue to avoid busy times and weekends, in fear of experiencing some of the negative aspects mentioned in other people\u2019s reviews.", "date_of_review": "27 February 2020"}

It was packed. And the emailed reservation did say we had 1 1/2 hours. No one gave us a hard time about it, and we did overstay by only 5 minutes. Fun popular venue. It is of course a restaurant....but really more of a venue IMHO. We have been to SSs in Vegas and Miami. The lunch set was OK. My hubby's lobster special was memorable. I thought the lunch cost worth it. It is a destination restaurant more so than the 2 SSs we have been to. The quality of the food was good.

Masses of staff but mostly bored looking and surly. It feels like they don't want to be here, other than to chat to their colleagues.  After being told rather abruptly to leave our table, for the next sitting, and the bill being slapped down, when we came to pay, on rounding our 13.5% optional service down slightly, the bill was charged back up, at the card machine. It was a very small amount but when I queried the increase on my instruction, the same waiter said to us \"come on, you're rich\" Really bad manners.  After paying their prices for a one- off special occasion you expect more. I won't be back. P. S No one will help you find the toilets.

I asked for reassurance all the other payments wouldn\u2019t have gone through, I was reassured this wouldn\u2019t be the case, only 1 payment was taken. He didn\u2019t even apologise for me waiting such a long time for just 1 drink and all the messing around to take payment.  I decided to check the next morning for peace of mind and I WAS charged several times.  So I reported this straight away, I called, I emailed with screen shots of my banks entries which we\u2019re time stamped and I have already had to chase this complaint up 3 times. I spoke with a member of staff as they are struggling to reconcile their accounts. I provided extra details of my bank card digits and have still heard nothing else back. I have emailed again today, This is awful customer service and to think this is an error on their side I\u2019m appalled I have to keep chasing to get my money back.

It is not like they made an effort to serve the food faster so we could have time for a dessert. They were just after money, the sooner they get you out the sooner they can get someone else in.

First of all we were late due to disruption on the tube which we completely understand was our fault. When we reached Liverpool St Station we rang to say we where going to be slightly late to which we we\u2019re told not to worry and everything would be fine. After arriving and being greeted the host at the restaurant we we\u2019re told our table had been given away as we where over 15 minutes late (we where in fact 18 minutes late and rang in advance to warn the host). We we\u2019re told to wait at the bar and they would come and find us if a table came up. 30 minutes went by and we where still sat waiting having not been reassured or even seen by any member of staff despite continuously looking over to grab the hosts attention. I went to double check with the host and he replied the table is just getting cleaned. Another 10 minutes went past before the waiter came to take us to our table.  We we\u2019re put on a tiny table in the corner of the restaurant, one side of the table required myself to manoeuvre around a waiter and the ordering computer. Again, we tried to remain positive our waitress was obviously quite busy and once she had given us our menus 15 minutes had passed without us ordering, I proceeded to grab one of the other waiters to order. Me and my partner ordered different food, I order a main meal (which I was told that the cooking time was 30 minutes) and my partner ordered a couple of small plates. About 3 minutes later my partners food came out. We found this odd given I had just been told my food has a 30 minute cooking time. Obviously my partner didn\u2019t want to sit there and eat whilst I was waiting for my food so we called over the waiter to ask if it could be taken back to the kitchen until my meal was ready - to which he replied I\u2019m not sure if I can do that, let me just check. When he came back he outlined that there was three kitchens and food came out as and when it was ready. This was something that was never outlined to us. His supervisor came over (she was helpful) and said they wouldn\u2019t take my partners food back but she would get the kitchen to prioritise my meal. Miraculously 5 minutes later my food (which has a 30 minute cooking time) was all of a sudden ready... excellent news! - (and the food was very tasty!) However by this time my partners food was almost cold. Thought out the meal we felt overcrowded by at least four to five waiters/waitresses crowding round the order computer. In fact at one point it sounded like they where having a staff meeting. This became overwhelming and we felt like we we\u2019re part of the operation.  This experience has been one to forget and I would not return to Sushi Samba given our terrible ordeal. The service we received did not reflect the \u00a3150 bill and \u00a3100 in drinks at the bar. We understand what we where slightly late, to which we went out of our way to pre-warned the host and didn\u2019t argue about the table being given away. However we we\u2019re left feeling second class by the staff (especially the host on the door). Although my partner received a macaroon (which was very nice of the restaurant) as it was her birthday the whole experience ruined her birthday meal out.", "date_of_review": "27 October 2019"}

Our table was so close to our neighbours that our waiter could not take our order or bring anything to our table in a normal fashion, the only way he could give us anything was over my right shoulder. In addition it felt like we were out with the couple next to us, we really did not want to be. They were so close it was impossible not to overhear their conversation, the man had made a \u2018mistake\u2019 and spent the whole night justifying and grovelling for a second chance. Sushi Samba cannot be held responsible for the content of our neighbours conversation but they can be for the ridiculous proximity of the tables. In a restaurant whereby you can rack up a \u00a3300 bill without trying too hard I expect space to enjoy my evening.  Now for the positives. The food was very good, we had a fantastic shrimp small plate starter, super tasty rolls and a large plate seafood dish, all lovely. Our waiter was excellent, very attentive and he helped us to make some good food choices even if it was over my right shoulder. The Restaurant Manager checked in on us a couple of times, perhaps aware we had not the greatest table. The nicest touch was they added a Happy Birthday d\u00e9cor to the Wife\u2019s dessert without being asked, I thank them for that. The venue and the views over London are cool, all in all it\u2019s a good restaurant but at the price I expect a better table experience.", "date_of_review": "31 October 2019"}

We were there on a sunday night, it was cold inside, and the main room was badly design and very simple from what you exepect from a sushisamba.  The quality of the food itself was very good, but the sushi rolls were just so boring and did not taste as anything specia, actually they felt as normal rolls you could easely order from any fast food sushi place.  When we asked the waiter what we could order instead of the rolls, he looked at us as we were stupid and told us,\" the rolls that you ordered are specials, so nothing else\". We asked him in another way because we thougt that he did not quite understand the point, so we cordially asked him for something that we did not order, that was a speciality for the restaurant. He once again in a very rude way told us, the rolls that you have ordered are the specialities, so nothing else.\" The price it's right for the position of the restaurant, but the staff, it makes everything so bad and negative.

Well, the food was good, nothing to tell our grandchildren about it but ok if you expect the flavour and seasoning to remind you of the food's roots. For starters, we ordered prawn tempura and some sushi rolls - the prawn was nice but no different than in other places and the sushi was really nothing special. For main, we ordered the Churrasco Rio Grande and the Sea Bass Tempura. I have to say that the flavour of the meat was nice since there was no sauce but it was everything well seasoned. There is no sides apart from a tiny bowl of spinach, which is a bit sad since you're paying 50\u00a3 only for this course. The Sea Bass was nice and had a nice presentation, the sauce came in a capsule and really gave a good balance to the fish. The expectation for the views were very high since it is at the top of the building but it was a bit disappointing, the only good view was from the entrance by the stairs. For views, we definitely recommend sky garden instead. Overall, high priced average food with a disappointing view. ", "date_of_review": "19 October 2019"}

The place was fully booked a month in advance and I only managed to book a very late dinner (10pm). I thought it must be a very special place since it's that popular. How wrong I was. 1. The service. On the scale from 1 to 10, I would say 5. Everyone seemed to be uninterested, unengaged, not especially friendly. Our waiter was trying, but he did not seem to be professional (stayed waaaay too close to me when taking the order, did not know the menu well, could not recommend when I asked a very specific question). 2. Atmosphere. Being to Nobu, Zuma, Akira Back and other similar places, I probably had my expectations set too high for Sushisamba. It was not special, it was not interesting, it was not anything that would make me come back.  3. Food. Just no. The quality and the taste of the rolls were like a supermarket ready-made ones. So disappointing. I did not finish ordered food, as it was simply not tasty. 4. Cocktails. To put it simply - I was served the worst Aperol Spritz in Sushisamba I have ever had.

The food was extremely average, often very basic sushi rolls that are no more interesting or flavoursome than a standard box from Itsu. The items we first ordered on the menu were sold out, and the substitute white wine we were brought was served to us lukewarm. Our table also spoiled the experience somewhat, being sat immediately next to the waiter's kiosk. We felt very overlooked, with staff constantly hovering brushed up against the table and in earshot of our conversation. Service was rushed, there was a feeling of trying to move people on as quickly as possible. The staff still managed to lose our wine bottle half way through the meal despite this, meaning that we had to wait 15 minutes while they tried to look for it. The decoration inside the restaurant is plain and nothing special, although the setting at the top of Heron Tower does make for wonderful scenic views. This was perhaps the one element of the restaurant that does feel exclusive - in all other respects Sushi Samba commands a high price tag that it does not really earn.

To start with, the access via an express panoramic elevator up to the 39th floor provides quite some views of the City and beyond. Up there, you find quite an eclectic and busy place with endless stunning views over the rooftops of the City of London. The Japanese-Peruvian fusion food at the inside dining area is good and tasty although somehow pricey. But I believe, the setup and rental of the place must not come cheap either... Great staff as well although the bar was quite too busy for the just 2 barmen attending it that inevitably led to almost a 15 minutes waiting queue to order a few drinks after lunch.

I had booked a table at sushi samba city on June 26 for a dinner for a group of 6 on the 20th of August 2019, so I was expecting to receive a nice table. Little did I know that my bad experience would start even before setting foot in the restaurant.  We were a group of 3 adults and 2 children aged 13 and 10. We arrived downstairs to be greeted by security at 8:52 pm, 8 minutes ahead of my reservation at 9:00 pm. The security guard/gate keeper advised us that we will need to wait at the door of the lifts for 8 minutes since the children are not allowed to wait upstairs near the bar area until we are seated. We reluctantly agreed and were kept waiting at the ground floor in the very tight space next to the lifts for 8 minutes as in lookers kept asking us why we were not boarding the lifts. We were then told by the same security guard to step aside next to the wall to allow other people enough space to board the elevators. We were spoken to in a rude manner. It was at this point I started regretting booking again at the restaurant. We waited a full 8 minutes and were then allowed to board the lift. When we finally got up and got seated at our table we were told that the children can visit the viewing terrace, only to be told later that it was not allowed. The service was exceptionally slow, the gyoza came cold and my wife\u2019s drink was removed without asking her if she was done with it or not.  I will never ever recommend this restaurant to anyone, the food is nothing to brag about and the service was simply unacceptable. I regret coming again to sushi samba city. There are numerous similarly priced restaurants in London where you feel like an appreciated customer.  Shame on you sushi samba, you lost a loyal customer. ", "date_of_review": "20 August 2019"}

Location, fun, views good although not from our table - even though we had booked one of the large booths to get a view ours was over some structure outside with no city view. 39th floor was closed for some reason so when we arrived about 20 minutes early we were invited to have a drink at the bar, which is not as enticing as it sounds as its a small unappealing bar tucked in the corner or to go outside Lovely you might think but had limited furniture and many smokers. Luckily someone else came over to us and asked us if we wanted to use the terrace off the main restaurant. Game changer - this was awesome with panoramic views and lovely comfy sofas. I struggle to understand why this wasn't offered in the first place though. We were a party of 7 celebrating a 21st birthday - so wasn't a great start. The food is pretty good, if you know what to order. My daughter ordered seasonal vegetables which arrived looking like an ash tray with minuscule pieces of beetroot, onion embedded in the ash - which I believe was edible - very odd - very much style over substance. Sashimi really good and presented in a very elaborate way. Food was good just not really great - I should be raving about it but I'm not. Atmosphere - well we had a good time but none really to think of - I think that this is probably more lively, atmospheric at night time. I guess the good thing about that was we were not rushed off our table which happens so much in London. Very expensive but we expected that. Service very pleasant. Nothing really wrong - apart from the poor welcome - but at these prices, with that location etc it should knock my socks off and it didn't.", "date_of_review": "3 September 2019"}

Feels a bit weird ordering McDonald's after you've spent \u00a3200 on dinner, but anyone who's been to SushiSamba will understand why. Apart from the recent ending to Game of Thrones, I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in my life. Food was bog average. If you are one of the many standard British people who think Wagamama is somehow decent, then you would probably find SushiSamba \"immersive\" or \"superb\", or whatever fits on your Instagram caption. The simple fact is that the food at SushSamba is bog average Japanese, presented in a manner to look like it was prepared by a Michelin Star chef. Then there is the food portions, they are so ridiculously small you would have to spend \u00a31000 to be full. After we ordered our waiter told us \"oh no no that is enough food\", but what he forgot to add was \"if you have already eaten dinner\". Perhaps he said it under his breath, so technically he wasn't lying. Well played waiter, well played. Now I know what you are thinking, \"It's not about the food, its about the whole experience!\". True, the elevator ride was awesome, and drinking at the bar was fun...but that's it. Our table was jammed in the corner, with two seating options: Option A: Sun glaring straight into your eyes with no possible escape Option B: Sitting right behind the waiters kiosk and dealing with the constant threat of their behind parts hitting you in the back of the head. We asked to move tables but we were met with a vague shrug of the shoulders that there were no other tables. Me and my partner switched seats a couple of times just to mix things up a bit (exciting I know), but the crushing feeling of disappointment was always there. I will say though, the manager came over and apologized once we paid the bill, and gave us a free glass of champagne each. As much as I wanted to make a \"say goodnight to the bad guy\" Tony Montana style exit, it was a nice gesture so we left without making a scene. So in summary, maybe you will have a better experience if you get the right table, but ultimately you are paying an obscene amount of money for an Instagram Post. I highly recommend eating before you go or you will likely end up at McDonald's by the end of the night...just like we did.", "date_of_review": "9 August 2019"}

The space has several outdoor areas, but even when seated inside the restaurant you get stunning views of London and the surrounding area. The food is wildly diverse, fusing - as its name suggests - Japanese and South American flavors. We hit on a lot of VERY tasty items. The Edamame is the low-key best thing on the whole menu. It comes out steaming hot with a perfect black salt sprinkled on it. Also, the Shrimp Tempura is delicious and the Wagyu Gyoza (you get five per order) are a must. We came back for more of these later in our meal. There are lots of sushi roll creations and here's what we liked best: the Samba London is very nice, but the one you should not miss is the Neo Tokyo. It combines the punch of spicy tuna, crunch of tempura, and finishes it all off with an awesome dollop of aji panca (smoky peppery Peruvian BBQ sauce).  What keeps me from giving SushiSamba five stars? The rotating cast of managers often \"interrupt\" the servers, disrupting their flow and rapport with your table. Also, we ordered several pieces of sushi nigiri that never came. And that may have been a blessing because for all the very good things SushiSamba offers, I don't think it's a sushi restaurant with sushi chefs preparing the finest crafted pieces of fish.  Overall, a very good, fun experience and definitely worth it for a special occasion.", "date_of_review": "24 July 2019"}

Staff is very polite and ready to help. Prices, well, not very cheap, but the money you pay is definitely worth the quality you get.  Just a small clue - if you want to get there, reservation is more than highly recommended (you can't enter while just \"passing by\"). So, you could feel a little bit of \"official\" atmosphere. Also, you do not have one waiter, who serves your table - there are many of them.

The bar was busy but nothing more than you'd expect for a Saturday. Security were having an argument with another group on arrival so wasn't the best first impression. The barman was also miserable and disinterested. The front of house staff, especially the maitre d', were abysmal, rude and also disinterested.  We were sat down roughly on time and the waiter we had was the best thing about the place; very attentive and friendly. A shame his management don't follow his example. He put together a varied menu for us. The food was decent, nothing more.  Once we'd stopped ordering any more alcohol or food, and were enjoying coffee, we were asked to vacate the table. The front of house staff very abrupt and abrasive with this request, which was embarrassing for them and us.  Finally, the toilets were in a disgusting state. When the maitre d' was informed of that, she half heartedly apologised with a smirk on her face. Again, completely disinterested. We paid \u00a3150 per head for the meal. For this sort of money, you'd expect impeccable food and service to match. It wasn't. The food was mediocre and the service disgraceful (except our waiter). The overriding sense given by the staff was one of arrogance, probably driven by how busy and booked upthey get. They don't need to worry about repeat business - yet. However, once this place goes out of fashion (and it will very quickly judging by the other reviews), it will fade away like many others. A shame, as could be so much better if managed properly.  Am expecting the stock response from management of \"we're known for impeccable and attentive service\" or such like. Looking at the reviews, they really are not.", "date_of_review": "13 May 2019"}

I have never eaten sushi prepared in that way, and I'm a fan. We ordered a mixture of small plates, sashimi and sushi rolls and we ate as much as we wanted. The meal was reasonable, probably because two of us ordered a glass of wine and then stuck to water. It's easily affordable if you don't go crazy on the booze, just the same as another relatively fancy restaurant in London. The service was the only reason I did not give five stars. The waiters seemed sometimes confused about what food was meant for our table, and there didn't seem to be more than one waiter that was taking orders. It always took a while to catch anyone's attention, and the service was pretty rushed and not the warmest. However there were a few waitresses that gave us genuinely warm smiles and our plates were cleared between each course efficiently.  The view is brilliant, but I'm not too sure how one gets a window table with a view...maybe you have to be lucky?  I would really recommend this restaurant and I will be back.

Sushisamba however managed to surprise me by how poor it was despite this. There are always better and worse tables in restaurants, then some restaurants have tables that simply should not be a table they would allocate to a paying guest. Here however they are quite happy to sit you at a table with no view right by the clearing station / order desk. Upon being taken to this table we simply asked to sit elsewhere as I don't think anyone should be subjected to that table especially at these prices. They to be fair after 10 minutes did indeed move us, this was however only after making it clear we would simply leave and eat elsewhere that stay at the table. The table moved to was far better, not amazing, but it certainly very nice and we were happy with it. Bottle of champagne ordered, warm bottle of champagne served. When I pointed this out upon tasting I received a reaction of I had no idea what I was talking about, I suggested they try it themselves, sure enough it was accepted the champagne was not chilled properly and rather than offer to replace it they got a large bucket of ice and offered to chill it while we finished the drinks we had ordered at the start. The food was nice, certainly nothing that's going to win any awards or make you think wow. What did make you think wow was the speed of service. Despite the issue with the table and the champagne problems they managed to serve us the entire order in under 1 hour of stepping out of the lift. To be clear we ordered various items and the first of which turned up within 1 minute of the waiter leaving the table. We did complain and to be fair they apologised and adjusted the bill with an offer that we should contact them before returning so they can show how it should be. Normally I am open to giving somewhere another chance but on this occasion I didn't get the sense there was any point. The place is designed to extract as much cash from you in the shortest amount of time with little regard for service and average food.

The Place We booked three weeks in advance since it\u2019s known to always be fully booked. Situated in a lovely tower, from the moment you step into the elevator, you start to see all on the city from above where you can explore the magical view. The place is beautifully decorated, bustling with music and people. They have the main dining area and the bar area. Their outside bar has a beautiful tree which lights up in the evening.  The Food We ordered a variety of sushi and Negri. The food was great and each Maki roll was incredible. A burst of different flavours and ingredients told each story. My absolute favourite dish was the Kobe slider. A cheaper, smaller bite of the Japanese style beef but with equal decadent flavour. It was a was melt in the mouth and full of flavour. We concluded our experience with the famous banana cake. The Verdict Nothing I say will dent the popularity of Sushisamba. I was always prepared for the appeal and value of Sushisamba to be limited to the view and decor, but I was still taken aback by just how expensive the \u00a370 Shoji menu was. There are some amazing dishes in there, but at this price, you can do so much better in London.  Would definitely recommend this place for a fine dining experience.

Once we had been patted down we got up the lift and were able to drop our work bags in a cloak room which was great. The views were fantastic, so approaching the bar I knew I was in for a bit of a hefty bill. Now, I appreciate I am in London, and you are paying for the view, it \u00a347 for 3 G&Ts made my eyes water. I could have bought 2 bottles of the gin for that. I was even more surprised when reflecting on my receipts from the night out showed they had added a 13.5% service charge on to my bill! Now, call me old fashioned, but what service? I stood by the bar, waited for the difficult task of pouring 3 gins into a jigger and opening 3 bottles of tonic, then carried my guns back to our table. And that deserves a \u00a35.47 charge! Needless to say I will definitely be getting those removed if I ever go here again, but I can\u2019t argue the view was fantastic.", "date_of_review": "5 April 2019"}

Despite the good selection of Japanese whiskey, beer etc was no really value for the money. The service needs to be improved as we had the card to pay the bill on the table and the waiter just came and took it without asking if he may be allowed for it. It look a little bit strange and the service was really rushed. Overall, average, you pay the name and not the quality of the service.

Soooo, me and friends randomly pop at the entrance on a Friday afternoon and we were thinking just get to the bar and have a pulse of the place but probably they wouldn't let us without booking. Funny enough, we just pass through the people that were queuing for the restaurant and we went straight in because we were going to the bar. Lift up, speedy one! 39th...floor maybe, got confused as there's communicating spiral stairs between these floors above. Anyway at the bar, strange arrangement in a central station were the bartenders actually walk around and serve costumers either standing or in the very few seating places. The place is way too small for the number of people but ok, our drinks took 25 min to be prepared... meanwhile we've asked to take a seat on one of the available booths which was reserved but for later so we got to seat as probably they don't like empty spaces. After the drinks delay, excuses etc, we got our cocktails and compensation champagne and water... nice!  Chilling, chatting just have a good time, we asked if it would be possible to eat something and surprise! They said they could arrange for a place in the restaurant below, oooookey! Decided to give a go to this fusion gastronomy.  Did I mention the prices of the drinks? Be ready to be shocked! Restaurant, easy peasy, again too small for the number of people hence some extra room in the place above that serve the food from the restaurant... and the outdoor space in the restaurant level only in warm days, good luck with that! We seat at the round counter where the chefs were preparing, we've got tempura shrimps, samba rolls sushi, poussin teriyaki (chicken) which probably not the best examples of the fusion food but there was somehow a twist here and there that speaks both cultures I guess. I did mention the drinks cost, so the meal wasn't a surprise when three digits bill arrived!!! All good, fun experience and everybody had a good time, the views are quite striking and it's obviously a very glamourous place to be and to be seen I guess.", "date_of_review": "7 April 2019"}

I eventually managed to get a Friday evening table for my birthday (but you have to book quite far in advance for a prime time). I\u2019d read some mixed reviews and was actually a bit cautious thinking perhaps we\u2019d be paying more for the environment than we would be for the quality of the food. However, I was wrong. We turned up about ten minutes before our booking and were seated straight away in a window seat which was beautiful. The staff were lovely (unlike some of the reviews on here suggest). The food was delicious, perhaps not the best we\u2019ve had but definitely up there. What made it more delicious we\u2019re the interesting combinations of flavours. I would definitely recommend the yellowtail taquitos, the Neo Tokyo rolls, green bean tempura and wagyu gyozas. We also used the cloakroom to check in a small cabin suitcase. After reading some really terrible reviews I was a bit concerned about this but it was absolutely fine. My only complaints would be that we each ordered a cocktail when we were first seated and it took about 15/20 minutes for them to come, arriving after our first couple of dishes. This meant we weren\u2019t able to order the wine we were looking forward to with our mains. Also, we asked the waiter to take the service charge off the bill and we would pay that with cash. He didn\u2019t and instead took two service charges and unfortunately we only noticed after we\u2019d left so couldn\u2019t do anything about it.

The view is amazing, perfect place to enjoy yourself even if you go only for a drink at the bar. The overall experience was positive for our first time. The food was really good but not perfect and some of the dishes were way overpriced. I guess you have to pay some extra cash for the view as well. The staff was absolutely fantastic I have to admit, apart from two situations. First, when you arrive in a place like this you expect at least to be welcomed with a smile. Maybe on that day the dark short haired lady who was the hostess had a bad morning because her mood was like you owed her some money or something like that. Second, when the bill arrived I told the waiter that I didn't want to pay the suggested (13.50%!) service charge in the bill and before I finish my sentence he had an angry look in his face without saying anything. I said to him that I prefer to pay the tip in cash. That would be 10% of the final bill.

As reputation suggests I am unsurprised to see a number of 6ft odd bouncers stood behind a red rope and a row of eager looking diners. As we took our places behind other smartly dressed couples I couldn\u2019t help but notice a group of very confident looking 18 year olds waltz up to the bouncers, ignoring the queue, clearly assuming that with their tiny skirts, overly blow dried hair and try hard look, they would be whisked to the front of the queue. It was pleasing then, when the bouncer took one look and signalled that they return to the back, no favours were being done. The couple in front were ID\u2019d, they did not have a reservation and put to one side. As I scrambled for mine we reached the front, on announcing that I had reservation, I was promptly let in no questions asked and guided to a lift. We felt somewhat like rockstars, so lesson learnt, reservation is key !  On entering into the lift your expectations are further set alight, as a fast-moving lift as it whizzes up 39 floors, whisking you away from the hustle and bustle of Liverpool Street.  Upon leaving the lift you make your way through a decorative bamboo arch way and are greeted by a host who whisks away your coat and hands you a number card, with a strict instruction NOT to lose it. Noted! The bar area upstairs is shut for a private event, but its the first hint to SushiSamba's famous indoor trees, with a gorgeous cherry blossom tree overhanging the bar. We make our way down the stair case and into a buzzy bar at this point the seated restaurant still remains tantalisingly around the corner, hidden from view. Crowds of young instagrammers huddle in corners urgently taking as many selfies and pictures of them drinking cocktails as possible, interspersed with city workers, well dressed and vibrant and couples. We find our way to yet another reception desk and are greeted by some rather stone faced hosts, who ooze cool and make you feel rather un glamorous no matter what you are wearing ! However, once again it seems that this is done to put off the punters, those who have not planned ahead and booked ! And once we\u2019d given our name to the hostess and been granted entry we were whisked away by a grinning host who had an animated discussion about what our experience would entail. As we rounded the curved corner detailing the famous graffiti style art work we suddenly entered into the main restaurant. An immense room with 360 degree panoramic windows, lit by what seemed like an eternity of dangling globe pendant lights, made it seem almost as if we were walking into the Great Hall at Hogwarts with its magical ceiling. Above this stunning canopy stands a bamboo look frame which curves downwards to join the floor.  At first as were seated, I couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed, yes we were put near the window but in the furthest most corner of the restaurant, crammed in behind the Host service station, meaning we couldn\u2019t get out of our table without asking the congregating waiters to move, my husbands view was alright, although to the side just of crane. But for me just a stack of napkins, the till and the backs of waiters. But due to how busy the restaurant was and because my husband hates it, I agreed not to say anything ! It now came to the painstaking process of narrowing down our food choices to a \u2018reasonable amount\u2019 for two people. A process that I was so overwhelmed by I had to order a cocktail before I could consider it. The menu comprises of a selection of small dishes and larger platters from decadent sushi rolls to succulent sashimi. Our cocktails arrived, I had ordered the Tom Yam off the \u2018Culinary Cocktail List\u2019 the description said that my drink would have an accompanying Turbot Nigiri, I assumed on the side, but oh no - it was on top of my drink.. yes there was Sushi IN MY COCKTAIL. I must say I was a little unsure about this and picked it off and ate it, it was a delicious hint of what was to come. The cocktail its self was a punchy coriander, ginger, lime leaf and chilli infusion. Served long and spiked with Reyka vodka.  Once I had finely plucked up the courage to wade through the menu we made our choice, skipping the large plates we decided to share more small dishes. It is hard to ignore some the eye watering prices on the menu. For example the Kobe Beef Ishiyaki, 1kg of beef served on a hot stone with dipping sauces and pickled plums at \u00a31000, and yes that is correct I did not slip on the key board ! Or the Kobe Churrasco, which is a ribeye steak, chorizo & fillet. I am a foodie but I really am not sure if this price would be worth it and is frankly showy ! So what did we go for; well we started with the crispy taquitos stuffed with lobster and avocado and drizzled with lime which were refreshing, cleansing and a divine mixture of textures and flavours. Soft lobster and smooth avocado mingled with saji amarillo, jalapeno, lime, maize, morado\u00a0and the crisp bite of the outer shell (Yeh, no I don\u2019t know what those ingredients are either - but boy they work). We then tried Tuna ceviche, which looked fantastic, but in reality was our least favourite, the slightly poncey foam adding nothing to the dish and the pomegranate leche de tigre too sharp and completely overpowered the tuna, the maiz morado pleasant but boring, wasabi peas completely lost and the basil\u2026 didn\u2019t know it was there.  But this was a minor blip and the rest of the food was heavenly.  We ate our way through the plethora of dishes with as much glee as children in a sweet shop. Each of the dishes seemed to complement one another even though they were all very different. The Salmon Sashimi so creamy it melted on my tongue, and every other dish that appeared on my tastebuds at first perplexed and then delighted, the depths of flavours truly sensational. The Neo Tokyo Samba Roll though deserves its own mention, my husband had to check several time that I was okay and was still alive. The spicy tuna, tempura crunch, lotus root, aji panca, spicy mayo marinated into flavour explosion, a harmony and truly perfect balance of flavours - is that Umami ? I couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed as we reached our last dish. Just as we were discussing ordering one more, although I was ignoring the fact that I definitely was feeling quite full, our exuberant host shot over with a complimentary plate of Wagyu Gyoza with a kabocha puree and a sweet soy sauce. I am sure this luxury is thrown on upon many, but no one else around us seemed to have received this so we couldn\u2019t help but feel smug !  Dessert felt like a step too far and I desperately did not want to feel sluggish particularly because we were about to shoot down 38 floors at some speed in an elevator.  The atmosphere around us was great, although most of it I think I missed because my tastebuds were so distracted by this exuberant dinner-time dance and we were in deep discussion about the marriage of flavours and cuisines we were enjoying. Of course though you can\u2019t help but remember that it is an instagrammers dream, and for many it is a chance to show off, not a problem, but grating. The couple next to us talking too loudly about the champagne they\u2019d ordered the massive dish of Lobster Maki, lobster, nashi pear, grilled white asparagus, truffle aji amarillo, 10g oscietra caviar, 5g black truffle, crispy nori plus other dishes all of which were \u00a365+ and then once they\u2019d arrived seemingly had zero idea as to what they had ordered. I don\u2019t want to sound arrogant but hearing someone ask if a \u00a365 plate of succulent lobster was seabass made me want to get up, take the dish away and say you don\u2019t deserve this (not okay I know !) What I think we proved though was that you don\u2019t have to pay stupid money for dishes at SushiSamba, we paid no more than \u00a317 per dish and they were sensational. It\u2019s the perfect place for a special occasion, a romantic evening or just a moment to drink in the real beauty of the city that we often miss when rushing from tube to office. It\u2019s pricey but it\u2019s worth it, and the lift ride is free.", "date_of_review": "24 February 2019"}

A visit to the tree is almost a ritual, and then in for dinner. The service is exceptional. I like the way you can tell the waiter how hungry you are, what you like - they then add some other options and you can decide - and then dishes arrive...And every one was spot on. By the time we got to dessert (which was also very good), we were nicely full. Wine service was also very good and you don't have to break the bank. All told, including service, it was around \u00a3100pp. We didn't need anything else.

The food is very good and there is a lot of choice, we really enjoyed every one of our dishes and ordered another one of nearly all of them as they were so delicious.

The bar area is really nice and buzzy, but the restaurant is just really nothing special, especially if you don\u2019t get a seat close to a window so no view. The service was dreadful, we had different waiters and had to keep asking for water etc. To be topped up, they got a drinks order wrong and tried to argue it was our fault. Then when the bill finally came it was completely wrong and they had added a \u00a3129 dish on that we had not ordered, I think they think if you are a group that has had a few drinks you won\u2019t notice and try to get away with adding things on! Lucky we checked and told the man who brought the bill over, he was so rude no apology, when I asked how that happened he just shrugged and said I don\u2019t know mistake. We were then rushed to leave they couldn\u2019t get us out quick enough, we hadn\u2019t even finished our drinks and they practically threw us out. I\u2019ve honestly never met someone so rude working in hospitality in my whole life. We also witnessed and overheard the waiters talking about people at the tills ( as our table was right by there) which a lot of other people have noted too.

The shopkeepers were greatly apologized for winning us a glass of champagne and three first dishes, about 45 pounds. I got a lot of meats that I loved very much and all the accompanying dishes were of high quality, both in their presentation and in their taste. The service was also of a high standard, for the space I do not have much to say, just on the 38 floor of a skyscraper everything seems amazing.", "date_of_review": "11 January 2019"}

The head waiter was very aggressive and had no finesse. We were not even able to finish our wine or order a dessert. I have been to many restaurants in many countries, and have never been treated like this. The manager then came to tell us that it is written ( in very small print ) that there is a maximum 2 hr policy. We had not seen this, so be warned and quite honestly when eating out at a restaurant that has a reputation of class and quality, one does not expect to be treated like this.

I came here for a surprise birthday dinner. On arrival, the guy at the front desk said we had 1hour and 30mins on the table as we were late to our reservation. Half an hour in and at the middle of eating our mains, the waitress in a very rude manner, interrupted us while we were eating and asked if we wanted to order desserts, rushing us to finish our mains, despite having an hour left on the table. After we finished we asked one of the other waitress if it would be okay to order a cake as a surprise for our friend as we didn't want her to find out. Instead, on return from the toilet, we find the bill had been presented to the birthday girl! I asked our waitress if she received the order I placed with her colleague and she rudely replied 'I asked you earlier if you wanted dessert and you said no!'. We paid the bill and left with 30 minutes to spare on the table as we couldn't tolerate such terrible service any longer.

We had a combination of cocktails and red wine - the valpolicella was the cheapest on their wine list but light and fruity! We had a number of sharing platters, but want to give a shout out for the lobster taquitos, lamb chops with miso and lime and the eggplant! Amongst the sushi the Neo Tokyo and the El Topo were a favourite amongst our group... I was too full for dessert but the rest of our group shared the dulce de leche and chocolate and banana cake which were delish!

My 10-year-old sister saw a desert on a table next to us, we asked for the same. Waiters went to the kitchen twice but the chef *refused* to serve it as it is part of the (cheap) set menu while we were ordering from (expensive!) a la carte. Why?? First time i see a restaurant do this, and that is after spending 100 pounds per person. City views are good, food is alright (not exceptional), but that goes without saying for a not-so-cheap London venue. My second time at Sushisamba, and definitely my last one.

The lift was a good experience with a great view of St Paul's cathedral and London. We arrived early for drinks and I enquired to see if our table was ready earlier, unfortunately it wasn't so we explored the outdoor bar and purchased some drinks. After we purchased drinks we decided to sit indoors on some available sofa seats opposite the bar, as we sat for a maximum of 20 seconds an obnoxious arrogant waitress approached us aggressively and indicated we had to move from the area. Unknown to me the seats were reserved and I asked her if our table was now ready, she only replied with \"you have to move now\" 3 times and then implied that i have to ask someone else if my table was ready. This made me feel like we weren't good enough to be there and despite the area being reserved and her doing her job, i felt she could have explained this in a more respectful way, after all our money is a good as anyone else! Neither of us are big fans of seafood as we are both vegetarian however I was impressed as we were provided with a separate vegetarian/vegan menu which had plenty of choice. The food itself was tasty with a fusion of flavours and a tapas style menu. The service whilst we were seated was fantastic and our table waitress was very attentive and explained the menu well. The prices were reasonable for a up market London restaurant with good views and a nice ambience, unfortunately the terrace was close and this is dependant on weather conditions, however the outside bar was open with sofas and blankets to relax with a good atmosphere. My only regret is not getting the name of the waitress who was rude so I could make a formal complaint, apart from that it was a good experience.", "date_of_review": "5 October 2018"}

Beautifully presented. We had 2 drinks each and were there for about an hour and a half. The views are spectacular and the decour is beautiful. I think it's probably great for city workers looking for a quick meal if they have lots of money to drop; however, defo not worth the \u00a3120 or so to me. There are also a bewildering number of staff - I think we must have had at least 6 waiters? It would have been fine if we didn't keep being asked the same questions, (e.g. whether we wanted a drink when we'd already ordered one). Little bit chaotic - but the number of staff explains the 13.5% service charge I guess?! The staff also seemed quite disappointed when we decide not to have edamame, another drink, dessert, etc... We even were told as we were paid our bill that next time we really should have dessert. It just felt like a little bit of pushy upselling.

The restaurant confirmed the arrangement would be noted to staff to ensure I wouldn\u2019t have to explain myself to anyone in front of my client. We arrived on time but no staff were aware of the arrangement. We sat at a table for 2 with a fantastic view. I whispered in the ear of our waiter regarding the offer. He knew nothing about it.

The two ladies ahead of us had just wiggled their way through the door staff using the same ID, even though the door men took a \u2018good look\u2019 at their photographic ID, but were still clearly oblivious. I stepped forward, they looked me up and down along with a well-built (rugby player) friend behind me and said we weren\u2019t coming in.

A colleague of his, (another waste of space) then stepped directly in front of me, which wasn\u2019t the most professional thing to do to try and intimidate us. I\u2019d asked how they\u2019d come to that conclusion considering what had just happened in front of us with the ID, after a quick blank look at one another, they then had nothing to say.  The staff at this venue are unbelievably rude, and it was such a disappointment. They\u2019re clearly power obsessed and by the looks of things, think it\u2019s their responsibility to let who they like the look of in which also seemed to be mainly females.

I said that I would have rather paid after the food and the drinks were to be served. I'm Italian and I was there with some other Italian friends. She was clearly Italian as well, but said that because of my nationality, I wouldn't know that the custom, in England, is to pay before the food, and in general when the server wants to, for this reason I could have either paid now or open a tap at the counter. She then went on asking me, how long have I lived in England without knowing this. This whole event was completely surreal, It was embarrassing for me in front of my friends and for her, clearly not used to deal with customers In the end, unfortunately I would not recommend this place to anybody.

Located very close to Liverpool St Station, so nice and easy to get to, the building is huge and you can\u2019t miss the big SushiSamba sign on the outside. The entrance is the same as to Duck and Waffle.  You head up 38 floors, at speed on the all glass elevator and it\u2019s a great view of London! Worth taking a photo :)  The restaurant itself is very nice with lots of warm lighting but colourful and elegant furniture, fairy lights on the trees in the outdoor bar area, views of London on all sides of the glass walls, it\u2019s all very picturesque.  Started with some cocktails, espresso martinis and fruity cocktails ordered & went down a real treat! The beer selection was limited, but expected. They had a vast selection of wine and saki to choose if that\u2019s more your thing however.  Now down to the food, I\u2019m a sushi fan, and wow, this place didn\u2019t disappoint! Seriously fresh ingredients, including freshly grated wasabi at the table (at an extra \u00a34 supplement), I highly recommend trying the fresh stuff! It\u2019s a lot more subtle than the normal wasabi and very flavoursome! The standard wasabi was also good however!  We ordered a mix of everything on the menu, obviously a variety of sushi, sashimi, nigiri, a large plate of mushrooms with a steamed egg all in a sauce which was immense (if your looking to order something a little different and your not sure what to get, go for this!), some gyozas, buns and vegetables along with tempura dishes, we also tried the Kobe beef sashimi, more intrigued more than anything else - but yes, it was melt in the mouth and full of flavour! I would also recommend trying if your visiting!  In the end we ordered the equivalent of probably 2 dishes each, and this was enough with the mix of large sushi platers and large mushroom dish.  Some more cocktails on order and then we went for dessert, everyone loved theirs, however I\u2019m not a dessert fan, but I ventured away from my normal order of \u2018double shot of espresso please\u2019 and went for the fruit selection, the exotic fruit which contained dragon fruit & lychees come out in a martini glass accompanied with a cocktail shaker which contained watermelon crushed ice and a shot of citrus on the side! The idea being you mix the citrus in with the cocktail mixer containing the melon and eat / drink combined! Was a nice, fun and very refreshing way to end the meal. Overall a fantastic venue, great service, an excellent experience, with great views over London and of course, very good food & drink.  I would return for sure!

Our meal was delicious and beautifully presented but the service ranged from indifferent to rude, with the exception of two delightful waiters. The restaurant had so many waiters - there appeared to be an upper level of supervising waiters and these were amongst the most rude. Within earshot I heard them discussing guests (well behaved) at another table which obviously made me question what these waiters were saying about us! The first waiter who explained the menu to us was bored out of his brain and showed it. This waiter virtually rolled his eyes with the sommelier when we declined his offer of a second bottle of wine. Another very charming waiter was having a chat with us and was literally pulled away mid-sentence by his superior, without any reference to us, as plates were thrust into his hands for another table ...  For me, a major part of the enjoyment of eating out is the interaction with the staff and the ambience. Sushi samba definitely failed my expectations of the former. The rude waiters would put me off returning there. Meanwhile thank you to Indrid (and a colleague who worked in the outside bar) whose friendliness and super service saved the evening.  The three stars were awarded because the food was delicious ... I\u2019d award one for service.", "date_of_review": "19 September 2018"}

The venue has a dress code of no sportswear which is fine, but we watched many casually dressed people enter whilst we were held outside before entrance was allowed. Not the most auspicious start The good bit- 38 floors up, fab views, and decor is outstanding- fab to walk through a copy of a famous shinto shrine where we've recently been. However after that the positives stop. Food was average with one or two above average dishes. Service haphazard- we had empty water glasses frequently and no-one checked.

We were also told by the doorman on the ground floor that as we had arrived at 6.45 for a 7pm table reservation, a private function in the restaurant meant our table was not ready so we had to go to the duck and waffle bar to wait. When we then asked a hostess at 7pm whether our table was ready they said it had always been ready - basically they got us to spend \u00a350 on cocktails in their bar when we could have been at our table.  Then whilst we were eating, a cleaner was walking around the dining room mopping the floor even under our table which was particularly unpleasant. I was very surprised to see this was happening even under the watchful eye of the supposed manager who just seemed to watch the whole dining room for the 2 hours we were there and didn\u2019t do anything. For a restaurant with such a beautiful view and tasty food made by the chefs, the waiting staff let down the experience and chefs with few smiles (until it came to paying the bill when the guy taking the payment was very smiley!).

Views were spectacular and the elevator to the top was brilliant. Pre dinner Drinks at the bar were ok but steep at \u00a314 for a cocktail or mixer. Opted to not do the tasting menu as we had a pescatarian with us and the restaurant was unable/ unwilling to swap out the meat dishes.  Meal was ok, however the Sushi was sub par comparable to wasabi or yo sushi etc . The Brazilian portion of the meal was much nicer and the moqueca was delicious.  A lotta been made of the dress code and we made sure to dress accordingly .... however people were seated in ripped jeans tshirts etc. The meal at around \u00a3100 each was expensive. Oh yeah, called up prior to see if we could bring a birthday cake and told that would incur a cost of \u00a37.50 per person!!! I have never heard of corkage on Birthday cake!!!

My partner can't eat fish but all the dishes I've smelled and looked delicious. We start with some veggie sushi and the moved on to the Kobe. Sylvain served it and showed us how to cook it on the well-presented hot stone. It was a superb meat with a perfect matching sauces on the side, even though i believe you don't even need them. We ordered as well the rib-eye picanha chorizo board. Again, it was superb. We followed our server recommendation for the dessert and they were both delicious.

Here we go. Sushi Samba is an amazing place for its venue and menu. We feel quiet privileged passing the door waiting for the elevator, which offered an incredible view over the city of London. Upon arrival to the restaurant, we were rapidly served and informed that our table would be ready as per booking time. (7pm) No problem at all, we were early to enjoy the fantastic cocktail menu and enjoy our time. It was a team night out that we wanted to be special. It definitely became special from there. Our table was ready with a delay of 20min, despite the clear instruction for customer to be on time, dress code etc. However, that`s not a problem we were very understanding. We sat enjoyed the view and panorama, once again incredible. Florian, then arrived introducing himself as our waiter for the night. We explained that it was our first time and we did not know how it worked. We also had three persons with dietary requirement (pregnant and coeliac + dairy allergy). He barely acknowledged that with an \u2018OK\u2019 and continue his speech of introduction. All in all, we managed to understand the menu, get the necessary information (because our friend emailed your team prior to our visit to avoid any misunderstanding) and place our order. It was explained that everything more or less comes together as it is a sharing concept, still no worries there. The worries started here. One then two individual dishes turned up. Then a big one with three different kind of rolls on it that we ordered. Then all the other dishes turned up finishing by the \u2018Lamb chops\u2019 on two plates (we ordered three portions). Putting them on the table, Florian reassured us that a third plate of lamb chops was coming. We were still missing one order of Ezo rolls thus enquired about it. The plates looked stunning so we took loads of pictures. Pictures we showed to Florian to assure him that we were indeed missing a dish. For such a \u2018fancy\u2019 place, the decent customer service would have been for him to refuse and believe us instead of eagerly wanting to see the pictures proving us right. Apparently \u201cthe chefs are difficult in the kitchen\u201d, ok fine. After a while, no sign of the third plate of lamb nor the Ezo. So we asked again. Only then Florian mentioned that the three portions have been served to us already split onto the two plates. \u201cI was confused too\u201d he says. Here is a simple question, if your waiter himself was confused by the way dishes were served, how could we, first time customers, know? The two portions were eaten by two people, and were still short of two dishes. The simple thing to do here would have been to apologise and get the last portion made and brought to the table. Instead Florian argued and disappear without a word. A second man, suited, then approached our table asking \u201cis everything ok?\u201d to which we responded \u201cno, but your colleague is sorting it, so no worries\u201d. Should we have known that this man was the Manager offering his help, would have avoided us another load of delay and argument. I could go on and on, but I`m sure we can agree that this email is already too long. It was an important occasion for us and we wanted to have a special time in a special place. The dishes and cocktails received were absolutely fantastic. But the service recovery, atrocious. Florian should have owned up to his mistake and sorted it out. Marc, should have introduced himself has a Manager instead of arguing childishly that we sent him away so he would not help us. His body language is also questionable. Whilst trying to resolve the issue with a member of our party, he was towering over her, using a condescending tone. I don`t think this has ever made anyone feel comfortable and heard. All members of our party work in catering industry and therefore know very well that sometimes mistake happens and we would have never been difficult about it. Insinuating that we are lying, and switching the error onto us is definitely another story. I know I lost it with Florian, and for that I`m very sorry.

", "comment": "We wanted to watch a World Cup game and somebody told us about this place, when we got there the hostess told us there was no available tables at the bar, since we were a party of 12 we understood but when we saw there were several empty tables we asked to be seated even if we were not together and they agreed, we ordered the food and we were told that since we were ordering a lot of food that they give priority to reserved tables, non sense to me but anyway, we asked for ponzu sauce and spicy mayo we were told that they were 1pound each, which was ok for us, we never got the sauces, when we got the check we were charged 6pounds for sauces that never got there, we were a table of 4 and we were paying 300pounds but when we said we never got the sauces they didn\u2019t want to remove them from the check! It is not like 6pounds would make any difference but the least they could do was take them away!  At the end we felt they were doing us a favor by serving us food. I will have only one positive thing to say, the restaurant looks really nice, we were seating at the bar, hopefully the service in the restaurant is better it\u2019s a shame I will never know since I have no intention of coming here again!

Staff were very helpful and polite....service was very good.....music was good. Now the negatives.......do not go expecting great views over London as the restaurant is pointing in the wrong direction.. Food is totally overpriced and small portions. Wine list is extensive but a lot of silly prices....... Forget what they say about the dress code as far as I could see it did not exist.. Tables do appear to be on top of each other and I think if restaurant was fully booked it would not be that comfortable. Can fully recommend the Drift Bar (ground floor...Heron tower round the corner) for a pre dinner drink .

As someone who eats out at least 3 times a week and have eaten in many places all over the world, all I can say is that I was disappointed and actually disgusted by the whole experience from start to finish. We were greeted by a very rude and obnoxious door man who clearly thought he was checking us in to a much finer establishment than it actually is. He told my daughter that she couldn\u2019t come in with the shoes that she was wearing (luckily my friend had some she could wear) my daughter\u2019s shoes were beautiful summer sandals (pictures to follow) after this frosty greeting, which put me off instantly as I saw the other diners he was allowing in with terrible dress attire. We then were checked by security, I understand the need for this of course, acting very aggressively and so pretentious the security check was a quick glance in my handbag which was utterly pointless and did not fill me with any reassurance that security is taken seriously. The ride in the elevator was the best bit overlooking the spectacular views of the city. We arrived and spoke to the hostess who said she would find us when the table was ready . We ordered drinks at the bar and my daughter changed back into her original shoes as there were several women in the same style of summer sandal and indeed some wearing flip flops and scruffy trainers. As soon as she did this, the rudest security guard wearing an ear piece and acting like he was in the secret service came over and told her to put the original shoes on. I pointed out the other women wearing similar and worse shoes and he just told me that she had to wear the other shoes. I asked to see the manager immediately. The manager accepted my point and apologised and said she could wear her shoes. This whole episode was completely unnecessary and really annoyed me and obviously tainted my first impressions. The venue is pretty but seriously not worth the hype. We had to search for the hostess to sit us- way after our reservation time which again is sloppy and unprofessional. For quite a pricey restaurant I expect much better service than we got. The food was actually nice, the waiters are atrocious. We had all of our dishes except one sushi plate, which after 45 minutes of waiting asked for it to be cancelled as we weren\u2019t hungry anymore. (How does sushi take 45 mins to come out?) The staff were possibly the rudest and most pretentious people I have ever met. They clearly think this place sushi samba is the place to be! It really isn\u2019t. It is terrible and their attitudes are really disgusting.", "date_of_review": "5 July 2018"}

I live in London and my friends with kids came over from Germany and Middle East. I saw in an article that Sushisamba was broadcasting world cup football games so I called the reservation team to confirm it was the case. I'd been told that they did broadcast all football games indeed. In two hours time, my friends - two couples with kids - arrived at the restaurant, went up to the 38th floor but the host on duty told them that they were not going to broadcast the game we wanted to watch. They said the venue was closed for private hire. My friends with kids had to go back to their hotel. I arrived a bit later and called the reservation team to ask what was going on there and they didn't have an answer but promised to call back. 30 minutes later they called me back and said they were experiencing a technical problem. All in all my friends and I missed the first half of the game, incurred some costs taking a cab to the restaurant and back and had to arrange an alternative very fast. The reservation team manager Maris called me the following day and offered a round of drinks and snacks in the bar, if we wanted to come back.

A couple next to us ordered a drink at the bar, and because of the loud music, the bartender was unable to hear them so instead starting yelling at them for not speaking proper English - scary stuff!!

We arrived early for our reservation so we got a drink at the bar and waited for our table. An Old Fashion is my drink of choice so I ordered their Sesame Old Fashioned which was a letdown. If you love the taste of sesame then you might enjoy this, but I couldn't even finish the drink because it tasted so bad. Luckily the food made up for it. We ordered the Lobster Taquitos and Kobe Sliders for starters and both were delicious. For mains we had 4 different rolls and all of them were terrific.

The outdoor terrace was nice but you cannot enjoy views from there, instead the bar and tree with orange lights takes centre stage.  We sat with our drinks near the window almost under the stairs being very careful not to hit out heads.  The drinks were lovely, the waiting staff at the bar area were very keen to take out glasses away even when we had not finished our drinks. I had to stop them twice, after spending \u00a313 on a drink you want to finish it.  Our table was booked for 8.15 it was ready for 8.30, we ordered a mixture of items all were very nice but we all agreed that the vegan cucumber maki was bland and very fishy in taste. The desserts were beautifully presented and different to the usual standard dessert you normally get. The chocolate banana cake was strange but the more you try it the better it became.  Overall it was a lovely evening, the waiting staff in the restaurant were very polite attentive and knowlegable about the menu.

Couldn\u2019t fault the food but the service of higher management (waiter was very polite) is absolutely shocking. We had a waiter who explained the menu and looked after us well.

I have no problem with tipping and feel \u00a320 as a tip is more than appropriate regardless of being a high end restaurant in London.

As soon as we were seated, as in, not a minute had passed, we were seen by a waiter who asked us what we wanted to drink (we hadn\u2019t even seen the menus), he sped through a list of options, incredibly quickly to which we said, can we just have a minute to look at the menu. He then said ok and I\u2019ll bring you tap water. A few minutes after he returned and took our order, the three of us had an incredibly busy day and neither had a chance to eat so we were looking forward to food even more, we started our order and our waiter stopped us. He then said, this is too much food, we were so confused and he told us to stop ordering and that what we have is enough. I had actually only placed an order for myself and two sushi plates to share. My other two friends hadn\u2019t even ordered. He re-iterated that we have enough food and that\u2019s it, we felt so pressured to shut up we didn\u2019t know what else to say. He left and a few minutes after we were wondering what just happened. We decided we were being silly and to just order what we each wanted, another gentleman saw we were looking for a waiter and asked us, we added two additional dishes. Moments after the original waiter came back and essentially told us off. He said, I\u2019ve heard you want to order more, again telling us it\u2019s too much and what we were going to do when we don\u2019t eat it. We were so completely taken aback. We asked what the issue was and that surely, if we didn\u2019t finish something, we could take it away if that was the issue, to which he said, no you can\u2019t do that, this is too much. By this point we were so fed up, he said fine, your choice and walked off.  Just to put into context, three of us ordered a small plate each as a starter and shared some sushi plates. I then ordered the cod for a main and my two friends shared the seafood plate. That was it. We ate what we ordered, paid and left feeling incredibly frustrated and as if we had been shamed for eating what we did. I am so incredibly disgusted by your waiters behaviour and neither of us will be returning. What an awful awful experience. Don\u2019t waste your time.", "date_of_review": "14 April 2018"}

From a business meeting point of view, as you order several smaller courses, the meal is dragged out giving ample time to discuss business if you need to. There's not a lot of ambient noise in the restaurant and the tables are sufficiently spaced out that you can hold a private conversation. The food was excellent, especially the Black Cod. The waiter was very helpful in answering our questions about the menu and he made suggestions on what to order (how many dishes to serve 3 people, what the dishes were comprised of etc). We probably ordered too much food to be fair and one large plate easily served 3 of us (4 would have been a push) considering we had lots of smaller plates, nigiri and sashimi etc. The dishes don't come out in any structured order, just when they're ready, so it's best to order for the table rather than individuals as some will be eating whilst others are still waiting.

At the table we were faced with a fusion of dining dishes and the waitress who took our order, seemed set on telling us what to order without listening to what we said - some of our party had eaten here before and we didn't need to be told! Her English was also very poor and I'm not sure how much she understood us! The food was tasty and arrived very quickly but the clearing of the dishes was almost as fast and two platters went without being finished - and at these prices, you'd want to eat every bite.  We decided to terminate the meal after the final dish of eight dishes and move on for our dessert and coffees. It was very noisy and not at all relaxed - the plethora of staff seemed to fall over each other and consequently, good service got lost. I wondered what they were all employed to do as many of them were suited and watching?  London has many beautiful restaurants and as locals, we have visited a lot of them. This doesn't make the grade though. Far too expensive, not enough food per platter and terrible service. I would love to train these staff in how to discreetly deliver a brilliant service as the views could do the rest but I think I'd never be able to break through the pomp. Which is a shame as the food was good but with so much choice in London, I wont be back!", "date_of_review": "18 March 2018"}

This place is simply unique and you definitely need to try i once in your life. The location is first of all beautiful and it is an added value to your visit. Fine dining on the top of a skyscraper is something always extremely cool! Also the atmosphere and the lights! Everything is looked after and you are treat as a prince. The waiters are definitely kind and guide you choosing the maybe not immediately easy to understand menu with competence and sympaty. I recommend you trying something of everything varying between the Sushi, the Brazilian and the Peruvian kitchen. Everything will be amazing!I rarely had such flavours and decoration in a dish and all is an explosion of flavours and colors. I suggest you trying especially the Samba rolls, the large churrasco plate and also to conclude with some of the delicious desserts offered. You can of course imagine all of this don't come in a cheap way, but I can assure you I was happy to pay for what I had. For a good dining here without renouncing to anything expect to pay between 70 and 100 \u00a3 each.

We were very pleasantly surprised by the desserts too - Zen Garden and Rainforest were just stunning and my husbands chocolate banana pudding was delicious too. Yes it\u2019s expensive with a couple of eye watering prices on the menu, but really worth it.  The one complaint wasn\u2019t that it was really busy and noisy - which it was but just added to the great vibe - but that there was a cleaning lady with a mop working her way round the place even under tables where people were sitting which struck us as a bit odd and could perhaps have been better done only when staff were very efficiently turning tables for the next booking. I do accept the need for good hygiene and to keep the place looking at its best but it was a little intrusive and out of place. However that wouldn\u2019t stop us from going again when we next have an opportunity to do so - we just need another great excuse to treat ourselves!

I was then told because I had spent a certain amount they had allowed me and my partner to stay a little extra, I found this rather insulting, there were 2 clear opportunities to convey the seating period was for only 2 hours, once at the hostess desk and another when we were seated at the table, had we been reminded prior I would not off have an issue with being told to leave. The amount spent should not be a concern, providing good customer service should take precedence. Regardless I didn't argue however asked that the bottle of champagne which we was half empty be transferred to the bar, this was agreed and I was told to speak with the bar staff.

I eat in amazing places all the time and I am more than happy to spend \u00a360 - \u00a390 ahead of it's really worth it, however in this instance I just really wasn't impressed by anything all evening, The restaurant itself is very nice, good ambience, although the waiters seemed quite disorganised (not knowing which table some dishes were supposed to go to, and also just crowded together at times looking lost) and not as attentive as you'd expect - although a head waiter was very polite and helpful with explaining the menu. The only prosecco they had on the menu was \u00a353 which I would quite extortionate... The menu itself is okay we managed to pick out 7 dishes to share which I guess was enough to fill two ladies up but probably not if you had a big appetite! The sushi was very average unfortunately - the crab was extremely fishy, almost tuna like. And the mushroom dish we had the egg was not cooked all the way through. All in all, we had a good evening but only because of the nice ambiance and great company. (We chose a \u00a333 pinto grigio in the end which was lovely) I thought this would be a new place to add to my list of incredible London restaurants but unfortunately I do not think I would come back here as I can think of many other places to eat amazing sushi, and wouldn't want to be disappointed again.

The only available time was 4:30pm, which i thought sucked, but how mistaken I was! Honestly this was the best time to visit this place, because you get to experience it in daylight and sunset - BEAUTIFUL! Atmosphere When you get to the 38th floor by super was elevator you're amazed how high you are! There are two areas of the restaurant one is bar (split between two floors) and the dining area. Bar area that was on the same level as dining hall was quite crowded as you would expect it, but dining area was very spacious with glass windows all around, so the view is stunning. I also loved decor of small light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and when it got darker the room turned into a magic place. There are couple of balconies where you can go, enjoy the view and take nice photos. I absolutely loved the tree with lights - God how beautiful it was. Really something magical and well done to the designers. Food We were four and we ordered 4 types of rolls, 3 miso soups and scallop ceviche to try. it was plenty of food for all of us. Also left space for dessert - I went for beetroot flavoured dessert (Samabeet), my friends chose chocolate cake & banana cake and Welcome to the rainforest. I loved my dessert as it was unusual to try and it was delicious. My friends thought that chocolate and banana cake was a bit too sweet. Sushi were perfect. I especially loved California maki, which was made with actual crab meat and not crab flavoured fish meat/stick. This roll came with truffle oil sauce and the combination of crab meat and this oil was an absolute delight. We also ordered Ezo maki, Samba London and Unagi Maki. Scallop ceviche was too small to share, but we just wanted to try it. Too sweet for me, but depends on what you like in favour combinations. The scallops were raw, but incredibly fresh. I had many ceviche in my life and to be honest I have had much better, but as I say it is a matter of preference. Drinks I had crushed mango drink, can't remember the name of it, but loved every bit of it as I like mango. I had non alcoholic version and tried the same with alcohol, but it was was too strong for me so was happy with my choice. Service I really enjoyed how polite were waiters and how much attention they dedicated to guests as it really added to the experience.  Price Yes - it is expensive, you are 38 floors above the ground after all :) However it is well worth the money as food was really, really fresh. For 4 people we paid \u00a3188 inclusive of service charge and drinks, so not so bad. Cons We ordered drinks together and they were brought first for two people and then after 30 minutes to other two, which i found quite strange. So to have a toast for my birthday we needed to wait until everyone had a drink. But I think there was some kind of a mess up in the bar, which caused the delay. There were two waiters who served us food. The first one just came and left the food on the table, we started to eat and then the second person came to explain what each dish was about. To be honest I was expecting this to be done by one and the same person rather than when we're already eating and someone is coming to interrupt and explain the dishes. The whole experience would have been much better, because I was surprised why the first waiter didn't bother to comment anything on what he brought. Also dessert was brought to us when not all people where at the table, so ice-cream on top of the cake was melting while some people got back to the table from bathroom.  So this element of service definitely needs to be improved as if restaurant is charging so much money for the experience it needs to deliver up to price. Especially knowing that people are willing to wait for many months to get a table. There are definitely enough waiters on the floor to observe dining dynamic of each table and provide high class service. Overall recommendation Definitely go and choose for your special occasion or simply treat yourself. I will definitely come again and hopefully service will be improved. and thank you very much for a little macaroon with the birthday candle - it was a nice touch!", "date_of_review": "3 March 2018"}

We loved the whole experience, and ordering from the separate vegan menu is always handy rather than scanning through the whole regular menu. We had a fab corner window table, and all bar 1 dish we received we absolutely loved. It's always refreshing when the vegan items are given as much care and attention as the rest of the food! The nigiri / maki selection in particular was incredible.. the \u00a34 for fresh wasabi was a bit ridiculous considering the price of the dishes it should be free of charge..  The lychee and mango cooler cocktails were to.die.for! Even if you go for drinks you will have a wonderful time, it's a shame the terrace wasn't open but it was a freezing cold night.  The toilets are the only place where they could have been improvement - they were dirty, dark and so cold. For somewhere where people are regularly spending into the \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3s this really needs to be addressed.

Then on taking our table, we were somewhat confused by the very onerous \u201cit\u2019s all about Samba Sushi and not about the customer\u201d RULES on how we were allowed to spend a significant amount of money with this restaurant - with 2 children we were not allowed to order 2 of the larger/expensive and 2 of the smaller less expensive set menus as the whole table had to have the same - a rule without any logical reason or justification as of course, if we had separated and seated on different tables this would have been OK - I offered to put the children on the next door table to make the point. So although the food was pretty good and the service was timely, we were left with that feeling that the restaurant believed that is was bigger than the customer - complacency derived from location and with the competitive nature of the London market, one that usually comes back to bite you on the sashimi.

Food wise it certainly ticks many of the boxes you look for in portion size, quality and cost, be sure to have a sharer platter as you get great variety and it certainly is not lacking in portions. The steak and the black cod were excellent and perhaps are best shared between 4 or more people, it is a costly meal and you will find yourself full up having eating the sushi share platters!. Don't let your eyes be bigger than your belly in here as the whole menu will appeal to you if you enjoy this kind of Food! It's perhaps better suited to warm days if you are going in the afternoon as you can enjoy the outdoor terraced area with a cocktail beneath the big red tree, unfortunately it was bitterly cold on the day of our visit so we stayed at the table which offered little benefit of the panoramic view. (If you are visiting London be sure to book in advance). I would like to see this venue at night as perhaps it will have more of a buzz to It, it seemed a little flat in the mid afternoon but perhaps at night in the summer when people enjoy the terrace area for cocktails that will kick it up a notch. If you want a nice venue with a view of the city, somewhere for lunch a little quieter than perhaps some of the more high street style restaurants, this will do just nicely.

However, even before we arrived, we were not looking forward to our visit as much as we should have been and, sadly, things did not improve. The customer service (or lack of) we received from the reservations team prior to our visit was awful \u2013 they were far from helpful and frankly, rather rude. The \u2018welcoming\u2019 staff at the bottom of Heron Tower were anything but welcoming: when we arrived, we were asked whether we had a reservation to which we answered \u2018no\u2019 (our name was still on the waiting list). We were asked to step aside to let other people in, which confused us because we were the only people at the entrance. We did as requested and, after a few minutes, were directed to the lifts.  We arrived at Sushi Samba\u2019s reception and, as our name was still on the waiting list, we were given a table at the sushi counter (we were happy with this). Things improved when our waiter introduced himself (sadly, we didn\u2019t get his name) \u2013 he was very polite and friendly. The only downside was that we were rushed to order and our food arrived in record speed. The reasoning behind the lightening service became clear \u2013 we were presented with our bill and asked to pay immediately because the seating time at the counter was a maximum of one hour. Neither the reservations team, nor the receptionist, mentioned this \u2013 it was the icing on the cake. The food was great, but the service completely ruined our evening. Manners, and customer service cost nothing, but go a very long way. I recently had lunch at a well-known French rooftop restaurant in the City \u2013 my experience could not have been more different. Sushi Samba could definitely learn a lot from the staff at this restaurant!  Following our visit, I wrote an email directly to the reservations team to provide feedback on our visit. I received a response and was told I would be contacted by Sushi Samba\u2019s management team to discuss my concerns \u2013 three months later and I\u2019m still waiting to be contacted!

We were both on dry Jan, so can't comment on the alcohol but we made up for it on the food. We had the squid, two serviche dishes, the black cod, the samba london rolls, Ezo rolls and the smoked eel sashimi. It was hard to pick a winner, as all of it was delicious and perfectly timed in terms of delivery. The tuna seriviche was probably the tastiest thing I have had in a long time, but the black cod came a close second - the texture was delicious and it just fell apart.

However water was served and asked the waiter 10 minutes to take the time to order. Few minutes late a girl came and took the drinks order, a glass of wine and 2 cocktails. The wine was delivered after 2 minutes and the cocktails were delivered after the food was served. After 15 minutes we were looking around and eventually a different girl approached and asked if we were ready. Ordered and the food was delivered pretty quickly to be honest...but as I said cocktails were served after that so at that point we could not even make a toast so we waited to have the drinks while food was on the table.

The staff downstairs pretended to check my bag as we entered the premises but gave up after looking at me and then we took the lift to the 38th floor where Sushi Samba is located.  Indeed the place has some good views over London with limited views from the Tree bar area or even parts of the restaurants and bar and as we were asked to wait we ordered our cocktails in the bar area assuming the restaurant will be packed. Some 10min later we were taken in a two thirds full restaurant and placed at the first table you see when you enter the restaurant being told we will be moved to a window some 30min later!!!???? I knew straight away that something was off as soon as the staff told us that, as I could easily see free tables near the window as people who were arriving were placed straight away there, probably because the European staff assumed these touristy looking people would be higher tippers? We ordered 6 dishes (after trying to make eye contact with the staff several times but they kept looking away despite passing right near us) and even my partner who is normally easily pleased with everything did not like any of his food, either because the dishes were too small, too salty (or not having much lobster in the Tiquitos) - he said is the worst London Japanese restaurant he ever dined in. As we arrived home he had to start eating again as he was so hungry. The management moved us to a corner table in the end (having some Chinese girls near us who did not order any food or drinks but kept texting all the time and were still texting as we left!!!??), after complaining of having my chair hit by people coming and going all the time............. I could not even touch the headache inducing Champagne they offered. My partner removed the service charge imposed as the fake smiles the staff gave us, the slow management response, the terrible food and poor settings did not impress us. Maybe when packed with suits this place looks more interesting, however in holiday times this place looks more like a canteen packed with people that make you check your belongings all the time. Interestingly, as we left, I noticed another couple was set in our initial table despite most of the tables in the middle and even the ones near the window were empty: what is the staff doing in this place? Surely this would come across as strange to lots of logical thinking people.

The staircase going up to the next floor made the seating area behind awkward to access - but the staff were friendly and co-operative. They scored highly, especially the bar staff. The route into the restaurant passed a very colourful wall but the dining area was a huge disappointment - loads of grey and glass. I suspect the many ceiling lights made this atmospheric in the evenings, but during the day it was dead. The food was fabulous - the portions tiny, the presentation beautiful and teased the eye and the service fine. However the cost of the food was stratospheric - never have I seen such excessive prices. Wagu beef at \u00a31,000 was one option we by-passed.

Having arrived at 930pm, we were greeted very professionally at the gate, and were led to the elevator- -which was actually a lot of fun, zipping up fast to the 38th floor. (you will have to pop your ears!)  The main dining hall is an impressive room, with high ceiling and dim lighting. The views were to die for and we spent an entire 15 minutes just figuring out where London's main landmarks were.  For dinner, we had salmon ceviche, lamb chops and sushi. I don't remember the particular name as I was invited for dinner.  Sushi: the most amazing ones I've had so far. Entirely fresh, delicate and full of taste. I could taste each and every element of the sushi.  All in all, a wonderful experience and am definitely going to make this a regular visit each time I come to London!  Well done to the entire team at Sushisamba!", "date_of_review": "23 November 2017"}

We chose el topo and the Californian maki, which were both delicious. The wagyu gyoza and ceviche scallop were great too! We also shared a robata plate: poussin, which was tender chicken in a teriyaki sauce.. yum! Dessert was a highlight, we got the chocolate banana cake which was swimming in maple butter, and we ordered the alfajores.  For the fantastic service, premium location, great decor and superb food, the price was surprisingly reasonable (under 200\u00a3 for 2).

Half an hour later we were still waiting for the waiter to come and take our order and had not even been asked if we wanted to order some drinks (this is a particular problem when you\u2019ve been given a strict 2 hour time slot for your table).

The service and food in the restaurant was really good. The fusion food [we only had the vegetarian food] was full of flavour and presented very well. The dinner was a bit on the pricey side [not fine dining, but more than mid-range], but the atmosphere and food experience was worth it.

On reception we were told we could go into the garden area to have cocktails/ drinks etc which, we thought, would add to the surprise for my son as views were spectacular!! However, sadly we were greeted by 2 very frosty outside bar staff who informed us that there was no bar menu outside nor would they organise cocktails..... just beers and wine! (A completely different reception and story to the bar staff inside). Non the less we continued in high spirits and ensured we were back inside for our table at 21.15. After 5 attempts to get information from the lady at restaurant reception ( and made to feel in the way while waiting in bar area) we were finally shown to our table at 21.50 by a rather embarrassed maitre d who had been unaware of our situation. Fortunately the evening redeemed itself as the waitress at the table was delightful and food delicious. While I understand that Sushi Samba is a restaurant that Is in high demand ATM it saddens me that the elitist attitude of the outside bar staff and the lackadaisical attitude of the restaurant reception staff somewhat dampened what was supposed to be a wonderful celebratory ( costly) evening for us!

I visited again after one week of my first visit, when I first was there I was very casual dressed and I did notice that everyone else was very fancy dressed therefor I decided to wear a dress the second time I visited, as I have a bad back I could not wear high heels and therefor decided to wear it with sneakers. Once we arrived we got greeted by a very rude guy at the entrance, he ask us several times if we had a reservation and after I agreed he told me that I should have checked the email. I said I did not receive an email, so he told me to read the email, I responded that I did not get an email, after 5 min I found the email in the spam and I read it. He was like did you not even bother to dress according to the dress code, I told him that I did not understand as I was wearing a skirt and a v-neck blouse. Another 5 minutes went by where he was just ignoring me until he told me that I could not get in as I was wearing sneakers (the same I wore the week before). Listen, I do understand that a client has to dress according to the dress code and if the guy would had told me friendly that unfortunately he can't let me in due to my shoes I would have understood- but this guy was so rude that I have to give this business 1 star.

The door men were incredibly rude. We visited on the 26/10/17 and the men on the door were poor judge of character and homophobic and sexist. The men they let in before us in the queue that were allowed in wee even surprised that we were not allowed in as they agreed that they were clearly drunk and we were not. Again we asked the men at the doors why we weren\u2019t allowed entry ways and they were lost for words and couldn\u2019t respond to our query of not being allowed in and could not explain to us why we weren\u2019t allowed entry after I had told them that I hadn\u2019t had a sip of alcohol. I am disgusted at how they treated us tonight, especially how they have let us in previously when one of us was parallactic, but miraculously was allowed in escorted by a male... this makes me believe that sushi samba is homophobic and I do not think that is ok at this day and age. I think it is beyond old fashioned and you should be ashamed in yourselves. You have missed out on valueable customers and I assure we will not be revisiting and I will be sure to tell everyone I know that sushi samba is rude and disrespectful and unprofessional. I would like to reiterate the fact that I am appalled at your customer service and I think as we are in the 21st century I feel as if you should be ashamed of our denial of entry as we could have been valueable customers who were willing to spend a large amount of money of which you have missed out on.", "date_of_review": "26 October 2017"}

The hostesses were not the most helpful, and we had to ask several times to be shown to our table, they just kept looking confused. Once seated though the wait staff were well trained and very helpful with choosing dishes off the menu, and everything we ate was deliciously tasty and beautifully presented.

The view is great but you can just go for a drink at the bar and take a few pics if you want a view. ", "date_of_review": "28 September 2017"}

Multiple emails to Sushi Samba continue to be bounced back when trying to get their thoughts on this. Submission through their web contact form goes ignored. They obviously don\u2019t want to hear feedback. The location is impressive. The food is lovely \u2013 even if so very expensive. But the security staff were the problem.  Getting in was fine. We had a reservation for dinner so front staff just checked the name and sent us in. If you don\u2019t have a reservation I suspect you are running the gauntlet of whether they like you are not. Some other reviews on this site hint at that.  We had a drink at the bar waiting for our table. This was delayed so we were kept waiting in the bar for 20 mins or so, which wasn\u2019t a big problem. Atmosphere in the restaurant was great. Waiters were very attentive. Food was lovely. Expect to pay for this experience though \u2013 it isn\u2019t cheap. A couple of bottles of their cheaper wine plus food for 4 meant a \u00a3500+ bill. So to the main problem. We left the restaurant and headed to the bar. Its there where we were chatting and laughing that the security guard came over and told us to quieten down. Apparently with people eating around the sushi bar we could be disturbing them. This in a bar with pretty loud music! We weren\u2019t going to stay after that so finished our drinks before leaving. Before going we found another security guard. We asked to speak to the manager. He said he was the manager (although I am pretty sure he wasn\u2019t). We explained the situation and that the other security staff\u2019s rudeness. He said he would look for the other security staff member and asked for a description. He then left us and never came back. The staff attitude pretty much spoilt the evening. You spend so much cash in a place and have a nice meal then get spoken to like naughty schoolchildren. It feels like this place is trying a little too desperately to stay a cool place to be.  Ive been there a couple of times but won\u2019t go back now. Very disappointed in not only the attitude of the staff but also the inability to feedback via their email addresses (multiple emails bounced back) or the ignoring of my comments through their web site. If you want to pay for a lovely location and some great food \u2013 then fill your boots. But don\u2019t expect a great customer experience \u2013 and keep your voice down to avoid a trip to the naughty step.", "date_of_review": "4 October 2017"}

You can sit outside in the smoking area, it is a large area again with views over the city. Although it was very windy and chilly, they provide blankets for you to use should you wish to sit outside.

My overall experience at Sushi Samba was undeniably very poor and as a result am a highly satisfied customer for the following reasons: 1. - Upon arrival with my 10 guests I was immediately told the table was the only size they could offer. We initially booked for 8 people and then increased the number to 10 in advance of the visit. However when we arrived the table was only dressed for 8. There was loads of awkward shuffling, however we all got in but we couldn't move it was so tight. One of the waiters then suggested that the \"bigger men step out and the slimmer women replace their seats on the inner side of the table\". From all my experiences of restaurant dining i have NEVER had to take into consideration the size/figure/shape of my guests would be fit for purpose. My guests felt body shamed and offended. 2. - The temperature of the restaurant was so hot and was uncomfortable for us all, particularly because everyone's knees were tightly locked in and causing friction and heat under the table. 3. - The food is nice a lot of options available but our waiter was impatient and just rude. He spilt water pouring our drinks. When it came to ordering he decided he would choose what we should have for dinner. We agreed reluctantly as he really insisted. However when we asked to review his choices he got very agitated and stroppy. He read out the options so quick we couldn't understand what we we're going to eat so every dish that came out was a surprise order. 4. - Our bill came up to about \u00a3600 including a \u00a360 service charge. I was annoyed that we had to pay so much service with a complete lack of service. The views are beautiful but service is absolutely terrible. We we're greeted nicely upon arrival. But no one wished me a happy birthday and we weren't thanked for joining them and no one said bye on the way out. As we were leaving the building the manager demanded another \u00a38.75 gets paid as they failed to calculate the total payments made and put us in an embarrassing position. Terrible!!! Terrible!!!!

It was full (you need to book well in advance) and you feel you are somewhere special. The food is an unusual combination of South American and Japanese with good vegetarian options. We had 3 small plates each following some good advice from our very helpful waiter. All of them were delicious and unusual. Firstly the vegetable and the lobster taquitos, then the corn and tuna seviche and finally the Teriyaki Poussin and the aubergine dish. We finished with the very complex and indulgent 'rainforest' chocolate desert and the moochi which are Japanese rice-cakes filled with ice cream. The portions are not huge but we had the right amount for us. There is a wide range of cocktails and wines and a huge Sake list. There is not much under \u00a350 on the wine list.  It has to be said that this is not a cheap place to eat, if you went big on sushi or went anywhere near the Kobe beef the bill could be huge. We paid \u00a3160 for 2 with wine but overall still thought it was good value for the location food, service and the overall experience.", "date_of_review": "5 September 2017"}

It all starts with the ride up in the elevator to the restaurant. After passing security you enter the elevator which has an open view to the city as you rise 38 stories to the restaurant in about 25 seconds. After exiting the elevator you walk down a narrow hallway which opens up into an amazing lounge/bar area. Continuing through the lounge area you'll walk down another narrow passageway which leads to the main dining area. The decor was awesome and modern.The dining area looks like it can hold about 120 people comfortable. If your party is small enough (2 maybe 3 or less) there's seating along the window on the far end of the restaurant that appears to have a great view of London. There's also 2 outdoor areas, 1 leading to an open deck which appears to be dedicated to large parties (ie. 50 people or more) and another outdoor area with a bar surrounding an orange colored tree. Getting to the meals, we were very very happy with our choices of CORAZ\u00d3N DE POLLO, POUSSIN, LAMB CHOP, SALT AND PEPPER SQUID, and HAMACHI KAMA. As I'm writing this I'm checking availability of locations in the states. It was just that good that either we head back to London or fly to another state. When it comes to drinks I'm an addict for a good Old Fashioned. Sushisamba has a drink on the menu that's a twist on an Old Fashioned and I was very very pleased. All of the food came in a timely manner and the drinks were great. The staff was very good at explaining the menu and how the process went. We had a great time and look forward to our next experience with Sushisamba whether it be London or here in the US. I hope the US can uphold London standards!!!!", "date_of_review": "7 September 2017"}

Our first cocktails were pretty average, especially for \u00a315, and we would have left then except we noticed that the indoor cocktail menu was much larger. We all found our favourites and agreed that the second round was worth it, especially as a few seats near the window opened up. Amazing view.

It was twilight when we got there on a relatively quiet Monday evening. We found some seats overlooking the Gherkin and lots of London sights. Most amazing is the outside bar where the tree is with glowing orange fairy lights and all around are glowing calor gas lights which give a lovely warm glow.

This is definitely not traditional sushi and Japanese cuisine so don't expect chicken teriyaki maki rolls. The food is delectable, finely plated, beautiful dishes with exquisite flavours. Definitely not low-end from a price perspective but well worth it if you appreciate exciting cuisine. Situated on the 38th floor gives diners a great view of London.

We sat outside which was really lovely, however a lot of the bench we were sitting on was quite sticky (to the point where it actually marked my cousins trousers) and there were a lot of small bugs flying around which was a bit disappointing as it just made it all seem very unclean. We only sat there for about 5 mins and luckily a small group left a different table so we were able to move so that was better. In spite of this, the bar staff are all incredibly friendly and helpful and the cocktails are delicious and very well presented. I had a Chucumber (please excuse the spelling if i got that wrong) which I would highly recommend.  Yes, the prices are on the top end of the scale for London cocktails but the views are beautiful and the drinks, staff and decor is all very nice.  All in all it is a lovely place which I will still look to go back to one day, but i do think that just a little bit of attention to detail needs to take place with the outside space (just having a quick wipe down of the table isn't enough of a clean in my opinion), but we still had a really lovely time on her birthday", "date_of_review": "14 August 2017"}

We were seated at our table and explained the menu and the specials. Some of us wanted the specials but wasnt allowed it unless we all had it which i found a little od so we decided to order off the normal menu. It was uncomfortably hot in the resturant so we asked if it was possible to turn the aircon on to which the waiter said i doubt it.

We passed through the security area and went up in the lift. We entered what we later realised was the bar area. We waited with several other people at the entrance of the room, looking a bit confused in regards to whether we should just walk in or wait to be approached by a member of staff.  Feeling awkward we looked around for some sort of acknowledgement or assistance from the staff. No such luck. Several of us commented that none of the staff looked happy. Not one of them would even make eye contact. Finally someone at the front spotted the Maitre 'd Stand on the opposite side of the room. Once they had finished we went over to the Two somber looking ladies stood behind the stand. We explained we had reservation for a party of 7. They took our name, Once again, very little eye contact and no smile whatsoever. As we were waiting for the rest of our party to arrive (parking the car) we were instructed to have a drink at the bar while we waited. Finally everyone had arrived and we went back to the Two somber ladies behind the stand, we were instructed to go into the next room,(dining room) where we were approached by smiling, happier staff. Our waiter Lazlo introduced himself as he escorted us to out table. Finally, it all seemed to be coming together. We ordered an assortment of food, drinks and cocktails which all tasted nice.  It was an overcast day with the occasional rain showers, We were sat in the middle of the room, so the views became redundant. Looking around what was apparent was that the staff would smile and have a friendly chat but as soon as they turned away from the person and people at the table the smile disappeared quickly... We had read your reviews before coming and all i can say is, Sushisamba you're not as good as you think you are. I was left unimpressed and deflated from my experience, especially from your staff.  Just a reminder,\" You're as good as your guest think you are\" and \"You're not doing customers a favour by opening a restaurant, customers are doing you a favour by eating in your restaurant\". Will i return, the answer is a simply no. There are now plenty of restaurants that provide amazing food, friendly service with a smile and great views.

Once seated, the waiter advised us the \"fryer is not working\" so basically things like tempura and fried items weren't available. This combined with the fact I don't eat beef, left us with limited choices. I feel for a restaurant of this standard, the fryer not working in inexcusable as it forces the customer to order items they wouldn't necessarily order. Obviously to get a booking due to the popularity of this restaurant is difficult so it would be silly to walk out. However, the cocktails ordered were delicious and the samba rolls/large plate we ordered were tasty and nicely presented (large plate was a mushroom dish which was a tad salty).

A fair representation of the type of Japanese food you see in places like Sao Paulo with its big ethnic Japanese population from the early 1900's; but at slightly different prices.

The main restaurant is smaller than I expected and the views don't compare to Aqua Shard. However, the food was lovely. The Moqueca Mista was amazing, large plate which myself and friend shared. The fish was plentiful and there was lots of it. We shared 3 small plates, 1 large plate, 1 samba London roll (delicious - 8 pieces) and a cocktail each, bottle of still water the total price incl service charge was \u00a368 each, which we felt was reasonable. Having said that when we left we were very full. Service was excellent, very good. The service in the bar was incredibly slow, at times the barman looked as though he didn't realise there was a queue for 4 people waiting. I've had better bar service at TGI Fridays and without the service charge. The dress code is confusing, we made an effort but lots of people didn't. We saw ladies with open toe sandals (not flip flops though), a couple of people with ripped jeans (the website says this is a no no) and those dressed super casual. Our table was 5.30pm so I don't know if they are stricter later in the evening but its disappointing to dress up when not many others do the same.  We had the table until 7.30pm but were given the bill at 6.50pm. We didn't ask for it so I felt this was rude. It also made my friend feel as though we should pay and go. I told her we had our table until 7.30 and we were staying!. We left around 7.25pm but this spoilt it a little. Anyway, all in all a lovely time. I would go again but would go later in the evening. We booked 2 months ahead and 5.30 was the only time we could get. Give it a try and enjoy the lift which was fun.", "date_of_review": "23 July 2017"}

Bright fresh so well seasoned. The view was amazing outside as well, although it did get chilly and they ran out of blankets for guests. We did ask when one came free if they could bring it over but hey did not and instead gave them to guests who just arrived which was a bit frustrating. We waited a long time for the wine to arrive, I like to have my wine before my food starts to arrive but this did not happen. We also had to constantly ask to have our drinks topped up as the wine was too far away to pour ourselves and our glasses were always empty. I am glad they did not try to turn the table over (We have a 715) booking as the service was pretty slow and it took ages to get our bill asking three different servers.  All in all it was a good experience however it they were looking to move us in 2 hours, I can see how that would not have worked well.

The small plates were amazing, especially the Kobe English breakfast, lobster taquitos and the chicken Robata. I can't say enough.  - staff were friendly, helpful. Our waitress wasn't the best I've ever had to be honest, but others around were good and she was fine.  - the cocktails were great, there are 3-4 bars.  - it's a bit on the \"be seen\" crowd - in that there were lots of very well dressed people here! Not a bad thing, but as the evening went on it got to be a younger /more money crowd I think. Doesn't put me off, but this isn't a low key venue.  - prices, well it's not cheap but everything is on their website. So look first.  - there is some great out door seating if the weather is good. Stunning - NOTE for weekend evenings you need to book 2 months in advance. On the day, 2 months before. Otherwise little chance.  - the elevators/lifts in and out took 5-10 mins. Bare in mind.

We started off on the outside terrace bar where we each had a cocktail - mine being a beautiful smoked negroni.  Then was offered a table outside but chose to eat in due to the wind. We were served by a waitress that gave us amazing recommendations; we had the prawn tempura (best we've ever tasted), pork and veggie rolls, black cod and salmon sashimi (also delicious). Neringa then took over and was amazing!!!!

I have to say as you enter the reception and handling of clientele is quite poor. We were seated near the bar area a good 15 minutes before anyone asked for our drinks. Also the bar outside looked functioning but doesn't serve so you have to sit inside to have a drink before your table is ready.  The flight up to the restaurant gives it some oomf but once you're in the restaurant there is nothing so special it's more like a canteen than a dining place. The service is not that efficient had to ask several times to remove the finished edamame.  Once our waiter Manuel took the order things seemed more serious and the food was really good I have to admit.  It's not my favourite restaurant and I don't think I'll make the effort again in the near future. They should train their waiters as their mannerism is more like canteen than dining.

One cannot fault the service or the effort to make us feel welcome...especially Alvaro who was charming.  The food, however was truly, truly substandard. Perhaps we ordered the wrong things. Everything was so over seasoned or under seasoned. There was no balance. Salt and pepper squid was totally tasteless and had a powdery texture like it was made earlier in the evening and re-heated as was the rock shrimp tempura...both soggy and beyond tasteless. The only redeeming part of the dish was the incredible black truffle vinaigrette. The spicy mayo, also tasteless.  The scallop ceviche was so spicy that aside from the sauce, one could not taste any hint of scallop. One cannot overpower something as delicate as scallops.  We also went a little off piste with a dish recommended to us which was yucca chips on a bed of sweet potato, spicy mayo (I think) all covered in crushed black sesame seeds to make the dish look like earth with molten lava. Whilst the dish looked interesting, it was terribly sweet to the point of putting us off anything else, especially pudding.  I have to say the sushi looked better so perhaps one sticks to rolls at this restaurant.  The other rather disappointing thing was, food waste. For the sake of presentation, when the chefs in the open kitchens cut the maki rolls, they cut off the uneven end pieces and throw them in the bin. With so many restaurants now regularly giving food at the end of the day to homeless shelters, imagine the amount of 'end bits' which add up in an evening. Discarding food like this is a disgrace and a blatant ignorance for those who go hungry.

This time I ate for the first time in the restaurant, the starters of edamame, green beans tempura where nice, the salt and pepper squid and prawn tempura where a let down flavour wise. We ordered about 6 different sushi rolls on recommendation of the waiter. Unfortunately these were bland and not upto expectation of SushiSamba. I really hoped it would set the standard high for London. However after being to many places in London for sushi, this is probably the worst for sushi! On top of that, service was a bit slow, only at the end of our meal did a manager come over to ask about our food, no waiter came before to check on if all was satisfying. We spoke with the manager who kindly took off some of the dishes as we didnt finish them.

We had it all: the edamame, yellowtail taquitos, samba salad,tuna ceviche, the robata chicken...all so good. But then came the sushi rolls. We ordered the Samba London and Tiger Maki rolls. My husband and I basically relied on the expertise of our spunky server, as we were hesitant to order something a little too out there (I mean, how does one mix Peruvian and sushi flavors together?). OMG...it can be done! Especially the Tiger Maki...I wish we had ordered more than one. And if that wasn't enough, our spunky server *highly recommended* the chocolate banana cake. We had our two kids with us (ages 5 & 7), who we literally had to fight with to get bites...it was beyond spectacular. To add, the restaurant was great with our kids: they had the kiddie chopsticks and were super friendly with them throughout. Let's not forget how absolutely cool this place is in terms of the views (38th & 39th floors), floor to ceiling windows, amazing vaulted ceiling design.

From the moment we arrived it was unfortunately glaringly obvious that this is not a restaurant that copes well with bookings for more than 4 people in a party.  This was most disappointing as (when you book 3 months in advance!) they lead you to believe that they are geared up for such events (in our case a birthday dinner for 10.)  Having complied with requests to select cocktails, wine and menu choices before the evening, some of this information unfortunately was not passed on, leaving guests waiting in the bar without pre ordered drinks and seemingly no staff knowledge of the booking.  While the food was delicious, it was presented in such a way that made it unnecessarily complicated and a little awkward to divide between guests to serve ourselves, which was the expectation. This idea would well for a couple but not for a group of 10. The claim that vegetarians etc are catered for is technically correct, however while again this food was delicious (apparently) there was no clear explanation of what was presented.  Frankly a most disappointing evening, high in cost and low on attention to detail. Half hearted attempts were made to compensate for the many complaints but I fear the underlying problems will not be addressed, it matters not, we will not be returning to find out! Our evening was, sadly, best summarised when, after a shocking attack on London's streets last night and with the understandable transport chaos in the aftermath, diners were forced to leave the establishment. It was obviously far more important for the staff to be able to leave on time than to allow customers to secure transport options.  An overhyped, overpriced money making machine which has little regard for those greasing the wheels. Avoid except for couples who want an expensive dinner with a view but wouldn't mind being asked to leave in an emergency with no regard for personal safety.  Restaurants like this simply do not merit the necessity to book 3 months in advance. Frankly it's surprising that anyone bothers to go at all, although the view is good, visit the Shard/Eye/take a flight out of City airport to avoid the disappointment.

I'm not a great sushi lover however but the sushi I tried at the restaurant was lovely. There wasn't anything I did not like. For desserts we choice a mixture and the rain forest dessert was absolutely scrumptious! Many cocktails were enjoyed that luncheon and for me the long mango cocktail was divine. It's a long cocktail and quite creamy with coconut milk. It was incredible. In fact all the cocktails were perfect. Just one word of warning, there is a smokey whisky cocktail and yes it is SMOKEY! Lovely if you like that but wow it's peaty! The service we had that day was perfect. So friendly and polite and courteous. Nothing was any trouble and it really made the meal all the more special because of that.

We visited on a Thursday slightly after peak lunch time and it was busy enough to have an atmosphere, but quiet enough that we had the balcony and fire pit to ourselves for our pre-dinner drinks! Food was, as always, outstanding. The yellowtail crispy taquitos was a dish I hadn't tried before and god knows why, as they were sensational. Yet again the moqueca mista and El topo samba rolls were to die for. In my opinion, the best fusion food in London. We gave our waiter our budget, the dishes we definitely wanted and then asked them to send out their best. The chef did not disappoint. Cannot recommend this place highly enough.

I was with my parents so they didnt really fancy standing in a crowded bar for a drink so we left.  Quicker service would have allowed us to enjoy the table a bit more without wasting pretty much our first hour waiting for our drinks and food to still arrive.

I attended here on the last Saturday of April. I had booked a table for 15:00 for two and thought it would be a fitting location for a date.  I had been told by many friends before visiting that it really is a special place, rather expensive but very nice. And they weren't wrong.  You enter the restaurant by what must be one of the fastest lifts in the world, and it is a spectacular view as you rocket up to the 38th floor. The entrance isn't much of a mouth opener, but once you hit the bar area, you soon see why it is quite something. The tree in the outside terrace is something of a lasting memory.  We were taken to our table which was situated with the amazing view beside us. Waiters and Waitresses attending to our requests for table water and drinks, and we did seek assistance with the menu. How much to order, what would go with what etc. Don't feel ashamed for asking for assistance, we had a couple sat next to us that clearly believed that they had won the lottery and ordered the vast majority of the menu, and the Waitress had to politely explain that they had ordered far too much. This be the problem with uneducated people who have more money than sense.  Moving on, we ordered as you will see from the photographs below, a selection of dishes and an assortment of sushi rolls which unfortunately I did not manage to snap. Please see the description next to them to understand what they are. My favourite dish had to be the Shrimp Tempura. I also absolutely loved the squid, but I found that the soya sauce that accompanied them was a tad salty. You must also select a dessert as they are too rather impressive.  The service was excellent, could have been a tad more personable, particularly as what looked to be the manager takes your payment of a vast amount of money and doesn't even bother to look as you as he punches into his little computer the amount of zero's are on your bill.  All this being said, as as much as I have nit-picked, I would strongly recommend this place, yes it is ridiculously expensive for what you actually get and you could have far nicer food on ground level, but it is about the experience and feeling a little special.  My recommendations are, (1) Visit when it is night time, this for me was one of the regrets having attended in the afternoon. (2) Don't get drawn in by the sugar daddies, or gold-diggers that seem to dine here. (3) Attend with an open mind and enjoy, don't worry about the cost, you only live once, and to be able to say you have dined there is well worth it.", "date_of_review": "30 April 2017"}

While the setting is excellent and the views over London are fantastic, our experience was ruined by rude, ignorant, pretentious and lazy bar staff.  The bar was not busy as we arrived early in the evening, yet the bartender still couldn't offer any eye contact while taking my order. I had to assume his grunt in my general direction was his invitation for me to say the cocktails we wanted. He then tried play it cool and literally fumbled his way through twirling shot glasses and alcohol bottles - dropping them as he went. I was disappointed that one of the cocktails was already pre-made and all he did was uncork a bottle, pour a measure and swirl around some ice with it. After all this, there was still the nerve to add 12.5% service charge.  Afterwards, our friends waited more than 20 minutes for their drinks - despite being the only people queuing for the first 15 of them. The bar staff were more interested in chatting with friends who'd just arrived to the bar and speaking in Spanish (clearly their preferred language) to other Spanish-speaking customers.  Yes, the location is cool and the outside section has a beautiful big orange tree.

After being checked in at the street level entrance we were whisked up to the 39th floor in a glass elevator offering a terrific view of the city. Upon exiting the elevator we walked through a stylistic \u201cgateway\u201d entry to the hostess area. The city view overtakes you as you enter the upper bar and becomes more focal as you descend the steps to the lower bar and restaurant. The dining room itself is a perfectly proportioned setting with floor to ceiling windows on three sides. There are only tables for two along the windows, which affords the diners at the more interior larger tables a breath taking view. Extremely well done. The reason for the detailed description is that the Wow! factor makes dining here truly special.  The service was easy and professional. The plates arrived without undue delay creating a comfortable pace for the meal. I will say that once our dessert and coffee were near finished I definitely felt that it was time for us to leave. That is fine. We had an early reservation and were there for almost two hours . No big deal. The food was delicious. Although we opted to forego the \u00a31,000 steak so we could pay rent, the more reasonably priced dishes were fantastic. We had a Kobe slider, tuna seviche, wagyu gyoza, lamb chop, London roll, El Toro roll, teriyaki poussin, and the alfajores for dessert. All was delish. The wagyu gyoza was exceptional. The sake selection was more that ample. All of this comes at a price. Our bill came to about \u00a3300, all in. But really, for the three of us in such a great setting, I would say it was worth it.", "date_of_review": "17 April 2017"}

The venue itself is great! super luxurious with outstanding views - but at the same time does not feel stuffy or pretentious. We spent quite a lot of time in the bar after the lunch and the drinks were great - the cocktail list is impressive and yes its not the cheapest, but made up for with incredible views and very well made drinks.

Credit card behind the bar and they transfer the bar bill to the table when you sit down. Our waiter was Salvador and water and drinks, wine etc.. arrived quickly and then we studied the menu. We were a party of 8 and choosing and getting a good mix was clearly going to be quite a feat. Salvador stepped in and suggested that he would organise a mixture of first, second and third (main) courses and despite considerable scepticism everyone agreed this would be worth letting him do exactly that. There were one or two special requests to be included, and one non-fish eater needed to be considered. Salvador took that is his stride and it worked very well. He ordered an excellent range of different things each and every one a credit to his choices and to the chefs for a very high standard in each and every dish.  I can not only praise him for his consideration of everyone's requests but in judging it exactly right and not one person was anything other than extremely impressed.  An excellent evening, certainly not cheap, but not expensive either if you take into account the quality. You get what you pay for and nobody can object to that. One small word of advice, if you can avoid an early evening table facing west then do, as the sun was in some of our eyes for some of the time, but that didn't take away from the occasion or the overall enjoyment.", "date_of_review": "7 April 2017"}

Nevertheless, being that high and having this view keeps you busy every second before during and after dinner. We went for lunch and I highly recommend this as all details of the city are clear.

The restaurant and especially the bar area looked way more busy than last time. We got taken to our table, which was not exactly what we wanted. Knowing how difficult it is to book a table at this restaurant we had booked exactly 2 months in advance at 4am, and requested a table with both of us facing the window, as we had the last time we went there. We ended up on a small table in a corner, with our neighbors pretty close to us, and it did feel pretty cramped. One of the nice table (exactly the one we had requested) became available minutes after we arrived, and we therefore asked if we could move. We got told in a fairly rude way that that table had been requested for... We did as well, so I don't know how you do to book one of those tables ?! The food was as last time amazing, especially the Shrimp Tempura and the Churrasco Rio Grande. Only thing is that it seems to us as if the portions had shrank since our last visit, even though the prices remained the same... Cocktails are very good, would definitely recommend trying them out ! Our waiter was very friendly, but was not very attentive. 4 out of our 5 meals arrived within 5 minutes of each others, and we then had to wait 40 minutes for the last one... Not the best of service for such a restaurant ! On our way out, my other half wanted to take a picture at the beginning of the stairss with the view, and after asking the receptionist he said we were not able, someone had apparently \"paid for those stairs\" for the evening... It was the same last time with a private event being held. After paying about \u00a3200 for a dinner, I think allowing us to take a picture in the stairs would have been nice, or at least explaining to us nicely instead of being just rude.  As I said previously the bar area was packed, and no way to seat anywhere to finish our cocktails. Even though the food was amazing once again, I think SUSHISAMBA is becoming a victim of it's own success. For the prices paid at this restaurant, the level of service is well below what's to be expected. Unfortunately following our recent experience I would not recommend this restaurant anymore, as for the same price you can get a much better service and similar food quality elsewhere ! SUSHISAMBA, you just lost customers !", "date_of_review": "29 March 2017"}

I have been to Sushisamba many years ago with my friend for my birthday and had a much more positive experience.

We experienced a variety of dishes as it was our first time, the one dish we were not too keen on was the 'Tuna Ceviche', beautiful chunks of tuna but the marinade was a bit too much for the dish.  The service is great but they do want you to keep the table for under 2 hours so when time is nearing the end, they get a bit pushy - but it is understandable as this place is very popular.

Rubbish service.", "comment": "Waited in a pointless queue on the street... red rope clearly there to add some theatre and exclusivity.  Get into lift... this is awesome. Super fast and city views were brilliant. We find our friends, say hi and dump our stuff. Sitting area we all had reserved was a small low table with little stools next to the stairs with lots of waiters walking past with sometimes very hot food. Felt like we were in the way a bit. Go to the bar to get a drink. \u00a330 for too cocktails. Now I get we are in London in a prime location but that is expensive but also expected. What wasn't expected was the 20 minute wait to be served. The bar wasn't busy, don't know why it took so long. Cocktails were tasty. Next time we get a drink we decide on a bottle of champagne. \u00a375. When we get the receipt we have been charged something like 12% service charge. SERVICE CHARGE!?!? For waiting to be served another 15 minutes and barman bending over getting a bottle out the fridge? I don't think so! Outrageous! Service charges are ok if we actually get served quickly and at our table? But neither of that happened! I asked them to take the service charge off and I got major attitude from the hipster barman. He took it off and then threw the card machine at me. He then started serving someone else. So I was left to pull the receipts out myself.  My sister got the next bottle, the bar lady persuaded her to keep the service charge on saying something like they get paid like in America and only get paid via the service charge... LIES!!!! We are in ENGLAND! I'm pretty sure there are laws about minimum wage! Stupid! So next time I get a drink served by the same lady as my sister and I refused to pay the service charge. She spent about what felt like 10minutes trying to persuade me why I should pay it... and the end I just said to her I didn't want to know and I just wanted to pay.  Meantime one of the girls in the group ordered some sushi to the tiny table (which by the way was very full of empties) literally took an hour and half to bring 3 plates at least 20 minutes apart. Absolutely ridiculous. We had to chase them up twice. By this point I locate a waiter and ask to speak to a manger. Totally rude and unapologetic. I felt like I was talking to the \"ringleader\" of the mean and rude crowd at school. He didn't care about our issue. Got no apology and got told that's just the way it is. Last bit of the food came around 1 and half hours after it was ordered. I only had one sushi roll, it was nice. Bit of an anti climax though after such a long wait. So basically go here if you like rude staff, terrible service and nice views. I won't ever go back. The only reason why we stayed there at all was it was a friends birthday and didn't want to create drama for her... any other time I wouldn't waste my hard earned cash.", "date_of_review": "25 February 2017"}

Love authentic Japanese food (basically Japanese food in Japan), but something about Japanese x Brazilian x Peruvian fusion food just never sounded particularly appetizing or interesting to me. In fact, it sounded pretty risky to me as the potential for major disappointment was quite high. Thus, I have been putting off trying the place for the last 7 years, but this Valentine\u2019s Day 2017, it was finally time to man-up and my wife and I went to check out the place out for ourselves. Overall Summary Style & atmosphere : Sushi Samba is located on the 38th and 39th floors of Heron Tower, the same tower that houses Duck & Waffle on the 40th floor, and similarly to Duck & Waffle, offers a breath-taking 360 degrees view of London City. The main dining room felt a little small for me compared to Duck & Waffle, but it had a nice intimate and relaxed vibe to the place. Didn\u2019t find the ambiance pretentious or stuffy, which was good. However, despite saying all that, the ambiance took a knock when the cleaner came out with a broom and cleaning signboard halfway through our service and started sweeping up in the main dining room. I found this quite odd as there wasn\u2019t an immediate need to clean up due to any spillages or accidents. Up to until we paid our bill, she was constantly in-and-out of the main dining room sweeping around and it wasn\u2019t discretely done either as she was cleaning around quite near the tables that had guests dining on them. It just wasn\u2019t a good look to have. I checked some of the other guests\u2019 reaction and from the way they were shooting eye-darts with one another when the cleaner appeared, they seemed just as perplexed by the situation as I was.  Food : 6.8/10. The Valentine\u2019s Day Sharing Menu was \u00a3125 per person, which included a glass of Champagne Brut Ros\u00e9 on arrival, and consisted of:  1. Plantain and Cancha with Aji Amarillo - 6/10. 2. Lobster Tempura with carrot, pumpkin, caviar, tensui emulsion, yuzu gel - 7.8/10. 3. Warm Black Cod Seviche with aji amarillo dashi, huancaina sauce, roasted peruvian potatoes \u2013 5.5/10. 4. Confit Duck Gyoza with raisin, hazelnut, aji amarillo, crispy shallot - 6.5/10.  5. Kagoshima Ribeye with quinoa, mushroom, caramelised onion - 8/10.  6. Samba Roll Selection made up of 4 pieces of Tokyo Sky Tree\u2028(spicy bigeye tuna, tempura crunch, lotus root, aji panca, spicy mayo) \u2013 7.3/10, 8 pieces of Samba London\u2028(crab, tuna, salmon, white fish, prawn, avocado, tempura crunch, rice cracker, japanese pickles, wasabi mayo, aji panca, soy reduction) \u2013 7/10 and 4 pieces of Tiger Maki\u2028Takuwan (wasabi tobiko, crab meat, tempura prawn, tiger prawn, wasabi mayo, beetroot yogurt, soy reduction) \u2013 7.4/10. 7. Alfajores with dulce de leche, coconut, alfajores biscuit, caramel, gold, and black salt \u2013 6/10. The only memorable and tasty dishes were the Lobster Tempura, and the Kagoshima Ribeye. The Samba Roll Selection was decent enough. Everything else, unfortunately, was a little bland for my liking and lacking in flavour. Their drinks are highly noteworthy though. Since we are not fond of Champagne, the member of staff very kindly let us swap them for an Umeshu sake and Yuzu Sake, respectively. Both were delicious. We also ordered a Lychee Cooler and a Shiso Fine and both were divine to drink.  Service : 6.5/10. Basically, their service can be summed up quickly as follows, their friendly staff absolutely try their best to please you, but their execution and inconsistencies lets them down.  There was some incidences that I took a little umbrage to throughout the service which are listed as follows: - The hostess to the main dining room was unwelcoming with an uninterested attitude. - At the time of reservation and also at the time of reconfirming my reservation I asked for a window seat if possible, and was told that although they couldn\u2019t guarantee a window seat, since it was first come first serve, they would try their best. Which is fair enough. However, when we arrived I spotted a couple of window seats empty and asked if we could sit there instead and was told that they were both reserved for guests that would be coming later. What ever happened to the first come first serve? - The table we were given was slightly wobbly, but luckily one of the staff spotted this and very kindly said he would fix it. Ten minutes later, he still had not fixed it despite him looking awfully not busy and free. After asking him again to please kindly fix the table, he again said he would, but another 8 minutes or so goes by and again, still nothing. In the end I gave up and asked a different member of staff who fixed it immediately within 10 seconds. Why the first staff couldn\u2019t do this, or alert someone else to do this, I don\u2019t know. - They forgot to bring out 2 of our dishes which we had to point out to them. They bypassed the Lobster Tempura and Duck Gyoza and went straight on to the Kagoshima Ribeye.  - At the time of reservation and pre-payment for this meal I had asked verbally and reconfirmed by email, whether they could do a birthday dessert plate for my wife since her birthday falls on Valentine\u2019s Day and the staff replied that they usually don\u2019t do birthday dessert plates, but they do arrange for little boxes of macaroons to be given instead. However, since it was going to be Valentine\u2019s Day, I was told they were planning to give each table a little box anyway as a small gift and that he would make a note regarding my wife\u2019s birthday on our reservation. Yup, you guessed it, nothing was given. At the end of our meal, I asked a member of staff about the macaroons and after checking our reservation details he said that no notes were made about my wife\u2019s birthday on it and that unfortunately, since it was Valentine\u2019s Day, they didn\u2019t have any macaroons on hand which didn\u2019t make any sense to me as this was the complete opposite of what I was initially told. To make amends, this member of staff offered us each a complimentary glass of champagne, and whilst the kind gesture was much appreciated I couldn\u2019t help but feel disappointed as this was the same staff that we told not 2 hours earlier that we don\u2019t like champagne and asked whether we could swap our drinks for something else. - After settling the bill, we sat there waiting for 15 minutes for them to bring our change back. In the end it turns out that they had forgotten about our change. Toilet decor & cleanliness : 6/10. The boys\u2019 toilet was small, not very clean and on that night, there was strong whiff of smelly urine. On the contrary, I was told the girls\u2019 toilet was nice and clean with no dodgy smell wafting around. Value for money : 5/10. The Valentine\u2019s Day sharing menu was quite pricey, but unfortunately, the quality and quantity of the food did not warrant the high price. At the end of the meal, I left the restaurant still feeling hungry. The cocktails were worth it though. In my opinion, the order of the sharing menu should have gone like this: start with the Plantain and Cancha, then move onto one Samba Roll Selection dish, but instead of sharing, it should be one Roll Selection dish (it\u2019s only 8 pieces) for each guest, then the Lobster Tempura dish , then the Warm Black Cod Seviche, then the Confit Duck Gyoza, then the Kagoshima Ribeye, followed by the Alfajores dish. Would I go again : Even though I\u2019m curious to see how their normal a la carte menu would fare, I don\u2019t think I will be visiting again for the food. Plenty of other nice Japanese restaurants out there in London to munch on. However, I wouldn\u2019t mind chilling out at their bar again to sip on their delicious cocktails.", "date_of_review": "20 February 2017"}

Finding the entrance is a little tricky as you only see a sign for the Duck & Waffle but, once found, you are lifted up in the escalator to the 38th floor and a view that is it hard to anywhere else, let alone London. Walking into Sushisamba you are greeted with a fairly narrow hallway where the toilets and the cloakroom are located next door - not a favourite of mine but space Is limited I guess. You then come into the bar area which is spacious and opens up onto the terrace where you have another bar and more outstanding views; upon entry into the restaurant one is taken back by the d\u00e9cor\u00e9.   The service throughout was sublime: always attentive and never too much so; all the staff were polite and smiled. However, the food is where this place hits another level. Looking at the menu, if you are not frequent patron of Japanese restaurants, it may look a little daunting but trust me: what ever you order will be amazing. We had a wide variety of the menu between three of us with the stand outs being the Prawn Tempura and the assortment of Sashimi, but everything was brilliant. Drinks are expensive, with wine starting around \u00a335 and, unless you know what you're ordering exactly the need to go above \u00a345 is there, but nothing unreasonable for London. All in all this place is deserves a 9/10, a few things such as the toilet/cloakroom location and the price of wine stop it from getting a 10 however I would always recommend - just book early.", "date_of_review": "24 February 2017"}

I would agree with that, but unfortunately since I was travelling with limited internet I could not arrange the form and credit card information. Nilyay said she spoke with the pastry chef and they would make the surprise anyway, that was really simple, when I asked for the dessert, would come a message: Do you want to be my girlfriend? Nothing complicated apparently, I thought. So on the night everything was ok, the food and the service (beside the fact they only serve food until 23h30 and never mentioned before, only when we were on the table), the drinks also amazing, the view fantastic.  I was able to get out of the table to confirm with the hostess my special request, and she said: \"Don't worry the waitress and the kitchen know about it\". So I went back to the table and guess what happened when I ask for the dessert? They send a message of Happy birthday! Ruining the special moment, of course. I sent them an e-mail on the following Monday and they only contact me on Thursday, quite a long time just to check what happened. Anyway Nilyay called me and apologize on behalf of the restaurant for what happened, saying the waitress got confused and brought another dessert. And that was all!!!! No invitation to come back and have at least a drink, no nothing. They ruin a moment and they say \"I'm sorry, but someone made a mistake\".

I see a common area of complaint from other reviews is service. I agree they could improve this, although I've never experienced anything worse than it feeling slightly disorganised - with far too many different stuff fussing around but not actually doing anything. Not bad enough to downgrade to four star but would love to see them address this.  Ambience consistently great whether a weekend or weekday, late lunch or dinner. Amazing views and if it's your first time then you'll love the trip up in the elevator.  Obviously it's not cheap, realistically it's \u00a380+ per head but its head and shoulders above many other London restaurants charging the same price, in my opinion.

However, finding the right sushi can be a cumbersome experience, leaving you with a bad after taste. Go no further my dear friends- Sushi Samba has to be the 2nd best sushi we\u2019ve ever had. Number one is and will always be Nobu, Park Lane. I will eventually get to writing about Nobu too, so stay tuned as that will be an epic.  Getting a reservation here is not easy, especially as we visited during the first opening week. The restaurant is located between 38th and 39th floor of the Heron Tower in Bishopsgate, a business district of London. (Equivalent to Wall St). The glass capsule lift shoots you up onto the top floor, before you had a chance to take any snaps of the amazing view of London. (Just get your camera\u2019s ready before going into the lift).  We ordered few cocktails to begin with at the bar before getting seated. This was later followed by one of the best sushi in town. The taste and the freshness of each ingredient on the slate plate was too tempting to resist. If you ever visit here, you must try the waguyu mini burgers, am not big on red meat but these little gems were delightful! They are fairly small to say the least, about one bite size, but the taste is just phenomenal. They do say, all good things come in small packages- this is once certain example!  If you have a sweet tooth like mine, then you are in for a treat. The deserts here are just as good as the sushi. Its not very often that you get an amazing main with matching desert, but Sushi Samba does both. As someone who has deserts where ever I go, I know a good treat when I see and taste one. I was left speechless, yes it was that damn good. Their signature \u2018Love from Rio\u2019 desert, is out of this world. I love the fact that there was ice-cream, nuts and chocolate. I mean, what else could a girl ask for.. Our table was just by the window, meaning we had a fair good view out looking onto the city on this clear evening. As the evening drew to an end, we were all stunned upon what we had just discovered and it was ever more epic as we watched the sunset \u2013 a memorable evening, with great food and great company (my husband off course) \u2013 this right here ladies and gentleman is the secret to happiness!", "date_of_review": "5 February 2017"}

The food is good but they have cut down the portions, increased the prices and the waiters were very pushy to rush us to order and get us out. If it wasn't for these things I would have given this place 5/5.  Based upon my most recent experience, me and my friends have decided to move on and find a new regular.

The shrimp tempura, salmon ceviche and the black cod are simply incredible. The moqueca is a delicacy too with a good twist from the Brazilian version.  However, the restaurant dos not give to their staff the 12.5% they charge on top of your bill, clearly not recognising that a great part of their success comes from the good service provided by the people who work there (and basically just charging you 12.5% more on top of the menu's price on everything without a decent reason).  Having worked as a waitress myself when studying at Law School this kind of attitude from restaurant owners affects me deeply, so I will keep on refusing to pay for the service if they do not go to your staff, and give it to them directly if I can.

I love sushi and all the food that comes along with it, but we left the ordering to our waiter, firstly we have the chips to start while we were deciding, then we had a warm sushi with salmon, cheese and other amazing things on it, I have never ever tasted something that bursts with so much flavour and doesn't get to much! Even my boyfriend was absolutely amazed! It was that good that we had another dish before we decided to finish off the meal, the fish and prawns were to die for also!  I'm so sorry I can't remember the waiters name but we were right in the corner to the right of the restaurant on Monday night your waiter deserves serious credit, his choices were amazing and so was his and everyone else's service was beyond fantastic!

I particularly loved the eggplant small dish. Then the main dish of the churrasco rio grande came and it truly was like food heaven!

We had real trouble parking so were 45 mins late but we called the restaurant and they were very understanding. It's not mentioned on the menu but if you set a price they will bring you out a selection based on what you like (I know this from my visit to the Vegas restaurant). They said they did this also and recommended \u00a375 per person. We went with their recommendation and it was perfect. The black cod skewers were particularly memorable.  They set it into 3 sections, tacos, serviche started us off then meat and fish and ended with sushi. We had just the right amount of food without feeling too full. The total bill was \u00a3318, including 12.5% service charge, edamame beans, 3 beers and a cocktail so the set menu must have come in under the \u00a375 per person showing they don't automatically just charge the limit you set. Drinks selection is great, staff told us on arrival we'd need to leave by 7.15 which we were happy to do but in the end it was 7.45 and they offered us dessert but the kids were getting tired so we skipped.

This made us 5 minutes late. Anyway, we reached the top of the restaurant and our jackets were taken. We were still made to wait in the overcrowded bar area and had to wait 20 minutes, despite having made reservations. We were then taken to our seat... it was not by the window as promised. We mentioned this but apparently there was nothing they could do. We ordered nigiri and some other types of sushi rolls and some some sort of prawn and cocktail type dish. The sushi was of a high standard but nothing out of this world. The shrimps or prawns or whatever they were, however, tasted amazing.

But.... Sushi Samba has taken it too far and therefore do NOT represent good value at all. We went for the chefs pre selected menu which is what our waiter recommended and Our meal came to \u00a3150 per head without drinks and neither the Qaulity or Quantity could justify the price point. Big problem guys. Yes There was some ingenuity in the cooking which I appreciate greatly but that on its own cannot justify the price tag. For these sort of prices you can hire the chefs table at dinner with Heston!

It didn't disappoint again. The only negatives I would say was that despite us making a reservation for a specific time we waiting over 30mins to be seated after the designated time, also the waitress whilst helpful wasn't fully informed when faced with questions and I wouldn't say was customer service focused either. Having been there before and after ordering a large quantity of food \u00a3300+ we asked for sides of rice (a dish we were offered and had ate there before), we were told in no uncertain terms we could have it it was apparently for children only and the new chef had changed the concept. The waitress made a bit song and dance about asking the chef as if we had asked for something completely off the menu that they didn't serve. Seeing as rice is one of the main ingredients of sushi and I had ate it before and offered it as a side dish I really didn't see a big issue with a couple of bowls to accompany food, in any case 15mins or more later we were finally told we were allowed to have two. The food as before was extremely good, everyone commented on the flavours and how well everything was presented, cooked and tasted. We ordered Kobe sliders, teriyaki chicken, the large ribeye and chorizo dish, sushi, black cod, the lamb dish, and a pork belly dish that wasn't on the menu. I wouldn't hesitate to return as I love the food and the ambience, it's always busy, there's good music, great drinks and even better food.  The sticky toffee and ice cream birthday dish was also really good, apart from being misled told it was going to be a large chocolate cake as they didn't do small birthday deserts any more apart from a macaroon with a candle.

Once I had a lunch here now we choose to have dinner. Some of my dishes were good but others were more than disappointing!  I chose from the raw section the Tuna and specially asked from the waiter what was that but when it arrived I was more than surprised: there was almost no tuna in my dish at all.  I asked he waiter if he could find any in it and he found 2 pieces of 1x1 cm tuna in this terribly sour, vegetable composition. Then they asked me if I want more tuna in it but till that I ordered another dish: samba rolls which were just ok.  The food wasn't the best but the service is just ridiculous!  Tonns of waiters and waitresses roaming around but when you try to ask anything or pay or you have any request you have to wait long minutes (the place wasn't crowded) and this spoils the whole experience and it's annoying. Once we were waiting at least 5 minutes we saw exactly 6 of the staff just standing behind the counter and doing nothing. With the \u00a31000 beef price they definatelly should watch out more. The decoration is wonderful though especially the tree on the balcony.  I'm not sure if we want to return... if yes then for the view.  Cocktails were great I suggest to have a drink there.

We arrived early at around 8:30 - 8:45PM, after confirming the reservation details we were about the enter the lift when your security staff stopped us and advised us that we would like to check the bag. I thought this is just the usual security thing, not a problem at all. I gladly opened by bag (a backpack). He spotted a plastic bottle drink (about 500ml half empty soft drink), which he mentioned I need to drink it since it's not allowed to bring it upstairs. I thought it's a bit rude but it's not a big deal it can be simply thrown away. I put it on the floor and Sushisamba security guy literally threw the bottle away to the corner around the check in desk area. He pointed the content of my bag, and asking what are those which I replied \"food, groceries\". He asked me again, what kind of food? To be honest I was stunned, I did not expect to be scrutinised about my shopping details. I put my bag on the floor wide open so he can check it himself as much as he wants, I thought. But he asked me again what food? Well I am not sure what I am suppose to do? Does Sushisamba seriously wants me to declare my grocerry shopping list there? Do I need to show him right in front of other guests my packet of steak, broccoli and cheese? This is rather insulting and degrading. Honestly, my blood boiled. I told him he could ask politely instead of repeatedly shouting \"What food? What food? What food\" To which he said \"I did not say that\". Well, yes you did. I don't think I have amnesia. Now to think about it again. Does he seriously think,we're just going to eat our own food there? We put all of our bags and coats in the cloakroom anyway. I have to say, the restaurant service and food are all excellent, as good as the previous occasions even though this will be the last time we will be going to Sushisamba. No restaurant worth the trouble and I can not accept the treatment by your security.

And when it arrived it was all at the same time rather than being staggered. As if they wanted to be rid of us in record time. A \"standard \" service charge ( a tip in any one else's language ) was included in our bill. When we asked for it to be removed due to what we considered to have been pretty ordinary service you would have thought by the reaction we had committed a Capital crime.

I visited this restaurant for a friends birthday and I handled the booking, the process is a tad clunky for a such a good restaurant but still impressive once it's booked, with text message confirmation and e-mail reminders helping you out. On the day, you arrive, don't let first impressions fool you, you need to use a lift to enter the restaurant and the waiting area looks rundown, worn out, has no heating (not particularly good for a cold January day)......but once you step into the lift, everything changes. You rocket up to the 38th floor, and the view, while going up is breathtaking, you're done in about 40 seconds, you're then greeted by a very eager cloakroom helper who shows you through to reception.  The lady running reception during the early evening that day looked stressed and was helpful but I little bit too stressed for a restaurant like this, but I'll put that down to a busy bank holiday and a lot of extra guests.  We were then ushered to our table and the service was superb, totally on point, the menu is a mess though and very confusing, for a foreign visitor (my friends were German) were completely lost, it needs a cleaner layout and much bigger writing as the restaurant is dimly lit for effect. What overrides these minor points, is the constant attention (but never too much just right) the expertise on hand from all the staff, then the description once the food arrives, to how they stagger your menu so you feel like you've had a proper meal. The food was just exquisite, the sushi is on par with anything I've eaten in Japan, lovely prepared and tasted so fresh, the desserts were great, I was little underwhelmed by the ice cream rice cakes which seemed soggy and too frozen but then they served me up the banana chocolate cake which was delightful. The view is something else, and they are totally relaxed on you going \"full-on\" tourist and taking photos from every angle, the venue is decorated well and the tree is a sight to behold. Pictures do not do it justice. When service and food is \"this good\" you tend to forget the niggly bits and my friends were really impressed and that's what mattered on that evening to me. So do go, be prepared to spend some money, the view, great food and gorgeous service come at a price that I'm willing to spend. If you're just going for drinks, get there early, this place (which always is a good sign) is popular.  Let's hope they don't let standards slip, because this is something special and I hope they keep on choosing the experience for their customers instead of money and at the moment they've got it right.", "date_of_review": "3 January 2017"}

Bland tasteless cuts of overcooked meats; miso black cod where the poor fish has been obliterated out of existence by the sauce, the sushi is just a roll of the dice.

The food quality was fantastic and I will highly recommend this to all who I know. However we were very dissatisfied with the food service element. The waiters were not attentive and also had the attitude that they were too good to serve us. They did not explain the dishes properly, showed no interest in making sure we were having a night to remember, and also made us have to ask after all the courses.  One waiter didn't want to explain what he was serving and just decided that a huff and quick departure from our table would suffice.  We are not a fussy group, though we like to spend our hard earned money on quality experiences - we thought that this would be one such an occasion but sadly the serving staff did not agree.  I would recommend this dining experience to my friends because of the food and the view, but if Sushi Samba want to be the premier establishment in London then they need to look at their serving staff.  There are a few saving graces, and we do not want to tar all of the serving staff with the same brush - that said, we would like to see more attention from the management to ensure all guests experience the same exemplary experience.  I do have exact examples that I can share with the management if they so wish to get in touch. For now, in the spirit of Christmas... Merry Christmas  Rhys", "date_of_review": "23 December 2016"}

Firstly I found the service ok, often having to wait for servers to order drinks or if I had a question. If service was a little better, I would have rated excellent. The food on the other hand was superb. Everything was just so delicious. The menu is quite extensive and some guidance is required to ensure you do not order too much or too little. A very special place to go to for special occasions. I would also suggest quite pricey, if you are planning to have some drinks with your meal, but well worth it.

What Sushisamba managed to achieve over the slow course of the year was dashed by dim-wittedness and an appalling lack of initiative on behalf of the hosting staff.   We had arrived to fulfill an 11:30 booking ten minutes late, and after spending another ten minutes being patted down by security we were told that the kitchen had unfortunately closed. A fifteen minute argument later, the chefs handed another sizeable sushi tray to a server mere feet from us.   The table could not be committed, the kitchen had closed, and the hostess' manager parroted the sentiment, apparently unable to understand the idiocy in either taking the booking, or closing the kitchen at 11:45 when the table was granted until 01:30 at night!   A whispered explanation from a sympathetic server explained that the kitchen staff had felt \"tired\" throughout the week and decided to take an early night off.   An appeal for a complimentary drink was similarly scuffed off, so we waited, coats in hand, for a further fifteen minutes while a table was sorted in Duck and Waffle a floor above.

The booking was easy and when we arrived the table was ready. We had a nice person looking after us but, it wasn't enough. Before I start please note that I'm very, very picky so you might think I'm overreacting...well is my money so I'm entitled to. They took our order..a mix of small dishes to share, plantain (very good but VERY small so not worth the price) gyosas.. I can't fault them..really good, green beans, some tempura beans, etc all good but small. Service arrived little by little and drinks arrived after food was served (a huge oversight In the service) they also forgot my drink..and I didnt get it until I had to ask for it..a Pisco sour! A alcohol made in Peru and Chile from grapes, usually 45 degrees alcohol.. To my horror what I received was nothing like a good pisco sour..in fact it was terrible!! So bad that I returned it.. So be aware and don't order it.. They accepted my complaint and replaced it with a tequila margarita. The margarita was well prepared but average. You can have this drink made with the same standard anywhere else.. Ok then I had tuna ceviche ..this dish was very interesting.. The flavours were all there but it was soo small that was difficult to enjoy properly..again I understand the place is trendy and they want us to believe this sharing style..again is definitely too small. If you ever go to latin America ask for a ceviche and you won't be disappointed by the size. I then had some chicken heart skewers..they were delicious..size was good and sauce was a perfect companion..all the flavours were there to enjoy.. For dessert I asked for an alfajor...well what I received was a version of alfajor that was nothing to compare with real alfajores in Latin America... As a conclusion: a complete overpriced experience with average service and pretentious fusion style that often mix and experiment so much that looses the meaning of the dish.. Sad specially as the Latin food mix with Japanese should be a good mix...unfortunately I won't go back.", "date_of_review": "11 December 2016"}

The sushi is good. London might not be known for a total sushi town but Sushisamba is an international org. and it provides great dining experiences for its customers. So, book well in advance, the queue for the elevator at the bottom adds to the excitement. You shoot up 39 floors and arrive. Wow! Spectacular views. The drinks at the bar are seasonal and whoever in charge has a good immagination. When I went with my girlfriend there was a surprisingly organic vegetable twist to the drinks. She had a summer berries and beetroot daquiri and I ordered a kale pina colada... Soo good! We ate a rather expensive but wholesome and delicious meal.

The crab taquitos were another standout for me, and the sushi was incredibly fresh, however we over-ordered and did not get to fully appreciate it.

We were lucky to have a booth table which was one of the best in my view for a larger party. If there were 2 of you you could get tables that looked directly out and next to the large window which I would suggest asking for if there is only 2 of you. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable, one of our guest is pregnant and so unable to eat certain things but they were able to guide us through the menu and select suitable dishes. Everything we ate was beautiful, I couldn't fault it in any way, delicious flavours and just mouth watering. We especially loved the green bean tempura. I would definitely recommend to anyone. The menu and food is expensive but you won't be disappointed. I would suggest booking well in advance as it can be hard to get a table for lunch and dinner (we booked for 2:15 and managed to get booked in 2 weeks in advance) I will definitely be back for the next special occasion.

We have wanted to come here for a long time and finally managed it! On arrival the glass lift takes you up 38 floors, overlooking London as you go. The bar area was rather busy. The upper bar is apparently closed on a Sunday so there were a lot of people trying to find somewhere to stand or sit and enjoy the view. The garden was also closed which made inside even more congested. The very small area you are able to sit at is pretty much under the stairs so you need to be very careful of your head and there are many signs and stickers warning you. We were not greeted by anyone nor did we know if there was a cloakroom, we kinda had to figure it all out ourselves. The bar staff seemed to table serve some guests but not the others. My fianc\u00e9 went to the bar to get more drinks and a waitress came over took his glass and bottle and subsequently took my glass of champagne which has 1/4 still left in it. I preceded to tell her I hadn't finished as she swiped the glass and soaked herself with my champagne that I did not finish. She then put my glass down and told me she would get me some more, that never happened. My fianc\u00e9 came back to the table with no glass just bottles of beer which was also not very good.  Onto trying to find out if our table was ready... we worked our way through the masses to the desk where 3 members of staff were standing. They subsequently told us our table was not ready and to wait by the bar... 15 minutes later we were still waiting so I had to chase up the staff who then said yes our table was ready! It seems no attempt was made to even find us and advise us this was ready.  Once seated we were given the menu and greeted by our waiter who asked if we needed any help with the menu. He was pleasant enough So to the food.... we chose miso soup, shrimp tempura, and the following samba rolls.. samba london, Tokyo sky tree, California maki The food was delicious so fresh and flavoursome The cocktails were just as tasty, my favourite was the Samba Sour although the sambatini and champagne was also delicious. My fianc\u00e9 had the Asian lager.  Overall we had a really nice evening. The staff, in our opinion, need to be a bit more friendly and approachable but the food is undeniably delicious.

I have even recently branched out from just 'me and my partner' visits to dragging my never-tried-sushi-before in laws. They thought the alternative selection to sushi (ie the black cod or tempura shrimp) was excellent and the sushi they tried was superb. Only time service slipped was when there must have bee some sort of breakdown of the booking system and me and my party was left standing for an hour awaiting a table in the bar area.

Highlight mains included the Sea Bass, Tokyo Sky Tree - tuna, tempura crunch, lotus root and spicy mayo and the Samba London Rolls - a great selection of Sushi. Deserts were like pieces of Art and a delicious selection of Passion fruit sorbet with Green Tea gel. We went large and finished with some additional cocktails - try the Cafe Millonari for that desert post-prandial pick me up! Dinner with great friends is the best, on top of the world even better and the universe grace us with a beautiful rainbow! A perfect way to spend a Sunday lunch time.

Then Salvador, who was our main waiter, help us to select a combination of plates and the Ceviche was indeed delicious. the sushi was amazing, the food was presented beautifully. Thank you Salvador, and the glass of champagne for the waiting was very much appreciated. My sister had a Happy Birthday (written in chocolate, obviously) dessert with a candle.

The service is not discreet enough to make you comfortable and you can get stressed by the attention. The food is excellent and the mixture of Japanese, Brazilian, Peruavian is exciting with modern dishes and this works fine as a crossover kitchen.

As we had lived in Tokyo for 3 years and we all love Japanese food we were hoping for a memorable experience. We were disappointed. We ordered the SHOICHI menu (\u00a375pp) and we started with cocktails in the bar. All great so far. The first few courses were all delicious and the sake waiter helped us choose an interesting, slightly sparkling sake which went well with the food. Then just before the sushi course it all unravelled. We had sat down at 1930 and we had enjoyed all the courses up to the sushi and they all arrived at regular intervals up to around 2045. We then had a long wait for the sushi which, I have to say, was rather underwhelming: not much variety, too much salmon and prawn for my liking. Then we had another enormous wait for the desert which finally arrived around 2200. By this time we were more than ready to go home and in fact we'd asked for the bill. However....the dessert was absolutely delicious.

{"review_id": 1518, "restaurant_id": -12, "username": "vreport", "date_of_visit": " November 2016", "rating": "1", "title": "An abysmal service", "comment": "Having been in over 100 5* hotels and another 50 Michelin stared restaurants, I was astonished by the horrid service at Sushi Samba London, considering the fact that they position themselves as a luxury restaurant offering innovative Japanese cuisine of the finest quality. After making an attempt at reserving a table, I was told that since none were available, I could be served at the sushi bar, which was a perfectly viable solution. We (a party of 2) have arrived outside of normal meal time, yet the restaurant operates on a non-stop basis. After having passed the before mentioned sushi bar, which was empty expect for two people, we have arrived at the reception where we were told that the restaurant is fully booked (we ere offered to wait for 1.5-2 hours for a table which was not guaranteed under a pooling rain and a blistering cold, however). We asked about the bar, as we were aware of the fully booked restaurant. As we\u2019ve seen it being empty, we thought that we will be seated immediately, but to our surprise we were told that in fact the bar is no operating at this moment (and that we\u2019d have to also wait for 2 hours for it to open). At the same time, the bar and the tables near it were not just full, but there were people hanging over the heads of patrons, standing and waiting for the tables (some pleasant and relaxing experience there). The stated reason for all of this was the lack of waiters to serve the sushi bar. We could not resist and ask about the two people sitting at the bar and enjoying their meals - \u201cbut who are the two guests eating at the bar if it is closed?\u201d The reply shocked me to the spine - \u201cit\u2019s the mangers\u201d\u2026 So the two managers were eating and chatting about in a very leisurely manner (with the entire army of unseated guests watching them), while half of the floor (sushi bar) was closed due to the lack of personnel and the other half was packed with people who did not know where to stand and how to get a table because the two \u201cladies\u201d at the reception decided that they would not bother themselves with it and just tell the people that they are only in charge of the seating at the main restaurant and that the bar area seats are on first-come-first-served basis. I believe that in such situations, it\u2019s the mangers\u2019 responsibility to make sure all guests are seated and served (especially that there were free places), and that in the case of lack of waiters, they can also serve food and drinks. The situation was beyond absurd, as the managers were eating and chatting between their meals (yes, they were had several services), the hostesses\u2019 also didn\u2019t care - they were fixing their hair (because why not - it\u2019s more important - right?), while the guests, who were watching all of this, were literally pushing each other out of the way to get first to that one tiny table that has just freed up. After having to push around for over 20 minutes, we have managed to \u201csit ourselves\u201d. After having invited the waiter for 4 times, we managed to place an order an were later served in a bizarre fashion, as our order was split into two services in a totally arbitrary manner. Regarding the food: undoubtably, the food was well prepared with ingredients of high quality. The fish was very fresh and the sushi tasted very well. Unfortunately however, the utterly despicable service has besmirched the entire experience and the good food could not fix it. Naturally, none of the personnel took it upon them to apologise or rectify the situation in any way. Inspire of the high quality cuisine, I strongly advise to NEVER visit this venue. Without prejudice or and interested behind, for people looking for high quality and innovative Japanese cuisine, I highly recommend Shibu Ya Soho - a small sushi bar in the centre of London, which prides itself on authentic and innovative sushi of the highest quality, as well as a dignified service offered by its staff.", "date_of_review": "7 November 2016"}

They were incredibly friendly and the only comment I have is that a couple of the guys had incredibly strong accents and it was pretty loud (general hubbub only, nothing bad), but aside from that, my deafness is not an issue! We had a combination of the small plates, black cod and some rolls and they were gorgeous. Is the black cod a bit 'much' at \u00a318 for two skewers? Probably, but it was delicious. The taquitos were the best of the bunch along with the Sao Paulo (I think) rolls.

We arrived early and checked in at the restaurant reception and said we were ready to sit down at the table as soon as it was ready. We was told that unfortunately the table was not available. We waited in the bar and had a drink. There was no where to sit, no where to put our drinks down and no one offered to take our coats.  We waited for 30 minutes until our booked table at 20:15. We asked again for our table and after another 10 minutes wait we was finally seated. The restaurant was half full so I have no idea why we was made to wait for the table?  We were then rushed though our dinner within 40mins, being asked to order from the menu constantly and our wine classes continuously being topped up when they were still half full just to empty the bottle I guess and for a further bottle to be ordered? After the main meals we were finished we were asked if we wanted to have desert, we asked if we can wait 5 minutes, we was then pushed again after 3mins, we replied can we order a drink and have a desert in a bit we was then told 'no, you have to leave the table within 10mins and have a drink back at the bar.' We said to the waitress that we did not wish to go back to the bar and stand and asked if there was a table or seats available. She said no she couldn't help as it's a different department.  We then asked to speak to a manager. We were rudely greeted by 'Auelie'?. The lady arrived to the table in an annoyed and unfriendly manner.  We explained we were being asked to leave the table within 1 hour. The manger snapped back to say we had been there for 2 hours and that we should leave! We explained we were seated late and we had been rushed through our meal. She wasn't interested.  We paid our \u00a3400 bill and left.

The place was crammed and we were sitting in the middle of 3 tables which were too close to each other! We were greeted by our waiter and ordered our drinks. When it came, the drinks were given to the table next to us which shows how unorganised the place is! The sushi arrived and it was hard and appeared to have been prepared for a while. When the dessert arrived, it had 'Happy 4th Birthday' and the waiter had sung happy birthday to me. I was absolutely shocked and embarrassed and told the waiter it wasn't my birthday.  He said sorry and stormed off. I was in disbelief as it is outrageous that he thought it was my birthday- '4th birthday!!!!' despite being asked for ID when entering the tower! Not only did he not ask for a replacement, it seemed as though it didn't matter. The waiter that introduced himself to us was never around. He even laughed about the desert disaster and told us 'nevermind' and that to leave it for 'next time' We laughed it off, not to make a big scene but seriously... What are sushisamba up to hiring these people that do not understand customer service???? When we looked around, we could see about 4 waiters standing and speaking to each other laughing and joking while there were customers needing attention. I would not recommend this place, only if you place to have a starter and a drink for the view!!! Worth going to Duck and Waffle instead as they had a better service.", "date_of_review": "26 October 2016"}

All were exciting and enjoyable! My partner and I have this deal where on each of our birthdays we pick somewhere both of us want to go. SUSHISAMBA has been on both of our lists for a long time! It did not disappoint! We both love sushi and have been lucky to sample some exquisite sushi in many different restaurants and countries but SUSHISAMBA also delivers on ambiance and hospitality. As already mentioned, we were there for a birthday, my partners birthday and as he nipped off to the bathroom, our host Gary took the opportunity to inquire was it a special occasion. Upon my confirmation, he assured me that for dessert, he would make sure a candle was present. He was true to his word, a candle did appear in our special dulce de leche dessert but apart from that, I really enjoyed and appreciated the atmosphere that Gary helped to create - it was comfortable and hospitable. From the very moment I arrived, I felt welcome and looked after. The meal was delicious ( the tempura small plate shrimp and the S\u00e3o Paulo sushi!!!!) but what I really enjoyed was that everyone there genuinely wanted to make sure that it was. The decor, ambiance and food are all amazing - we had a terrific night.

I appreciate this was in the fine print of the reservation form, but I was disappointed they felt the need to enforce it. The food was exotic & tasty,but no one took the trouble to explain what was being served. Towards the end of the meal, they literally rushed us off our chairs.I suspect they had another reservation. If they had made that clear, we would have paced accordingly.  As a group of 10 people we had a full meal with drinks. So you can imagine we did spend a reasonable amount here.

Food - Sushi Samba is a mix of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine.  The sushi is colourful but quality could be better. I'd happily go to Eat Tokyo (Soho) over the sushi here. They had a nice warm sushi, a bit different with melted cheese on top (El Topo). Their robata is standard, and the miso black cod ordered was a little burnt/over coloured (this should not be happening at \u00a318 a dish?!). Whilst we looked at the eye-watering prices of kobe beef (one dish is priced at \u00a31,000!!), we opted for a 'reasonable' \u00a346 dish of CHURRASCO RIO GRANDE (ribeye, chorizo, aged picanha) which looked good (see my photo), tasted good but not amazing. We tried a few other dishes but nothing to write about. Overall, I wouldn't return.

The food is too greasy, too fried, much too sweet and flat. This is really a venue for the super rich foreign students who have too much cash to dispense of. You may want to stop by there for a couple of drinks and the view, but then again there is always the problem to get in. Nowadays venues like these have to put on the airs of exclusivity in order to attract the kind of nouveau clientele they aim for.

I informed the waitress that I did not wish to go back to the cattle pen, I therefore wanted to talk to the manager to ask why we was being pushed out of our table within 1 hour.

I ordered a whiskey on the rocks for my boyfriend and I ordered the batida de mango.  If I am brutally honest my cocktail wasn't very special at all, it didn't taste like a cocktail bar cocktail, just like one I could make myself at home if I'm totally honest, and it was very very expensive too at \u00a314!  The views however are stunning, absolutely spectacular especially at night all lit up, worth it for the view.  There was a very cheeky tip charged without my permission. Automatically added to the receipt before paying. So be careful of this. \u00a330 for 1 cocktail and a single shot of average whiskey was extremely overpriced.

I think a place like Sushisamba needs employees that provide good service because they are happy to work for the brand and want to represent the brand and not just for the tips.

Right from the start with the Edamame beans with Volcanic salt the food was wonderfully presented, cooked and delicious. Particular hits were the Salt & Pepper Squid and the Prawn tempura - absolutely sensational. The Samba roll was a bit too spicy (overpowered the other flavours) but otherwise every dish was excellent. Of course you can't overlook the view which dials up the experience another notch, and I would definitely recommend a quick drink on the terrace bar under the amazing lit-up tree.

There was plenty I enjoyed, eating here isn\u2019t quite the same as eating sushi from elsewhere, I would recommend going and would recommend sampling as much as possible, its certainly not converting me to a sushi eater, but I would certainly return and eat the same again.

When you arrive at the top of the elevator it's not entirely obvious where to go, and trying to speak to a waiter proved fruitless as they just hurried past. It didn't take long to spot that we just needed to go over to the other side of the bar though. The food was certainly delicious; we had some sushi dishes (rolls) followed by the churrasco platter. No complaints there, very much enjoyable, though portion sizes were't all that large so we ordered a few more dishes to fill up. Decor and ambiance was nice when dark outside and of course the views are spectacular. To be fair to our waiter, he was friendly but just seemed to be rushing about alot. When asking for the bill he didn't even face us, just slipped the metal tray on the table and walked straight off again. Decided to have another drink before leaving...miserable barman who came accross rather arrogant, showed no friendliness or enthusiasm whatsoever, but still of course helped himself to a 12.5% service charge for opening a beer and making a gin & tonic. We enjoyed the evening, but these types of restaurant are not just about the food but the whole experience and this place falls WAY short of the mark in the service department and I won't be back in a hurry. There are far better options with impeccable service in the same price bracket.

I was among a party of 16 guests for a birthday lunch on the Sunday before the bank holiday. Upon arrival we were not sure where to go as the reception is not clearly visible. So we were standing there at the entrance and to our disappointment nobody even acknowledged us with only a few glances from passing staff. After waiting there for a while we noticed the barman in the outside terrace bar was free so we approached him to point us in the right direction. Even when politely asking for his attention he didn't even look at us and only after persisting a bit more did he bother to take notice. His final response to our question was \"go and ask the reception\" and looked away from us immediately. He wasn't serving anyone else at the time and wasn't at all busy - he was just plain rude! Feeling like we were drawing blood from a stone, we eventually found the reception staffed by two young ladies who also didn't seem to care that we were there and needed to be shown where to go to sit. Once we had entered the main first level dining area everything else after that point was fine and the serving staff were very welcoming and informative of the dishes arriving at our table. It's the initial \"welcome at the door\" that was a major let down because, well, there was NO welcome.

The service was fine, until I asked for NO horseradish mayo on my kobe slider. The waitress delivered it WITH horseradish mayo.

It was pretty special, I'd definitely return for a special occasion.  The waiter explained the menu very thoroughly and talked about the options we had, to just order around 15 dishes between 5 people or go for more of a chefs choice. We chose the chefs choice with Kobe beef (without is a bit cheaper) and after asking some questions such as \"how spicy do you like your food\" and any allergies, the food started flowing. Upon reflection, I'm relieved we didn't order ourselves because we probably couldn't have picked a selection as well as the chef did and one of our guests did say that although this was his third visit, it was the best by far because of the food choice. Every dish was excellent and the favourites of the group was the Black Cod and the Tuna Ceviche. Everything was portioned for our table, so 5 of everything and there was a mix of meats, sushi rolls and raw fish. Some of the flavours were so so rich and like nothing I'd ever had before. The Beef was very nice but not nice enough for the price in my opinion. We shared 3 deserts at the end and didn't expect anything particularly great because it's not this restaurants selling point but we were pleasantly surprised. Our favourite was the Chilli Chocolate Moose, closely followed by the Chocolate Banana cake.  Our table didn't order Wine or Sake, only Beer and G&Ts so maybe we missed out on another element of culinary deliciousness but to be honest, the food was so good, I don't really care if we did. The bill was sobering at \u00a3135 a head, but we had quality food, excellent service and of course, a lovely view. My only complaint was the volume of the waiters - they were too quiet when explaining dishes and many had quite thick accents too so speaking a little slower and louder would've been better.  If you visit here then I have three tips. Go with an open mind, take your credit card and put your menu choice in the hands of the chef. Enjoy!", "date_of_review": "4 September 2016"}

Our reservation was for 10pm as that was the only time slot available, so we dutifully arrived early to take in the views and have a cocktail.  Upon arriving, we had the same issue that many others did, in that there is no one to greet you when you arrive out of the elevators and into the restaurant. Seems they still haven't moved their 'reception' desk to the side where guests actually should be 'received.' After walking around aimlessly, we were finally spotted by a waitress who told us to go get a drink at the bar. After an inordinately long wait for any service and then another long wait for our drinks to arrive, I was underwhelmed by the cocktails - all smoke and mirrors. A glass overstuffed with ice and other greenery meant you had maybe 3 sips of the cocktail before it was gone. Poor value and not particularly pleasant to have ice shooting all over the place as you attempt to mix your drink.  At 10.15pm when we still hadn't been seated at our table, we were ready to leave. So I went over to the waitress and asked if our table was ready, which finally, it was. Well, when we walked into the main dining area, we were surprised to see quite a number of tables empty! So it beggars the question, why were we kept waiting for so long! Once seated, the waiter - who's uniform of black shirt and shiny polyester orange tie resembled an IT guy from 2003 trying to dress up - explained the menu and was initially quite pleasant. When 20 mins after ordering we still hadn't been served any food whatsoever, I asked politely for him to check on our order. He was reluctant to as he said it just 'comes as it comes.' I reminded him that it was 10.45pm, and we were supposed to be seated at 10pm, so it was getting pretty late and to not have even a little starter to pick at...it wasn't really good enough. He then went off in a bit of a huff mumbling something else as he walked off. This was the second point in the night where we thought, let's just leave.  Once the food arrived, it was tasty. But hard to enjoy given the long wait, the poor attitude from the waiter and the time of night. The tacos with tuna were the highlight as well as the miso cod with corn, but the rest of the dishes were average at best and unmemorable.  I haven't detailed every little issue I have with this restaurant as I think the above is enough, but suffice to say, I won't be back. Sure, the views are pretty cool but that's the best part about this place; the decor (and waiter's uniform) is dated, the music playing is maybe 15 years old, the service is rude and offhand and the food average at best.

Two issues come to mind - if the discretionary surcharge is automatically added to the bill why not be up front and include this in the stated price for each drink on the bar list. (The surcharge issue was certainly not obvious on said bar list, if at all present.)  Secondly I was left wondering if my cash had ever got into the till and was this why I was not offered change.

The location is wonderful - 38 floors up with superb views of London - and the food is out of this world. Not many places can get away with a Japanese/Peruvian/Brazilian fusion, but they really do it perfectly here. Each dish has a hint of each cuisine (rather than having a section of the menu for each cuisine), and it's presented beautifully and tasted delicious. The drinks were also really good quality and very imaginative. The service was attentive and friendly - definitely not pretentious - while the bill reflected the quality of the whole place (c.\u00a3200 for two of us stufffing ourselves and having a few drinks). I'd happily go again and again, and would heartily recommend it. Don't be put off by the intimidating and prescriptive pre-arrival email ('don't be late! don't wear casual clothes! we can turn you away if we like! give the table back after 90 minutes!'), as the service in person is the complete opposite.", "date_of_review": "30 August 2016"}

Generally we prefer under-stated restaurants where authentic, quality food is the priority, but on this occasion it was our daughter's birthday so we wanted somewhere with a bit of glitz and glamour - Sushi Samba seemed to be the perfect choice for lunch given its rooftop setting and spectacular views, especially as weather forecast for the Bank Holiday weekend was good. First impressions unfortunately not great - arrived on 38th floor and no-one there to greet us. We made our way to the outside bar (where red tree is) to have a drink before lunch. After 10 mins of waiting to be served we were told that bar was closed and if we wanted drinks out there we would need to go and order from the inside bar and take them out ourselves - very unhelpful!  The inside bar is a small area with only a handful of tables and chairs to the one side by the window. The staff there weren't particularly friendly and it felt too warm, so we ordered our drinks and headed to restaurant.  For our lunch we were given the option of a table inside the restaurant, or on the outside terrace. The outside terrace is lovely and has the best views. There is a lounge seating area at one end, and the dining area at the other. We asked the hostess if we could finish our drinks in the lounge area first, and then move to our table (further along the terrace) for lunch as we still had a bit of time. She said that was absolutely fine. Whilst having our drinks an extremely officious male member of staff in a dark suit came over and told us we couldn't sit there as that area was reserved for people who were dining in the restaurant. We explained that we had a reservation for lunch in 10 minutes time and that we were just having a quick drink first. He kept arguing with us that we shouldn't be there, and then having consulted the hostess who had originally told us we could have drinks there, reluctantly agreed we could stay. He then went on to tell us in a very condescending manner exactly what time it was, and to point out that we had a two hour time slot for our table for lunch, so if we spent too long on our drinks we would be eating into that time and they may need to give our table to someone else! The way he spoke to us was unacceptable. He put a real damper on things and at that point we were tempted to pay for our drinks and leave. However, we persevered and stayed on for lunch and things did get better. Our waiter over lunch was polite and efficient and the food was good. But the highlight for us were the views. Also worth mentioning is that in places, notably the ladies toilets, it is looking a tad tired and tatty and could do with some redecoration. Our meal for the six of us including drinks was almost \u00a3600 - we do not begrudge spending that sort of money if the overall experience is excellent, but on this occasion we felt the service fell far short of expectations, and for this reason we wouldn't recommend or dine there again.", "date_of_review": "30 August 2016"}

When our final bill came there were a number of drinks, including champagne , totalling \u00a380 that had been added that we did not have. We brought this to the waiter's attention and a woman, I assume the duty manager , told us that we did have the drinks ! A half hour discussion then followed with her accusing my husband of lying by saying that she was going to check the cctv to prove she was correct. We would have been very happy for that to happen and encouraged her to do so as maybe then she would have apologised for the errors made by the bar. She eventually extremely reluctantly and with very bad grace, removed the items from our already massive bill.  I have never encountered such an unpleasant, aggressive , rude person in a customer service role. There are obviously problems in their system of ordering drinks at the bar and adding to the correct bill and a bigger problem of customer service training. Check your bill, we can't be the only customers this happens to. Mistakes happen but there is no excuse for such poor , rude , unpleasant service .", "date_of_review": "23 August 2016"}

The door man at the ground floor, was very arrogant, unwelcoming and actually rude to us. I am Italian and I can deal with abrupt but his behaviour was unacceptable. I had to wear orthotics as I have thorn a tendon in my foot. it was the hottest day in years and I was wearing black flip flops (my other orthotics are in boots). As I had read the dress code I had a pair of flats in my handbag. He refused to let me in in those shoes - which is acceptable - but he also refused to call the manager to check if we could make an exception. He arrogantly and rudely said he was a dancer and I was overreacting and that I just had to walk to the table. I am not complaining about the fact that he did not let me in but that- with what you pay to eat in that place he should actually be accompanying me to the table holding my bag! Well, we made it to the restaurant. The view was beautiful... out of the windows, but if you looked up the ceiling lights (on every table) are literally covered in dust, big chunks of dust. We ordered food, we waited quite a bit for the food to come, not a problem as I was there with a friend to have a good time and chat. Some food arrived, some was missing and arrived later.. anyway.. I am not expecting japanese quality fish but it was slightly superior to tesco. The fusion idea was good and some of the twists were very good but the raw fish which was in most dishes was just average which makes this restaurant very overpriced. On the way out, to my surprise I saw some people in flip flops.... I emailed the customer service who emailed back saying they will get someone to phone me and discuss further. I have never heard from them. Bottom line, I may recommend sushi samba for a drink on a night out.

Service was slow to start with as the restaurant was clearly very busy, however the staff were helpful, knowledgeable and quick to pick up on things. Wine selection is minimal, but the rose is lovely (very light) and the South African white is equally nice. Food is superb, but then for the price I would expect it. The Samba salad was fantastic and very prettily presented. We picked 3-4 options from all the menus and shared between us which worked very well. Other options which were really nice were pomegranate tuna and eggplant. I personally loved the way the sushi was presented with the bright colours (just not enough wasabi and ginger on the plate). the wasabi is also very nice, has a good kick to it. Overall the experience was great and we did have a nice time, but I've given a 4/5 for their lack of clear 'rules' for their restaurant. Being a 21st birthday i had bought a small helium balloon, but when i arrived I was told I couldn't take it in to the restaurant because it didn't go well with the aesthetics (fair enough although I had checked the website first and there is no mention of this, but does state you have to wear appropriate clothing (i.e. no flip flops and trainers)). I was told told to leave it tied to a post outside, which i thought was a little unfair as i would have happily put it in the cloakroom, but apparently I couldn't take it in to the building. As there is information on their website about a dress code, i feel it should mention this as well to avoid other people doing the same.

We ordered all kinds of food: miso soup, tempura, sushi, robata-yaki veggies, etc.. Most of dishes were tasty. Only Kobe Beef Ishiyaki was rather for fun than taste. They bring a hot stone kit so you can grill sliced beef at the table on your own. Smoke comes up, and you get attentions from other tables, but it was so not worth \u00a3120 because beef was cut too thinly to tell if it\u2019s Kobe beef or OG beef! As for drinks, Champaign, sake, plum sake, all were good. (Somehow we didn't try their cocktails, but next time!) Our server was not sophisticated but friendly. Basically this is a fun and stylish place to go. When it's fun, everything tastes better. I will be happy to go back there anytime!", "date_of_review": "11 August 2016"}

Yet, in my opinion the music was a bit too loud which made the evening a bit unpersonal due to the difficulty of having a normal discussion. This might be to encourage akward but fancy colleague meals.. For the service, it was a very polish service with the bad habit of filling up glasses straight after one gulp. It would have been nice to have one waiter assigned to the table to help with advice and comfort. But the restaurant is busy and this might be a reason why. Last, but not least, the food. In my opinion the sushis were very average (We had a combination of four different types) with a bit of a moist texture which I found a bit odd. The four different plates did not have much different within the taste, I was disappointed. But I have to say I am glad to have continued the experience up until the dessert because if there's a reason to go to Sushi Samba it would be for the special dessert which consists of a dulce de leche ice cream on cookie crumble with a chocolate sponge cake with a bit of coconut. This desert was delicious and one of the best I've had in London. Therefore, Sushi Samba might want to rebrand for what they are really good at: Dessert with a view.

Gyoza were amazing, and the Sushi rolls that came out were too. We also sampled the steak platter, awesome. One friend was a Vegetarian so we had a selection of that food genre too, and he was happy enough it seems. Service was on point, would I go back? I do believe it to be a bit of a one off to see it place, that said though they didnt really treat the guests as such, which was good. One observation, it was too hot. Either the AC wasnt on, or the doors were not open enough and with the sun out it was like a green house for a while...even the girls were hot.

Guys you are barmen not Tom Cruise!!! The worst was the Latin looking chap - his attitude towards all the customers was downright rude. You could let him away with such an appalling attitude if his drinks were great but they were strictly average - he needs to remember if you want customers to come back you need to at least be pleasant particularly if your drinks are not great - customer service training required urgently!

We nabbed a space by the bar on the roof terrace and ordered a few rounds between us as the evening went on. The atmosphere here is brilliant, even better on a hot summers evening. The downside to the place is that for a rooftop bar, you can't really see any of the London views as there are quite high walls all around you. There is one look out point, but it;s normally crowded with people. Also get here early to secure a space on the terrace / not have to fight your way through people / or to the bar.

We tried a couple of different types of sashimi, a selection of sushi rolls and the salt and pepper squid along with some cocktails and sake.  As someone for whom the idea of eating raw fish is about as appetising as tucking into Donald Trump's g-string, I actually found our food to be among the nicest mouthfuls I've ever had. I'm assured it's on par with great sushi in Japan itself, which again you'd hope so given the price, which isn't cheap but is pretty much what you'd expect for dining at one of the better-known restaurants in the capital. The staff were really nice, our waiter was very knowledgeable and helped us pick the best sake, which packed quite a punch and made the lift ride down on the way out very interesting. My only complaint would be that we waited an unusually long time for all of our drinks - most of our food had arrived before our cocktails, which were ordered quite a while before. We were hoping to be on to a glass of wine by the time the food came out so it felt a bit strange. Given the cost of drinks in these swanky places, you'd expect the business model to be getting them out as quickly as possible so that you get through them quicker and part with even more moolah! My local curry house adopts this strategy by getting us hammered before we've even ordered the food and they do very well out of us. Happy to offer a consultancy service to Sushi Samba if they're reading this. Despite the drinks thing, it was a lovely meal and the food was really great - not to mention the views across town.

The view is amazing, although taking the glass lift to the 38th floor is pretty scary; it goes pretty fast so feels a bit like a theme park ride! The restaurant is great, with friendly and attentive staff who explain the menu in advance - although the guy spoke so fast none of us had any idea what he said! 2 of us shared salt & pepper squid - best I've had, shrimp tempura - also amazing but not at all what we expected as the shrimps are covered in the mayo and vinaigrette rather than the sauce being served on the side and samba london - a selection of 8 sushi rolls. These were beautifully presented and all wrapped in brightly coloured seaweed. Our veggie friend had the veggie maki and eggplant robata - we ordered an extra plate of this as it was so delicious us meat eaters wanted to eat some too. Desserts were also nice and very well presented. We shared the organic red chocolate chili peppers and passion fruit cake - which came with a candle and Happy Birthday message on it. This was a lovely gesture as we'd only mentioned when we arrived that we were there to celebrate a birthday. We also had 2 cocktails each - the sambatini; their monthly special which in July was blend of sake and strawberries. We all enjoyed this. Then I had chucumber as I'm a G&T fan, while the other 2 chose different ones. After this we decided to have a drink in the Tree Bar outside. Again, very lovely although not such a great view due to the high plants around the seats. What ruined it slightly was each being charged service for a drink we ordered, paid for and collected from the bar. We all thought this was rather cheeky and a bit of a rip off!

The outside bar is a highlight for warm summer nights and the cocktails are up there with the best in the City.  Food - It's a fusion of Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian and it far surpassed my expectations. We let our waiter choose a selection of dishes and we were not disappointed! Each one was utterly delicious. We had a huge selection of dishes and, of those, I highly recommend the following: Shrimp Tempura / Crispy Taquitos / Black Cod with Peruvian Corn (standout dish) / Poussin Teriyaki / Tiger Maki Rolls / Tokyo Sky Tree Rolls.  The desserts are also of a very high standard and were the perfect end to our meal. I recommend the banana chocolate cake pictured below. It was heavenly and of all the desserts I sampled was the standout. Drinks - The wine list is extensive and the waiting team ensure that your glass is always full, but not in a pushy manner. As I mentioned above, the cocktails are as good as you would expect from a high end restaurant / cocktail bar. You will pay circa. \u00a312 per cocktail which is standard in London. Wine and champagne prices vary vastly as per any high end restaurant. Service - The waiting staff are excellent. Friendly and helpful. We were served by Adam who was absolutely great. Be warned - this place is popular and they will turn your table in 2 hours so don't expect to linger for longer. When the 2 hours is up your bill will be presented to you (as politely as it is possible to be given that you are being moved on) and you can move to one of the two buzzy terraces with your drinks should you wish to carry on. Price - Yes, it's expensive, but you get what you pay for and you won't feel at all cheated given the quality and culinary craftsmanship served up here. All in all a great evening.

On my second visit, I just popped by for drinks but found the crowd to be way too formal for my liking. I've visited Sushisamba in the states and much prefer it there.

The view of the restaurant was great as well as you are on the 38th floor overlooking the city. There are a couple of bars where you can order very nice drinks, however, we didnt really use them.  The only critism I had was the speed our nirigi was delivered. We had to wait for a good 40 mins and we finished all other dishes before those nigiri sushi arrived - at which point we were almost full. I would have enjoyed those gorgeous nigiri sushi more if they came first. Price wise, slightly on the expansive side but hey, thats what you pay for the great view and good service.

So many people were complaining about the prices and the staff that I was cautious. But curious as well. When we arrived downstairs, we were cheerfully welcomed and accessed the rooftop, being taken in charge by a hostess. Our table was not ready yet (it was 9.50 pm and we were supposed to seat at 10pm) so we had a quick tour on the crowdy terrace (no surprise, Friday night )). When we came back to the bar, another hostess came to us and drove us to our table, as required, by the window. Perfect timing for a perfect place. We ordered Kobe beef in raviolis, sushis and see food, and everything was perfect. Then, I decided to have some sake. The wine waitress came to me as the one I had ordered was unavailable, and she advised me very gently on other choices. I appreciated that she made the move, and I consider this attention as very professional. The bill was what I was supposed to pay, no problem. What do some people expect? come, drink and dine in this place for nothing? The products are really fresh, home prepared, and there is plenty of staff to take care of the business, so, that's not surprising.

It has spectacular views over London and is one of the reasons why people go there. I was taken there by my daugher as a belated Father's Day present. If I am out and about I tend to take my camera with me. Being on the 35th floor on a clear day was too much of a draw, so while waiting at the bar for some drinks I took some family photographs and some out of the window. I was told to put my camera away, \"You are not allowed to use a DLSR camera here\". I questioned why, but did not get any sensible reason, I can only assume that there is a perception of a security risk as you are looking over the City of London, It took the edge off of the lunch. Ironically I was allowed to use an iPhone 6S to take images, and probably ended up with larger and more detailed images as I took panorama's. Whatever idiot came up with the idea of stopping people from using DSLR's should also stop compact camera's and phones if there is truly a security risk (which I doubt). Many cameras carry similar resolutions to DLSR's.  Getting to the food and ambience, it is a pleasant enough place with good food at outrageous prices. Three of us had what can be best described as a light lunch with drinks which carried a price of \u00a3127.69. Staff are very attentive, and if you are not careful, drinks that have not been completely consumed are removed and then you are asked if you want another one. Judging from the lunch time clientele it appears to be more of a business venue for the city rather than casual dining. I expect if I was on expenses it would be on my favourites list as well. For me, there are much better Japanese Sushi restaurants in London with more reasonable prices.", "date_of_review": "26 July 2016"}

The location cannot be faulted, especially on a warm sunny summer evening. The bar area was busy at first but thinned out after a while as people drifted off to eat or go on elsewhere. One downside though was the wait. We had a table booked for 7.45pm but didn't get seated until 8.20pm. It seems that waits are not uncommon, so don't go there if you want prompt seating. The food was excellent and not overpriced, unless you chose the beef. The staff helpful and polite. The biggest disappointment though was the price of drinks. Even allowing for the location \u00a37.50 for a small 33cl bottle of beer is well over the top. The wine list also top heavy with seriously priced wines, fine perhaps for a special occasion, but for a night out with friends excessive. We initially chose a white from the lower price range (\u00a345) and were very disappointed with it. The saki though was a real treat.

The lovely lady confirmed that we were welcome to come & confirmed that the dress code (as it was a weekend & I usually go to SS on weekdays for business lunches or meetings) is \"casual elegant\" & as long as we weren't wearing ripped jeans it was ok. When we got to the door it was obvious that the doormen & the lady over the phone has different dress code guidelines as all of a sudden my friend who was wearing sandals with one strap couldn't get in as her footwear was supposedly \"inappropriate\" (despite seeing people leaving & within SS in Tom's espadrilles, sandals, trainers, hiking shoes to name a few). And there began an evening of terrible service. Our waitress was rude, obnoxious, aggressive and menacing. I am unsure on whether it was racially fuelled or she's was going through personal problems & taking it out on work. But quite frankly her attitude was absolutely disgusting. We addressed it to the bar manager & although he apologised, the waitress refused to apologise & was completely insolent. Which is a quite sad because I used to really like sushi samba before this experience. As you can see from my other reviews I don't tend to write unwarranted bad reviews, however I was so shocked at the service (or lack there of) we received. I frequent high end & michelin starred establishments regularly and have never been treated with such insolence.

More beautiful dishes came to follow, with our waiter always checking if we are ok, enjoying our meal and whenever we were full to say. His recommendations were divine, I can\u2019t even say my favourite dish as they were all as specular as each other. We had the SHRIMP TEMPURA, CRISPY TAQUITOS YELLOWTAIL, SEASONAL VEGETABLE TEMPURA, BLACK COD, S\u00c3O PAULO all magnificent. We were celebrating a anniversary and have already said we will go back for our next one. We were lucky enough to sit outside, at around 7pm so we had a magnificent view of London and sunset, it was just beyond amazing. The food, the view, the staff, it\u2019s the ultimate experience!", "date_of_review": "19 July 2016"}

We were offered a table on the terrace and declined thinking it would be too hot, however there was no sun on that side of the building and we should have taken it!!! The whole restaurant is glass and it was HOT inside until the pulled the shades down. Once they pulled them down it was so lovely. Service was great. MUST ORDER BLACK COD with miso. It was the single best dish. I also enjoyed the yellowtail with jalape\u00f1o and lemongrass - clean and fresh. Did not care for the deconstructed English breakfast or the shrimp tempura or the coffee flakes over chocolate ganache. The flakes stuck to the back of your teeth ( there was so much ) and was really flavorless. should have just been the ganache and nuts. would have been much better. The shrimp tempura was soggy with too much mayo sauce on it. The vegetable tempura we saw at other tables looked a lot better. Very light and crispy. All of the cocktails looked very pretty even though we did not order any this trip. Attention to presentation is important here. All in all recommend if you are ok with the travel from central London. Took us about 37 min by taxi $$$$", "date_of_review": "19 July 2016"}

Ridiculous prices and under par drinks (the G&T was flat).  I'd like to understand why places like this think it's OK to add 12.5% 'service charge' to a bar bill. The barman has poured out a drink - he has not spent a couple of hours waiting the table, coming and going from the kitchen, or anything similar. So why are we effectively tipping him 12.5%?

It is beautifully decorated and the views are just stunning. Unfortunately the weather wasn't nice enough to go outdoors but the outdoor areas looked great. We shared some taquitos which were my highlight, gyoza, a kobe slider and then opted for 3 types of nigiri sushi and California rolls. All of the food was delicious and really couldn't be faulted. A few things, however, weren't great. I felt that our waiter was a bit overbearing and was very keen to upsell to us the whole time. Also the room was unbearably hot. The other thing was the cost of the food - nearly \u00a3100 for the food and two small glasses of wine. They had added in a 12.5% service charge which I thought was steep for a quick lunch for two people.

First impressions the door staff are a little power hungry, my friend stood next to the doorman and he made her move one step to the right which seemed really petty. The thing that hits you more than anything is the amazing views, these really are spectacular of our great City. We proceeded up to the bar as we were a little early for our dinner reservation, our Husband's ordered the drinks and both said the man serving was very offish bordering rude. We went out on to the terrace which was a little chilly but they have big patio heaters that do the trick. When it was time for our table, we were about to be shown to the table when they realised they had given it to someone else so we had to wait a few minutes for another one, no really biggy. Once we got to the table, again the views amazing, and this restaurant was heaving. We ordered drinks and all opted for the tasting menu at \u00a3100 per person. Each dish arrived swiftly and the food was beautiful. Little dishes each consisting of all different delicacies. If you liked a particular dish you could have them bring you another one. When you see how small the dishes are you think you will never get full, but you do. The only weird thing I would say is on a couple of the dishes there were only 3 pieces on the plate, and there were 4 of us, strange. The service was really good and our waiter was very friendly, made up for some of the other staff who weren't quite as friendly. This is a restaurant for some who may want to visit on a special occasion, this is not a cheap restaurant by any means so take plenty of money. I would still visit SushiSamba again, but with so many other wonderful restaurants in London to try, I probably never will, but that's not too say I didn't enjoy it.", "date_of_review": "14 July 2016"}

We were very pleased with the food as the menu was difficult to figure out, so I asked the very helpful waiter to serve us a variety based upon a fixed price per head, and it worked perfectly. We had more than enough food and a very good mix of different stuff both hot and cold, meat and fish. Drinks were reasonably priced for London and although they told us on booking we had to vacate the table after 2 hours, we stayed much longer and were never bothered. All In all, a very memorable night, which was always our hope, and the friendly efficient staff helped make it happen.

I needn't have worried - everything about the experience was spot-on (and I genuinely mean practically perfect). The setting for one thing is mind-boggling - a view across London that takes your breath away. There's only one thing that beats it, and that's the menu. The Brazilian, Peruvian and Japanese elements combine in a tour de force of exciting and exotic dishes, and each was as tasty as the last. I can't recommend the scallop seviche enough (melt-in-the-mouth is an overused cliche but I'm going to apply it anyway), and the lamb chops soaked in miso just exuded bursts of the best umami flavour I've encountered. The sea bass tempura was as tasty as it was beautiful, and I've never had California Rolls that had so much intricate detail, and combined so well. But the star dish was the black cod skewers - sticky, caramelised, and falling apart in pearly white flakes. Also important to mention the staff were incredible - friendly, warm, and oh so helpful (our waiter Yannick was a dream.)

The bar was already getting busy at 5pm, so we went to our table in the very impressive restaurant - full height glass on 3 sides and a very funky bamboo and pendant ceiling assembly. We'd booked way in advance but the only available dinner slot for a Tuesday was 5pm... so book early - booking start 2 months in advance and I think it wise to get in fast! Service was helpful, prompt and polite - and almost a touch over the top - but no worries about being left without a drink.  We had a mix of Japanese and Peruvian food which worked well and was really superb. The barbecued Teriyaki style poussin was excellent, as was the Crispy Lobster Taquitos and the Shrimp Tempura. However having a Wagyu 1Kg Kobe beef on the menu for \u00a31,000 seemed a bit daft and to me risked appealing to the ostentatious and usually noisy Bolly brigade I'd prefer to avoid. The choice of Sakis is massive and we enjoyed chatting through which ones to try - and loved the one we chose. Dessert was similarly spectacular. It sounds really expensive, but actually for 2 of us, with our choice of six dishes, dessert and Saki, and including service, it was \u00a3150.

What let the whole place down was the appalling service in the outside bar. Upon arrival we headed outside for an aperitif before dinner. 15 minutes later we were still standing there waiting. What made it far worse was the unwillingness of the barman to acknowledge us or make any concession to the fact that there were paying customers waiting for a long time. How hard would it to say \"I'll be with you in a minute sir\" or \"I am sorry for the wait\". Instead he wandered around at a snails pace seemingly spending hours crushing ice or talking to his colleagues. When he finally deigned to serve us, we were informed of this privilege by the merest nod of his head in our direction and a raised eyebrow. The order was duly taken, served (5 minutes later) and paid for without him uttering a single syllable. Perhaps he is mute and therefore I am being unfair.

The heron tower is incredible and the views over London are amazing. The bar and outside area was beautiful and definitely nicer than the restaurant dining area. We love sushi and have eaten in every possible sushi restaurant we could have in London, and this one? It was okay. Food is really nothing special and ridiculously overpriced.  I don't want to say this was an overall awful experience, but it was hopelessly average. We arrived at 5.45 to fairly unpleasant and bored staff, that really did not seem happy to see their customers and really just didn't want to be there.  We ordered starters and then mains after, which we waited a very long time for. Considering we have a 2 hour table, we waited for food more than we actually ate, so much so, that we didn't have time to order dessert as our sitting was up. Not great service for a fancy restaurant.  The food was good, but not worth the price. The sushi was no better than anywhere else, which was disappointing.  It was a nice experience saved by the views, atmosphere and good cocktails. But if you are coming here to be blown away, expect to be disappointed. Would only recommend coming here for drinks and a few bites, not worth the overpriced dinner for average sushi.", "date_of_review": "5 July 2016"}

We felt that they took our \u00a3400 and wanted to throw us out as quickly as possible and really weren't bothered where too!!! We did sit outside round the fire pit, but the bar was not open outside, the seating was all wet and dishevelled and just very underwhelming, not a very nice ending to our evening. I had mentioned on our internet booking, and over the telephone that this was a birthday celebration, but they did noting to celebrate this event.

From reviews and reputation I'd expected high quality and an experience. To be fair, this could have been my perception and misunderstanding.  It starts well with an impressive ascent to the 38/39th floor. We decided on a pre-meal drink. It wasn't particularly busy at the bar but the lady who served us could not have been less welcoming. Didn't set a great tone. Atmosphere/ambience of bar was ok but could have been anywhere.  The restaurant was better situated with good views towards east London. Staff in restaurant much more professional, knowledgeable and welcoming.  Again, to be fair, I'm not a sushi expert. I do like different food experiences however. I found the menu less than clear. The waiter made an attempt to explain but his recommendation really was around the number of dishes rather than content.  The food when it came was good. I'd say that I made one bad choice for my taste but others may have enjoyed the dish.  Again, and I may have misunderstood the character of this restaurant, I can't help but reflect that the ambience and quality of food do not match the 'hype'.

The cocktails were incredible and the food was perfect. we had tiger shrimp, tacos, some chicken, veg dishes which were all amazing and cooked to perfection.

The best freebie ever. the bill was very reasonable too considering we ordered a starter, 5 main dishes, desert, and 6 cocktails all under \u00a3130 including service charges. then we moved on to the bar area which overlooks the river, the gherkin and some of the other big landmarks of london including St pauls cathedral, but we thought we would try the bar at duck and waffle which was 2 floors up. big mistake, as the stucture of the building has beams which block the view at eye level and I didn't like the veg themed cocktails.", "date_of_review": "16 June 2016"}

This is a really cool place! The restaurant is on the 38th floor and the dining experience begins with the lift. It's an outside glass lift that is really fast but amazingly smooth. I don't usually talk about lifts but the view and experience was great! The food was excellent. Japanese food with a South American twist. Sounds familiar? There is a world wide chain with a similar theme but I think this Sushisamba is much more fun! Food is delicious and beautifully presented. The views are great. Couples can especially have a fantastic view because the tables for two are right up against the windows. It is quite a vibrant restaurant but without being excessively noisy.  I would especially recommend the sushi rolls. Beautifully presented, absolutely delicious and probably the best value items on the menu. It is a sharing type menu and the sushi rolls are cut into about 6-8 pieces each. With a careful choice of wine, your bill can be less than 50 GBP per person. (As with most good restaurants, a bottle of wine can cost anything from 50 GBP to several hundred pounds.) Desserts were great so make sure you leave some room.  There is an outdoor roof-top type bar which you must try when dining here. It was a little crowded there when we arrived for our meal so we decided to have a drink outside after dinner instead.

We have seen the head cocktail maker sampling his cocktails on the channel4 tv show Sunday Brunch many a time and were looking forward to trying the cocktails. They were a complete let down, and overpriced for what they were.  My boyfriend found a small black fly on his taquitos. We informed the waiter who asked if it was ok. We said no we did not want to eat food that had flies crawling over it. He then spoke to the manager. The manager came to our table and asked if everything was OK. We said that no it was not, we had to explain again that not we did not want to eat food that had had a fly on it. The manager asked if we were still OK to eat it! We had to ask them to replace the food. They grudgingly replaced it and did not deduct the inconvenience from our bill which any other fine establishment would have done.

My dinner companions seemed to have no such problem choosing their dishes, and ordered a number of to share. The Kobe Beef Ishiyaki and the Black Cod were a particular highlight. The prices are expensive, but given the restaurant's location right next to the Gherkin it's not too surprising.

I appreciate I wasn't paying the bill, however the waiting staff all spoke in European accents we found hard to understand and would often \"sell up\". In one instance we decided to order a little bit more at the end of the meal and we received double our order of nigiri and sashimi and at \u00a34 per piece this hugely increased the bill. From approx 21 to 42 for a \"Final extra plate\". We actually sent the excess back and re ordered what we had originally asked for but if we had have been more \"British\" .. We may have ended up keeping this.. Overall I felt the food wasn't good value. If I were with my wife, would personally have a drink in the duck and waffle and then head to a sushi bar near by for good value sushi especially given we have eaten the same sushi in Japan for 40p per piece of nigiri as opposed to \u00a34.

It wasn\u2019t exactly what we had pictured for our romantic meal. We noticed there was another, much better table sitting empty and 5 minutes later when it was still empty, we asked if we could please move to it. We were told no we couldn\u2019t sit there because it was being held for another couple! Why was this other couple more important than us? It made us feel very belittled and it was a huge disappointment. We would have been more than happy to wait in the bar for a nicer table if given the option. The next issue was when trying to order some Saki \u2013 On our two attempts at ordering, the Saki \u201cexpert\u201d told us we weren\u2019t ordering the correct option to go with our meal and he then obliged us to order what he thought was best. It was extremely condescending and we felt forced to spend more than we wanted to on the Saki that he felt we should be having. After all of that we made the best of things and tried to enjoy ourselves, but then we were still waiting for one of our main dishes 15 minutes after finishing everything else (we had specifically asked for everything to be served together). A waitress started to clear or table and we enquired as to where this dish was, we were told it was just coming, however it then took another 20 mins for it to arrive? This was hugely inconvenient as by this time we had finished our 2nd carafe of Saki and didn\u2019t want to order more and so we had to eat our last plate without anything to drink. When the waiter brought our bill, he asked if we had enjoyed everything and I explained what happened with the last plate being delayed. He simply shrugged it off and said it was given to another table by mistake and that there was some staff training issues. I told him again that we weren\u2019t happy because it was inconvenient that we had to wait and he responded by asking me if I had enjoyed the dish anyway and completely undermined me. His attitude was appalling, I don\u2019t appreciate being treated like that. It was the final straw in our disastrous experience with Sushisamba. When I wrote to explain what happened and how unhappy we were, I received an email from guest relations saying they took my complain to heart and the restaurant Manager would be in touch shortly. It then took them over a month to get back to me, the Assistant Restaurant Manager, Marc, finally called me to apologise and invited us back for a complimentary drink to make up for our disappointment, he said all I had to do was email him to let him know when we\u2019d be coming and he\u2019ll look after us. Well I emailed him last Wednesday to say we\u2019d like to come on Saturday and he never even responded. The whole experience has left us feeling completely ripped off and bitterly disappointed.", "date_of_review": "3 May 2016"}

I love japanese and frequently eat in Roka, Nobu, Zuma and from the price of the Sushi Samba menu, I was expecting similar things. Absolutely not.  I cannot re-call much of the food we actually ate as it was all so sub-standard and the sushi rolls we had were not great (the signature ones, whatever they are...). Shrimp/prawn tempura is often my go-to dish in Japanese restaurants....here it came out pre-drenched in sauce, which was not only over-powering, but it also left the tempura completely soggy and a bit grim. The service was pretty bad ; I counted 5 different waiters who ended up serving us so no relationship could be built up, it was all really confusing and no one really knew what the hell was going on. I had to ask twice to get our wine filled, and as we left, no-one said thankyou or goodbye from the handful of un-interested waiters we had! I eat out like 3 times a week in London and have never felt compelled to write a negative review but this left a bad taste in my mouth.  Fortunately we went upstairs to Duck & Waffle (worth a go!) for a post-eat cocktail and as always, the staff there were lovely, accomadating and took the edge of the horror of Sushi Samba below.

The staff then showed us to the table , we were then given our waiter who was very good, all going good so far, then we order and I must say it was a complete disappointment, food was a complete let down.  We started with tempura prawns and squid, and it was not tempura the prawns were like frozen ones you get from tescos, very bland sauce over them.  Then we had the yellow tail which again was nothing special, (Defo better in Nobu) I was told to have the pork belly and that was the worst, it was served cold and chewy not at all with a little crunch, I don't know about most people but that's how I would like pork cooked! I could go on and after paying \u00a3250 on a meal I expected a lot more, I would not recommend this restaurant, if you want good food I would either go Nobus or Gilgamesh much better food! oh and 1 more thing they decide half way though the meal to close the smoking area, so had to go all the way back in the lift then outside so was not to happy about that especially after paying that amount on crap food, then to be told have to go all the way out the building for a cigarette!!

The only time they had available was 4pm even though we booked at least a month in advance but as we were celebrating we decided to book the early slot and make an evening of it.  Sadly, I didn't enjoy the experience at all and felt it is far from on par with Duck and Waffle. We arrived slightly early and sat in the bar for a cocktail. Mine turned out to be a glorified gin and tonic with some rather old looking lemon grass and pips from the lemon floating around which wasn't what you'd expect for around \u00a313 a drink. I left half my drink and we moved through to the restaurant.  The restaurant has very high ceilings and is bright and airy. Unfortunately the weather was awful so we couldn't see a thing out of the window. I really didn't enjoy the atmosphere and it seems to be a venue for loud corporate lunches with some arrogant people downing bottles of wine (from the bottle) and cheering! Not what you'd expect for a \u00a3200+ meal. These people need to have more respect or be asked to leave.  The food is varied and the menu includes a lot of meat options which I wasn't expecting for a sushi restaurant. We were there for the sushi so focused on those sections of the menu and I have to say they were very nice.  Drinks are extremely expensive and 250ml of sake will set you back around \u00a328. The food was served quickly and is good quality. I couldn't help feeling that I'd rather be at Sticks and Sushi spending half the amount of money but having a much nicer time.  I certainly won't be coming back and feel like this restaurant is much better suited to corporate types looking for a meal they can charge back to work. Definitely not an environment for a romantic meal.", "date_of_review": "18 April 2016"}

Whilst it's difficult to review Sushi Samba without commenting on the high prices.. I feel that a superior experience like this is relative to the higher than average prices. I struggle to think of a comparable experience to being situated 38 floors above ground with views across all of London, a two story bar serving almost any cocktail you ask for, a restaurant serving exemplary food; specifically Japanese with a Brazilian/Peruvian twist, & a roof terrace to rival all others, topped off with their stunning & unique orange tree feature! Sushi Samba always gets me in the party mood. The stunning decor, views across London & lively latin/samba-style music all add to an ambiance that you cannot observe in many other top London venues. I should add that you need to book in advance if you wish to dine in Sushi Samba - sometimes you need more than a month's notice to book dinner there. You cannot make a booking if you are just going for drinks, so if you're going to Sushi Samba on a popular night (such as a Friday) I would turn up early to avoid disappointment, since much of the bar space is reserved for first refusal of the dining guests. From the drinks menu, their espresso martini's, passion fruit cocktails & old fashioned are especially good. From the food menu, the black cod is amazing, as is the Kobe beef on hot stones & of course the sushi rolls.", "date_of_review": "13 April 2016"}

The main doorman said we could not go in due to being drunk, we had just eaten dinner and had a few drinks. Felt as though he was picking and choosing based on who he wanted in there. He was rude, arrogant and could be deemed as intimidating.  We headed round to another bar where there was a family celebrating there triplets 21st they were also not let in for being too drunk, the one which had been told this was sober. I'm pretty outraged by the behaviour and feel in this day and age people should not be victimised based on looks and age. I understand that they may want a certain clientele in there but there are ways this could have been communicated instead of just saying people are drunk. He refused to give us is name but was quite happy to put his ipad in my friends face saying he was filming her and would pass it on to her work, pretty sure that breaks data protection. I work in a client based profession and I would never dream of treating people the way we were treated last night What made me laugh the most is how drunk people were leaving, falling all over the place as they came out, front of house staff should be welcoming and friendly, not rude and arrogant.

The seviche salmon and lamb chops were very good but the teryaki poussin was escellent. Black cod seemed to go down well too.  The dessert menu had some good choices and we settled for mochi ice creams and the exotic fruit salad, the mochi being a very good and nicely presented selection.

Location: fantastic! 38th floor in a London bridge area skyscraper, the whole city at your feet Crowd: trendy sexy young n cool at night, tourist and few locals during the day. Food: as the name suggests, sushi with a Brazil flavor. Some combinations are interesting, some not so much. Miami version is definitely better. Raw materials quality average. The rice definitely not. They play it all on presentation and appearance, which I must admit is out standing. General impression: if you want to have fun with friends in a trendy place and do not care so much about top quality, this place is for you! Nice music, beautiful food, great cocktails (even if there's always too much ice). Location and the view make up for the rest. Price is on the high side, we spent the same amount the other night in Defune, so it depends on what you are looking for. If top quality it's definitely Defune!

We were seated promptly at our appointed time in a mediocre central table, next to a family with a small child. The first server's description of the menu was unintelligible, but thankfully it was repeated by another waiter with better English. We had an interesting mix of tempura, South American style ceviche, and sushi, and marinaded grilled black cod, chicken and lamb chops. Food was very good. Nice bottle of Washington state riesling a bit pricey at \u00a355. All was going well until the father on the table next to us sent something flying, splattering us and requiring a major clean up. My daughter's new boots got splattered, but fortunately we escaped any other major damage. Not a word f apology from our next door rude diners.

But... our wine glasses were always filled after just a few sips by the sommelier, and knowing it was my husband's birthday they sent a dessert decorated with small candles and a happy b-day message.

First he said that our booking was one hour earlier, which was not true. Following this he said that my friend was not dressed well enough to access the restaurant emphasising there was a dress-code.

The sashimi is also good.  My only reservations are the following. First, the whole dining experience consists of a somewhat unusual medley of mini-meals that are meant to be shared. Second, the views while nice are not the most interesting angles over London. You are mostly looking north towards the Olympic park. Not that much of visual interest but in the Spring the outdoor terrace opens and that must be more interesting.

Apparently, you can rock up without a booking and get a dinner table within an hour or so on most nights. Not absurdly priced and, to their credit, serves tap water. We would return with friends, especially if they are visiting from overseas. Annelies, our server, was super friendly. If anything, the staffing is a tad too attentive.

Not being desensitised to London prices, the shock of cocktails at \u00a313 + gradually wore off as the delicious combination of flavours worked their magic.  Whilst south American food doesn't obviously mix with Sushi, in this case the quality and ingenuity of the dishes is something to behold.  If I said this was probably my second best tasting experience, only beaten by Heston's Fat Duck then there is little more you need to know.

It was a bright if not sunny winters day and being on the 38th floor in the City of London, with windows all around made it very special.  The food was fascinating. Very different. Perfect for people who like grazing- we had lots of mini dishes to share and the flavours were great. The salad was a work of art and tasted great. This is probably not a good place for someone with a huge appetite as in the Japanese way we left the table three quarters full.  Service was excellent.  So why have I awarded a 4 not a 5. Firstly the price is so high. I knew what I was letting myself in for so it was not a surprise but it is ridiculous. Our lunch for two was over \u00a3200. In my case this was a justifiable business expense but I wouldn't dine here on anything but a special occasion.  Second while the service was good my guest and I both found we could not understand anything the waiting staff said. None of the five or six people who spoke to us were native English speakers - no problem you might think. But this is a nosey restaurant and an unusual and unfamiliar menu that needs some explanation. We did fine but every time something was brought to the table the staff would explain it (great) we would ask for a repeat and then gave up - looking at each other and saying 'did you get any of that - no - me neither'. I think part of the problems is the staff are busy and they speak very fast saying what is to them very familiar things.

I would recommend arriving early to have a drink at the bar because although the bar is usually packed it's worth the view.  The room is very nicely decorated with big ceilings. If you can, I might ask for a table at a window because there are quite a few tables in the middle with not as good views.  The view is great but certainly doesn't over shadow the amazing food. The menu is a little confusing at first as it s amid of Brazilian, Peruvian and Japanese but the waiter was very helpful and went right through the menu explaining the various dishes and their origins. We ordered our wine and after quite some time the waiter came back saying he didn't have the wine we ordered and suggested another wine which happens but it was a little annoying as our first two dishes had already arrived at this point. The dishes mostly come out quite quickly by the way.  We had 8 dishes between 3 (and two deserts) and that was about enough. We were nicely full after it.  The scallop seviche was amazing to taste - full of flavor and a bit different. It looked amazing also. Black cod miso was some of the most succulent pieces of fish I've had and although it was a little sweet which is not to my taste it was really good and I enjoyed it immensely.  After four dishes there was a change of staff and our waiter introduced a new a waiter and said he would be looking after us, unfortunately he didn't really look after us and we were waiting a long time for the next four dishes. We didn't mind as we were there for a nice long lunch and in fact it was a good thing but less patient guests may not be happy with similar service.  The next four dishes arrived which was mostly sushi and sashimi and the samba rolls. All looked and tasted amazing and really some of the best sushi I've had in London.  The location and food are simply amazing and although the staff and service were slightly patchy over all both were also good.

I don't understand why places like this don't keep any walk-in tables in their main restaurant space. The staff member who told us was very offhand and unapologetic - almost as though we were interrupting his day.  We decided to get a drink at the bar while we waited to see if we would be able to get a table. We waited for about 20 minutes and nobody offered to take our coats or seat us elsewhere.  We ended up sitting at the sushi bar and ordered a few dishes, including two of the black cod. We also had Diet Cokes, which came flat with very little ice. When our dishes arrived, there was only one black cod. We had to wait while they processed the other one. The waitress who served us was very sweet and accommodating, but her colleagues barely smiled at all. The food was excellent and I cannot fault it. I can understand why people may not worry about the service when the food is so good!  However, it felt like a lot of other tourist destinations - when most people only visit once, they don't care about giving an all-round experience.", "date_of_review": "6 February 2016"}

When we arrived the table was not ready and we went to the bar area for a drink. The bar area was very full with nowhere to sit. We ordered drinks and after a further wait of approx 15 minutes were called to our table. The restaurant is very modern looking and has good views of London. Our waiter introduced himself and explained the menu, he was knowledgeable about the menu and happy to make suggestions when asked. He took our order and advised that the sommelier would soon be over to take any drink order. We ordered our wine and the plates of food soon started to arrive. As each dish was presented at the table, the waiter explained what it was. The food was delicious and well presented. We finished off the evening with coffees and final drinks.  In all I would recommend SushiSamba, the staff are professional and pleasant and take time to look after you. My only other comment is that the restaurant was extremely busy on the Friday night that we visited, with the bar area feeling over crowed and the general vibe being quite young and vibrant. I am sure that is is to be expected and quite normal for a Friday night in London, however my suggestion for those wishing for a quieter experience may wish to go during a week night.", "date_of_review": "8 February 2016"}

Once we did head up we couldnt go to the restaurant floor but had to go to the bar floor instead, however no-one seemed to know we where there - we were told we would be called when our table was ready and our drinks at the bar could be charged to the table bill, not the case, we had to pay for them seperately when one of our party who had been running late was taken straight to the restaurant and called to see where we were! Once we got to the right floor and went to check our coats and bags into the cloakroom the attendant got halfway through dealing with us before stopping to deal with another customer, one assumes they were more important than us, our complaints ignored completely. Had this not been a business lunch and my boss insisted we stay as our clients had not witnessed the problem, I would have happily walked away at that point. Fortunately the staff inside the restaurant were a lot better but sadly the quality of the setting is not. Not sure if the decor is intended to look 'shabby chic' but in the end looks simply cheap and tired, added to the small tables for the style of eating the experience is pretty dismal. As for the view, pretty sure there is one but a lot of the tables really dont get to see much of it and you would have to intrude into other table spaces to actually see it. The food? Great....really great. We opted for the 'sampler' style dishes, a steady stream of different bite sized dishes to share and too many good ones to remember.

The restaurant looks top notch and the view (including the elevator ride) is incredible however we left disappointed which was such a shame. The main reason was the service was bad and when you're paying a lot of money you expect it to be good. We had a late lunch sitting at 3.45pm and during the service they clearly changed staff and we were unfortunately forgotten - the waitress that occasionally did attend our table made us feel like we were an annoyance! The food was good but not excellent - living in Melbourne we are spoilt for good Japanese food and this just didn't stand out as we had hoped. I will say - we had the prawn tempura and this was by far my favourite dish I would probably still go back just for this dish (but just to the bar) and the edamame was great. The other dishes that we had (black miso cod, tuna seviche and samba London sushi rolls) were good but not great. In my opinion the black miso cod at Nobu is better and the Samba London sushi rolls were small and a little uninspiring.  One other thing that I did not like is that 12.5% service charge is automatically added to the bill - I know that this is standard practice for US restaurants but it's not something I like - I will always tip if the service is good but given the sullen waitress was the one who eventually brought the bill I didn't feel comfortable telling her I wanted it taken off so we just paid it even though it was definitely not deserved. In conclusion, Sushi Samba is great to experience for the view and settings but if your main driver is the food quality and service I would say there is better for far less elsewhere in central London.", "date_of_review": "10 January 2016"}

We'd booked a table, dressed up according to the webpage suggestions, but wasn't sure about the entrance. When asking her, very clear that she was the porter, if this was the entrance to SushiSamba she said, in a very superior voice: \"You are not welcome! One need to have a table booked.\"... O.M.G!!!  Well, that goes without commenting... Just appalling. why we just didn't leave I don't know to this day, because that welcome really affected the whole evening.  Very \"spacy\" elevator ride up to the restaurant and bar! Supercool outdoor bar, nice restaurant, Absolutely nothing to complain about the food (nothing exceptional though). Supernice cocktails and stunning desserts. But of course it all comes with a fairly edgy bill as well... Only thing to mark is that the whole restaurant was very dark. Too dark to be able to read the menus (we still have our eye sight in order ;-)) and what worse is too dark to even experience the food with our eyes. Although that was in itself a quite interesting experience. Just to use all the taste senses to experience what we ate. Well, replace that rude women at the door and it will be an experience well worth the money.", "date_of_review": "7 January 2016"}

The lift up was really exciting, and the interior of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. The view on the 39th floor was amazing. The main dining room was airy, spacious and very modern. We were taken to our table near the window which meant we could have a good view of the city.  Obviously it's important to understand that this restaurant isn't cheap, so we took that with a pinch of salt. We ordered several things off the menu, including sashimi, nigiri, a couple of rolls, a couple of starters and one of their grilled meat dishes. The rolls were hit and miss; we could have lived without them. The sashimi and the nigiri were great, and you could tell the fish was of very high quality. The stand out dish was the lamb robato; if you go, please order this.  Yes, the food was great, but the service did not match up. It all felt very impersonal and slightly rushed. Perhaps everyone had a heavy New Year's party the night before, I don't know, but the servers were all quite cold and quick to move us onto the next thing.  I would say visit SushiSamba for the view, the interior of the restaurant, and to a certain extent, the food.

We had the belly pork, black cod, terriaki chicken and also the beef and chorizo dish along with a side of sticky white rice. All were cooked to perfection and the flavours were amazing. I would recommend any of the dishes.  We also had the passion fruit cake to share at the end of the night which was brought out with a candle / happy birthday message as it was my birthday at midnight. The staff were attentive, friendly and knowledgable and they also moved us to a window seat when one was available.

Located on the 38th floor of the Heron Tower, the views from the bar, the terrace and the restaurant are sensational - however, I phoned prior to our visit when I realised there was an exterior glass-walled lift, which I just couldn't have coped with. Without hesitation, I was told I could use the staff lift and when we arrived, Jacob, the charming restaurant manager, came down to the ground floor reception specially to accompany me up to the restaurant. Nothing was too much trouble and he did the same to go down when we left. My daughter took the outside lift, which was a great experience in itself. Our waiter was equally helpful, attentive and friendly, explaining anything on the menu and recommending dishes without being at all intrusive. We were made to feel very comfortable so took our time to enjoy the atmosphere, the cocktails and the food and were not rushed at any time. Everything we ordered was delicious and beautifully presented - cocktails, tempuras, lamb chops, poussin and sushi rolls highly recommended. We were lucky to have enjoyed the restaurant's stunning views on such a bright, sunny day for December. A great experience - not cheap but certainly worth it for a special occasion.

The view going from the lift in the Heron Tower is different to many that you see from other buildings in London (in a good way!) We were given a great seat by the window, the view looks to Stratford and Olympic Park. The service was attentive and our server was very helpful in explaining the way the menu works and giving his recommendations. He recommended five dishes, a mixture of small plates,large plates and sushi. Portion sizes were very big and we were full after a small plate and tiger maki!  The downside was that we were not allowed to package the leftovers, I wouldn't normally mind, but it means we left a whole portion of teriyaki chicken as we were just too full to eat it.  I was very impressed by the taste of the food itself and has probably shot up as one of my favourite restaurants in London,I will definitely be back (if I can get in!)", "date_of_review": "20 December 2015"}

I have been to 5 star resturants that have not been as rude, I can undestand if I came in shorts and a tank top you may not want me but I was presentable. you have lost a customer and my money so I decided to find another sushi resturant nearby and I went in with no quarrel and had a nice meal.

Great view, nice atmosphere, and lovely food. The trouble is the wait. The service was very slow. It got to the stage where we were all looking around trying to catch someone's eye. Course came in dribs and drabs. It was the same with the wine service. We ordered a bottle but, after our first half glass after tasting it was put in a shared ice bucket out of reach. We waited and waited for someone to come and refill our glasses. At one point I thought about getting up and helping myself, but decided to wait. I was also put off by a comment from the waiter. When taking our drinks order he asked whether we wanted still or sparkling water. I asked for plain tap water (the water in London is usually fine). I think he might have been trying joke, but his reply was \"As long as I get a good tip\" I've never heard that said before, and I felt extremely uncomfortable. In the end the tip was included, so he must have been trying to make light of the matter, but it felt wrong.

We had requested a window table and, although this wasn't promised, we were very pleased to see that this request had been granted when we arrived. The views from the restaurant are stunning, even in the rain. It's just a shame we could not get out onto the terrace to truly appreciate them. The menu was quite daunting on first look, as the Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian blend can seem quite confusing, but the staff were very forthcoming in recommending options, all of which were delicious. We ordered about 12 dishes between 5 of us, followed by dessert, which was more than enough food. Each dish was exceptional, beautiful tasting and well presented. The ceviche and black cod miso are a must! Cocktails were delicious. The only negative is that drinks are priced above average even for a London restaurant, in my opinion. Waiting staff were attentive with regards to the food, but the drinks orders took some time and our first order was incorrect (one cocktail arrived with alcohol for a non-alcohol drinker!).

So sushi samba next time your manager has this problem get him to 1 check with our waiter who had been happily been pouring our wine all night to see if we had been naughty and perhaps 2/ don't put the ice bucket with wine 8 feet away from table it is supposedly for and dont leave it by the table it is not meant for and when you are that busy make sure the customer is aware so if the wine is taking a while to be poured the guest don't help themselves to the wrong wine ! Rant now over I do love this place the food is stunning the cocktails are great but the manager with the black earring learn how to do the job with sensitivity or try a new career .The staff didn't get the \u00a380 tip from us which is a shame as all the other staff were great, bit guilty about that but on this occasion it just wasn't right .", "date_of_review": "9 December 2015"}

The waiter was a bit snappy when we asked things such as \"we are still waiting for our first drinks\" he replied \"yes!!!

I thought fair enough, it's a Monday and were not in a rush for anything. It came to 7.20pm and I hadn't heard anything so I went to ask what's happening with our table - SushiSamba explicitly mention in their booking confirmation email that if you don't show up after 15min, your table will be given to someone else etc - the lady at reception said a huge group had been delayed and they were waiting for them to pay and then we would get our 2 seat table. I said ok, and how much longer will that be, she said 5-10mins. I said it's a shame You don't call the customer to let them know their table will be delayed or something - it's the least you expect from somewhere so famous and pricey too, it's not like there isn't enough staff around. And if that wasn't enough the staff member said it wasn't her fault the big table had run over and made us late, but she'd pass my feedback to her manager. I thought that was disrespectful as they take their timings and bookings so seriously. Anyway, by 7.30pm - 30 mins late - we were at our table.

This time, I booked 2 months in advance.  I knew it would not be a budget dinner, but it's not a place you visit every weekend. The food is a mix of Peruvian/Chilean + Brazilian + Japanese. Amazingly tasty, great presentation, and not \"sample sized\". Our waiter was a true expert. He offered his personal taste and recommended the \"best sellers\". I don't know if we could have gone for any better options, but what we had was superb (the tempura prawns we got for starters were to die for!)... and the views...  I absolutely recommend it.

We're big fans of Japanese and Latin American food and have been lucky enough to have eaten in some fantastic restaurants around the world, both high-end and low-end/street. Unfortunately, the whole experience of SushiSamba left us feeling underwhelmed and flat. The guy on the door at ground level was pleasant but as we were waiting for the lift (which was probably the most impressive part of the whole night) we were rudely frisked by security. Once we got up to the top, the views were great, especially of the Gherkin. I will say though, if you've ever been up the Shard, then you won't be as impressed with this view. Our table wasn't ready on time so we sat at the bar and had a couple of lovely cocktails. Because the weather was pretty horrific, the outside 'tree bar' wasn't really up and running, so we were stuck inside. The place had an air of chaos about it, lots of people sat or stood in a relatively small bar waiting for their tables. Once we finally got to our window table, I have to say that we weren't that impressed. Again, I think we'd been spoiled with the views from the Shard. Also, the general ambience of the place wasn't great. The music wasn't quite loud enough to give the restaurant a decent buzz. The vibe was lacking. Then came the food. What a disappointment. I can honestly say that the prices they charge must be for the 38th floor views because the food was standard at best. The Samba Rolls were very plain, the scallop cerviche was average. The service was ok, a bit slow but they were busy. All in all, the whole experience was so average that we ended up going to a much cheaper Japanese restaurant in Soho to fill ourselves up, after paying close to \u00a3150. If you're planning on coming for a romantic night out, there are much better options for similar prices in the Shard. Maybe this place is better for groups. If you're a foody and coming for a culinary experience then prepare to be disappointed. You can get the same food or better for a 1/3 price elsewhere.", "date_of_review": "29 November 2015"}

I should point out we didn't go too crazy on wine, (two bottles at the lower priced end of the wine menu, but it was lovely wine none the less). Some of the favourite dishes on our table were; the green bean tempura with aioli, crispy taquitos, yellowtail and avocado, pork belly, and of course the blackened cod! The sushi was also absolutely lovely. The atmosphere was really good as well, there was a real buzz all evening which ensured a good fun night all round. Even if I was trying to pick a fault I'd find it hard. I do wonder if some people arrive with sky high (maybe slightly unrealistic) expectations, especially when it's a special occasion?!

The restaurant is fantastic and the views amazing. We had a beautiful sunny day and it was the perfect place to be.  The cocktails are amazing but pricey. The food and especially desserts are creative and innovative and everything was delicious. On our second visit we were really looking forward to the amazing ribs we had enjoyed the first time, but we were really dismayed to see they had been dropped from the menu! Bring the ribs back!!  The only real negative was that the waiter wanted to hurry us along at the end of our meal as another booking was due. As a party of 2 we had originally been sat in the middle of the restaurant in a table for 4, but early on in the evening we had been asked if we'd like to move to a window view 2-seater table. We gladly obliged but it was disappointing that this meant we were rushed along at the end of the night. The waiter was really nice about it though and did offer us a glass of prosecco each to make up for the inconvenience, which was a nice gesture.", "date_of_review": "2 November 2015"}

At the table we gave our coats to the receptionist who took them in the cloakroom. Our waiter was gentle and funny. He explained us the menu and advised that food will arrive as it is ready. The restaurant offers a combination of japanese, peruvian and brazilian cuisine, therefore there is something for every taste.We ordered a fillet steak, pork belly, Samba London and ezo.

I took work colleagues from abroad for dinner last night and could not believe the low standard of waiting staff in the restaurant? Yes the view is amazing, decor super stylish and the food is impeccable but way over priced! I have eaten in the Miami branch and the service was on point. Our waiter had a serious attitude problem and made us all feel very uncomfortable from the minute we sat down. We waited 20 minutes for any form of acknowledgment, once we ordered it all went down hill. Many dishes were forgotten and we had to remind waiter of what was missing, cocktails ordered were also forgotten and no form of apology? Just an irritated face from the waiter as if we were bothering him ........ I had to ask 3 different waiters for the bill, I'm not sure what the issue is but all the staff but 1 were rude and lazy! Very cheap staff that obviously have had no real training? When you pay \u00a3350 for dinner you expect the best of the best! The focus is defiantly on cramping as many people as you can in the bars and getting them drunk! The restaurant needs to hire new staff or train the ones you have! Managment should know better, tourists may get caught up in the hype but I'm from London, well travelled and have eaten in the best of the best .... I know the difference! For this reason alone we will never return to this restaurant. When we left no one saw us off, they just all stood around in a line staring at us as if we were aliens? I swear 15 waiters just looking and watching my wife struggle to get the buggy out of the restaurant, not one waiter offered to help move chairs .... SHOCKING! Then with 1 lift down we waited 25 mins for a free lift, greeted by another rude security guy! Don't buy into the hype of this place as they clearly have not taken the customer service as top priority. For example; Food and service in Roka put this place to shame! I could list many more in London .....", "date_of_review": "7 November 2015"}

As I arrived early, I treated myself to a glass of rose, this was \u00a38.44 and I gave \u00a38.50 to the bar attendant; this employee decided to give me five pence change without any further explanation (?) regarding the missing one penny. I informed him that he short changed me and his face to my astonishment, was one of disbelief that I dared to ask for the correct change. Hi finally (after a while) gave me one penny out of his personal coin-purse without any apology. I was astonished with his behaviour and attitude, furthermore, I thought that talking in Italian with your guest waiting for service is incredibly rude but to then, talk about this guest in a very rude and ungracious manner was below the pale. I happened to speak Italian, but as I was a guest I did not want to create the fuss. The money was not the issue here; it is the perception that your staff project onto the client like me, and that is one of acceptable culture of dishonesty, rudeness, sloppiness etc. Very, very, sad indeed. With so many restaurant in this fabulous city of ours one is spoiled for choice.

After arriving slightly early, they asked us to wait at the bar area. They were around 20 min delayed in seating us, but we were rewarded for our wait with an excellent window table right in the corner of the restaurant. Our waiter was very friendly and he enthusiastically recommended a number of dishes for us. The suggestion is to order 5-7 items for a party of 2, unless you go for one of the \u2018large plates\u2019, in which case they suggest 2-3 additional smaller items. We went for the former option and mostly followed the advice of our waiter. I\u2019d rate our dishes as follows: Excellent \u2013 shrimp tempura, kobe gyoza. Very good \u2013 green bean tempura, lobster taquitos, yellowtail tiradito, black cod, \u2018el topo\u2019 sushi. Average \u2013 chicken teriyaki (this was too dry). Although we were quite stuffed by this point, we did try the \u2018Love from Rio\u2019 dessert, which was very good. Most of the dessert menu options sounded a bit strange, this was the only one that tempted us. We had mixed feelings about the service. In the beginning they were a bit too efficient. Items of food were delivered as separate courses, but 7 out of our 8 savoury items appeared in very quick succession. I couldn\u2019t help thinking this was driven by their stated 1.5 hour time limit on the table (1.5 hours, really!!). However, towards the end of the meal there was a dramatic shift and service became very slow. We waited ages for our 8th savoury item, as well as for dessert. Drinks orders were quite slow to be delivered throughout the meal. Having said that, all of the staff were really friendly and pleasant to deal with. We did end up spending over 2 hours at our table\u2026 The bill for our massive meal came to around \u00a3220, of which \u00a370 was spent on drinks. This felt like a fair price, given the venue. On the whole, we really enjoyed this outing. The food, d\u00e9cor and views far outshadowed the mixed service. I\u2019m sure I will return in future.", "date_of_review": "26 October 2015"}

After a frosty greeting we waited in the bar area until our table became available. We all ordered a cocktail. They were OK, mine was not well balanced.  Once seated we were quickly given menus and offered advice on what to order. The waiting staff were very friendly and attentive throughout the meal. The portions were very small and overpriced but very tasty. We had to wait for a sommelier when ordering the wine which felt a little pretentious, especially as they were just trying to up-sell overpriced sake. The wine was OK but again overpriced.

The room the restaurant in is beautiful with great views so it is very impressive for people who have not been here before. Some of the food is fantastic eg the rock shrimp tempura, black cod and the fish taquitos. However some of it is just odd. The ceviches are mostly liquid and vegetables with a small amount of fish. Larger meat portions are often dry.nd it is very very expensive, even for London. Service is mixed. Last time we were there and sat in the bar we had a great friendly and efficient waiter but too often service is distracted and too busy chatting to their friends to look after you properly. They also are apparently always sold out but every time we have been there throughout lunch there will be many tables empty. Still a good place to go when someone else is paying but would I go there with my husband for a great dinner? No", "date_of_review": "18 October 2015"}

After 1h of waiting up standing, one of the receptionists took us to the terrace and at some point, after being so cold outside I had a chat with the manager and the only table available for us after a hour and a half was on the Lounge, where the menu was not the same and much shorter.

Decided on great food with awesome nights views of London over dinner hence this restaurant. Yep, amazing views and delicious food (fusion of Japanese with a Tapas twist) true to its website...so looking forward to it then the customer experience began...  As an overseas visitor to this venue for first time, earliest booking was mid-August on Friday 11.15pm (booked about a month in advance via Opentable website) but happily booked timeslot as food reviews seemed great.  Email confirmations from restaurant tell you they will cancel if not arriving within 15 mins of timeslot (and if not confirmed when receiving email confirmation prior to day, slot gets reallocated ?!). We were in transit and only by chance, had wi-fi access late afternoon by train to check awaiting email sent day of reservation.. so had to call even though our booking had been confirmed via website ? hmmm. Only back to London that evening but arrived an hour earlier at 10pm to enjoy a few cocktails pre-dinner. Shame about the reception staff and waiters at outdoor bar.  Supper drinks/Cocktail hour: We struggled to get bar service, let alone a spare table ..it was Sunday at 10pm. Two waiters chatting to each other then just looked at me without a word - when I dared to interrupt to order a cocktail, arrogant attitude continued until we waited for cocktails about 15 minutes later (between chatter) - guess customers seemed an inconvenience to them (and better/quicker service at a local pub to be honest), bar tables scattered with empty cocktail glasses/full ashtrays .. we should have seen the signs. Feel sad for the owner as staff represent the \"face\" of the restaurant that could make or break such a place if it weren't for the views/venue here. Our dinner experience: expected a little longer dining sitting than just over hour when the kitchen closed and we were last 2-3 tables there around 12.30am). For what we paid, seemed one of the most expensive even for London/Australian standards. Where it mattered though, once in the restaurant floor itself did make up for initial experience - great vibe, amazing views/ dishes and attentive floor waiter/staff. Just could not shake off the attitude of booking/reception desk staff prior to getting there - as the initial \"face\" of the restaurant - knowing we had arrived early and upon polite enquiry, still did not seat us at our scheduled timeslot even though many tables starting to become available by 11pm - turned us off the remaining night's high expectations/experience for us really. Once inside the restaurant - our table/drinks waiters were wonderful - so attentive, polite, friendly (didn't mind us asking for photo) and professional service until the end.  We were one of the last tables by 12.30am and felt a bit rushed as kitchen was closing by then. For what we paid for (even double tipped not realising they added a service charge to bill in the fine print) and just a little over an hour of dining .. we couldn't help but be disappointed.  Overall, if you don't care about staff with \"booking\" attitude, \"fashion police\" staff out front (is this a club?) and manage to avoid select few staff (who seem to think it was a privilege to be graced by their presence) and just focus on amazing London views, great waiters once in dining room to impress us for the time we dined there and the food itself was a quite special fanfare.  Just felt a bit rushed as would have ordered more with time permitting and for same cost, can get a full Degustation menu for more than an hour of fine dining elsewhere.  Romance killed by the loud music. Expected some dance floor to open up any moment. First ever dinner reservation at a restaurant for 11pm (and probably the last) so recommend booking earlier to avoid disappointment if you are game enough to take your chances to avoid feeling second class to the staff.", "date_of_review": "17 October 2015"}

With the magical views of London becoming more apparent as you ascend! Once in the restaurant we were greeted by a lovely lady whom advised that if we prefer to dine in the main restaurant we were welcome to do so an hour after out arrival. We were shown to the beautiful terrace bar which had a beautiful lit tree and stunning views over the city. The cocktails were interesting with very unusual mixes. At our time of dining, we were attended to promptly with continual top ups of our wine! Our waiter was extremely knowledgable on the menu and made some great suggestions of food to chose as it can feel a tad overwhelming. One of our dishes was the black cod, beautifully cooked and just melted your mouth. We had chose 4 dishes amongst 2 which was an ample amount! In fact we couldn't finish it all but every single dish as delicious as the other. Our bill came in at over 100 however was all worth it considering our food and drink choices.

My husband called him over to explain how rude he was to me which left him flustered. After watching all the waiters and managers running frantically and returning good these Arabs weren't happy about, the floor manager who was on duty on September 30th came over and apologised about the waiters behaviour,but wait it doesn't end there, his apology was so insincere that as he was talking to us he kept looking at the Arab guys next to us!you would think after this extreme rudeness, the 12.5% discretionary service charge would be waivered or a small gesture on the dessert front but no no no!

I discovered that the bar organises Sunday Jazz evenings so my boyfriend booked a table, asking to be at the bar and explaining it was only for drinks on Sunday 27th September. The website described the dress code as \"Casual Elegance\" so we dressed appropriately. Well, the two things that went as planned were the view and the band. As for the rest... We arrived and, even though we confirmed the booking an hour before, the waitress couldn't find the name on her listing. She asked to see the confirmation email once we were in the middle of the bar and told him we were supposed to be in the lounge and not in the bar - even though we asked to be at the bar in the first place. We didn't want to be in the lounge because it was quite far from the band and very empty. She found us a table on the side, next to the bar, mostly because the bar was...almost empty.  At the complete opposite of what the website says, the dress code for the bar was more \"tourists & co\" with a lot of people wearing trainers, dirty jeans and even football shirts. Not really what I was expecting.  As we were at a table next to the bar, we received several splashes and our table got knocked several times. Eventually, one waiter knocked our wine on to my dress. He barely apologised but the manager was very helpful and polite, offering to pay for the dry cleaning and brought us 2 glasses of wine.

I was really looking forward to this as we have visited here many time before and has been exceptional, now however its a shambles. It started off all wrong when we saw a long queue to see the hostess, and seeing everyone getting turned around to the already very busy bar. The hostess informed us that they are very busy and that our table will be ready in 15 mins LIE #1 We ordered 4 drinks at the bar costing 50 pound and 15 minutes later went to check with the hostess if our table was ready, she answered with the other guests are paying the bill, just give us a few minutes to get your table ready LIE#2 Another 15 minutes later we went to the hostess again to ask what was going on and were greeted by someone telling us they are very busy and getting the table ready, and offered to get us a drink, nice gestures but too late to be honest. LIE#3 Around 22:30 we were taken to our table finally, ordered a bottle of water, some wine and the food.  Surprisingly, the food appeared instantly, I thought there would be quite a wait as the place was so busy. As one of the dishes we ordered the Churrasco Rio Grande, which we knew would be coming last. We ate some rice with the previous courses so in anticipation for the Rio Grande I asked our server Tareq to bring us more rice to enjoy with the meat platter, he responded with no problem. The rice did not arrive until there was 1 sliver of meat remaining on the stones, so naturally I told the server that its too late we have finished. He ran off to get Tareq who stormed back to the table and said \"You only ordered this when the rio grande was on the table\" LIE #4 How rude of waiter to speak to customers like that. Once the table was cleared we said we'd like to see the dessert menu, Tareq appeared and slammed them down so aggressively on the table he almost knocked over a glass of wine. Desserts were tasty but we quickly ordered the bill. On seeing the bill we were amazed to see we were charged for the rice as well as 2 bottles of water, we only ordered 1 so when we explained to Tareq, he angrily stated that we ordered two, when we see we hadn't he said he had opened 2 for us and kept one to the side we told him he should not have done that so he rolled his eyes and stormed off. 10 mins later he returned huffing and puffing with the bill. We swiftly paid and left. The worst experience in my life. I previously rated this place no1 in London. It has slumped a lot and I would not recommend anyone. Staff need training on how treat customers in this industry. Hostesses need trained on how to do their job and not lie to customers 3 times. Truly disgusting. I am so disappointed in this place it needs a totally revamp of their staff. Would give 0 stars if possible. Much better places to visit than this.", "date_of_review": "27 September 2015"}

Close to hopeless!", "comment": "We arrived a little earlier than we had booked for dinner. They said our table was not ready (even though the restaurant had only a few tables occupied) and I found the attitude poor.....they did not suggest we have a drink or show us anywhere. So we wondered into the outside bar and asked for a Bellini and a coke. I was advised by one of the barmen that the peach puree was \u201cnot very nice\u201d so I switched to a glass of champagne. A totally unnecessary wait of 5 minutes ensued while the barman had a chat with a member of staff and generally went slow....while I stood by the bar like a spare part. The bar was hardly busy.  My champagne, when it finally arrived was bordering on being warm and it tasted sweet and really nasty. I exchanged it for a glass of water to remove the foul taste. The barman apologised and tipped the contents of my champagne glass into an ice bucket right in front of me...as if this happens often. Perhaps it does? The house champagne that they serve by the glass is Bruno Paillard extra brut Premiere Cuvee, Reims....vile! They also have a blanc de blancs, Reserve Privee Grand Cru. Reims.....but I wasn't given a choice at the bar otherwise I would have gone for it.....although I doubt it is either much better or is served any colder! The funny part is that the wine list boasts, \" Sushisamba is proud to feature the largest collection of Bruno Paillard Champagne in the UK from the Maison de Champagne's Library collection.\" I'd keep quiet about that if I were them!  Bar tables were not clean. Why? I asked if they had any bar nibbles.....I received a blank look. I explained, \"crisps or nuts or olives?\" This 2nd barman gave me a one word answer....NO. By now he had my credit card and I had a Sushi Samba tab. Would they credit the unused, binned by barman, glass of champagne at end of dinner, I wondered? The views are great but that doesn't excuse poor service and possibly the worst glass of champagne I've ever tasted. Avoid it....whatever you do. I can't imagine why the Bellini could be so bad but if they used this horrible champagne instead of a decent Prosecco as they do at Harry\u2019s bar in Venice and most good bars, then no peach juice in the world would stand a chance of impressing.....the result would be blighted.  I had to find the receptionists to ask for our table after our appointed time otherwise we could have ended up being late for the theatre. I had told them where we were. That\u2019s twice these two ladies were pointless and useless. The view from the restaurant is good .....but you can't eat the view and plenty of other restaurants in London with far better food and service also offer good views. The loo wasn't great.....no tissues or paper to use to manually turn off the horrible water tap after washing hands so one recollects the germs. A friend, who owns a great up market chain of restaurants in the USA even has a tissue dispenser by the exit door to the loo (WC/toilet) for people who have just washed their hands to avoid touching the loo door handle...a great idea. Here there are no tissues or any sort of paper dispenser around door area or basins. The clientele vary.....some guys were shorts. Don't bother dressing up to come here.  The seating in the restaurant....all large leather chairs......very wide to accommodate wide people.....but also very hard and uncomfortable to sit on. Our stone table for two in the far right corner on entering the room was chipped all over. Above the diners is a high ceiling with lighting thick with dust.....i hope it doesn't fall off into the food.  My main course, very long strips of vegetables on top of a nasty green sauce which looked great and tasted vile. Also impossible to eat properly with chopsticks. The next course, billed as a \"large plate\" requiring, so I was told by our waiter, no extra vegetable dishes, was in fact small and more like an horderve that I was so hungry afterwards that I ordered a plate of Avocado Maki. What a surprise! AT LAST......something great....the avocado maki were the best I have ever seen or tasted anywhere in the world.....absolutely fantastic and for these alone, this restaurant will not receive a low score.  My wife left her vegetable tempura. They were really greasy....nowhere near as good as even at Yo Sushi! Her black cod was ok but nothing special. My vegan main was passable. They brought the wrong dish at first.....with an egg in the centre....not very vegan...even though it was ordered off their vegan menu. To have a menu for vegans is admirable...so why deliver the dish ordered WITH AN EGG IN THE MIDDLE OF IT? Vegans don\u2019t eat dairy products. This was another case of the staff being badly trained and useless. Too many are busy trying to be \u201ccool\u201d and failing miserably. This restaurant isn\u2019t \u201ccool\u201d but it is funny....in a 3rd rate sort of a way. A manager in a shiny blue suit then asked how we had enjoyed the food. I only got as far as my wife's starter being too greasy.....before he helpfully explained...going on and on to me, that tempura is \"fried in oil!\" really? Well fancy that. And 2 + 2 is 4. I know more about food and restaurants than this guy ever will. Then the waiter clearing the table dropped the chop sticks. We were at their Las Vegas branch at Christmas.....with a very annoying waitress. The Vegas version was fairly grim. Food-wise, this no better. The service here was barely passable.  Then my wife did something ever so brave...she ordered a desert. It was terrific. I think the management needs changing as all that happened is down to poor management. Wakey wakey Shimon, Matthew and Danielle who own this restaurant. I\u2019m sure you pay a fortune in rent to be at the top of The Heron......so perhaps pay the staff a little more and improve the service? That\u2019s a tip from someone who really knows! But my best tip is...don\u2019t bother. Go to Zuma if you want to a big bill but great food/service/atmosphere/everything....or Yo Sushi. Finally, due to desert (pudding) and the great Maki, I would have given the 2nd lowest score instead of the lowest.....but the doorman on the ground floor at the ropes, with his I-pad, is just so welcoming and helpful both on arriving and on leaving (he went to great pains to show us exactly, on his I-pad, where to walk to reach the Barbican Theatre (where we were due at 7pm to see Hamlet) that I\u2019m not even going to give the 2nd bottom score but will go one higher.

We had an 11.15pm booking - the dinner felt rushed as we had to get our order in by 11.30pm (we were ready to order straight away) and the dessert course had to be in by a certain time. The late time wasn't our preference, it was the only available slot we had. However, if a restaurant is going to start a meal sitting at 11.15pm, don't expect it to be over by 12.30am.

Firstly, the location is fantastic, the Heron Tower is awesome with its lift overlooking the street below and being so up high, the restaurant has ridiculous views of London! Service was phenomenal, hostesses were friendly and the restaurant design is gorgeous. We had the fillet steak (fantastic, although small), two rolls which consisted of the best maki I have ever had (and I have had loads of sushi all over the globe). The fish was so fresh and just melted in your mouth. The maki rolls we had were:  tokyo sky tree and the tiger maki.  The drinks were fabulous (had sake and a cocktail). They have an extensive Sake menu that's for sure! we went onto the terrace for the drinks after our dinner and it overlooked London with stunning views up on the 38th floor of the Heron Tower. It was a romantic setting and definitely finished our night off wonderfully.  The dessert wasn't the best but they personalised it for my boyfriend's birthday.  Definitely try the vegetable tempura (seriously some of the best I've had as well). The onlt complaint is that as a student it's quite pricey so couldn't go again since then. However, if you have the money to spend on a good meal, this is a no-brainer. You must try this place.

This is a rare example of a venue earning its one star rating. I went here last week with some friends to celebrate a birthday. We were really only here for a couple of drinks before dinner at a proper restaurant somewhere else. But oh boy were those drinks overpriced! I complained about the price of my girlfriend's Ashahi. \u00a37 when you can get 8 of the same bottles for a tenner in Tesco. Now I know it's London but let's not be silly here. As I was expressing my disdain, Slick on the cramped sofa next to me eyed me with disapproval, as though to say \"here be a country mouse come to visit the city.\" He was trying to get in the knickers of a young debutante so was probably trying to impress her with the 'I'm a man of wealth and refined tastes spiel.' Regardless, my partner and I are on very good salaries, but we're not stupid with our money and wouldn't throw it away when we can get the same product for a fraction of the price elsewhere. Ashahi is Ashahi and the taste is consistent. Cocktails were nice but massively overpriced at \u00a313 each, especially considering that they were mostly made up of crushed ice. Drank it in a few minutes. Food from the sushi grill was likewise overpriced, tiny, and there was no table to eat it on, which resulted in my spilling oil all over my trousers. After trying and failing to pay for a long time, we finally got a cocktail waitress to bring us our bill. When she found out we wanted to split it she flew into a rage and shouted \"You should have told me this when you ordered!\" Erm.. we did. Anyway, after grumbling for another 5 minutes and completely ruining the atmosphere, we paid our \u00a3200+ something bill (we'd barely ordered anything!) and swiftly departed because we no longer felt safe. The waitress looked like she wanted to stave our heads in with her serving tray. The views are quite good but good luck getting a spot near the windows. Greedy management lets too many people in at once.", "date_of_review": "19 August 2015"}

The outside bar was really busy, and sheltered, so a great place to come just for a drink. The price was kind of what we expected, but so expensive I went 'dutch' with my husband !

I picked Sushi Samba having had previous great experience. It was a hot summer day so I wore flip flops with smart leggings and smart top. My sister also wore a form of flip flop too. Upon arrival we were told abruptly to 'wait' by the doorman and weren't let in for a couple of minutes (not sure why). We then came to the door and told him our booking and time (we were about twenty minutes late due to train delays but my Aunty had already arrived about ten minutes early for our booking and was sitting at the table waiting). He checked his iPad which had all the tables on it and tried to tell us that there wasn't a booking in our name. We explained that my Aunty was waiting upstairs already and we definitely did have a booking... he then looked us up and down and told us that I couldn't come in anyway because I was wearing flip flops. He wasn't aplogetic or pleasent about telling me at all though, you could tell that he got complete and utter satisfaction out of not letting me in over my shoes and was just all round unpleasant and arrogant with no reason to be. As a result, we politely argued it and explained that we had had the booking for two months and it was a really important one. He rudely shot us down and said that it was the dress code (fair enough). He then went on to say it was actually health and safety reasons as if i slipped and tripped and cracked my head open I could then sue them. I personally think it is a bit of a ridiculous rule as anybody could sip over and crack their head open anywhere and sue for it. What bothered us most is that he just absolutely loved telling us. We waited to the side to discuss what we were going to do about it and then watched him also rudely tell some other people they weren't allowed in due to their footwear. My sister was also wearing sandals, just some casual ones but as hers had a bar across the top of her foot, she was allowed in. Bizarre really as she was just as likely to 'slip over' in hers as i was in mine. We pleaded again but he was adament to not let us in. Not once did he say sorry. No shops were open as it was a Saturday night so there was nowhere for us to possibly buy some appropriate shoes and he knew that. However, luckily my sisters office was two minutes down the road and she had some spare heels under her desk which we got and came back. Oh boy was he not happy to see us again! I think he thought he had won and we had gone home. Anyway, he finally let us in about twenty five minutes later down the line and we finally sat down. But the whole experience was tainted by the unpleasant doorman. All of the other staff are lovely and helpful but still. Funnily enough, when we sat down, my Aunty had also thought he was unpleasant.  I understand that Sushi Samba has a dress code & health and safety rules but there is a way in which you tell somebody this. Especially at a place like this, you would expect the best service. The doorman was just a doorman, not the owner of Sushi Samba... so no reason to be so arrogant!  However, putting all this beside, the food was delicious as always, i can't fault it. But when you come across such unpleasant staff, it really taints the experience. The doorman needs taking down a peg or two. He does Sushi Samba no justice at all!", "date_of_review": "18 August 2015"}

At 9pm (our reservation time), we went back to Sushi Samba and were surprised to find we had to wait half an hour to be seated, despite booking 6 weeks in advance. Unhappy and hungry, it was very annoying to see others go into the restaurant before us (perhaps they thought we were young and weren't going to spend a lot of money - when actually I was attending the restaurant to see if it was suitable for clients).

Very attentive, friendly and smiley and plenty of staff running around keeping busy.Only aspect of service I didn't like was the team at the front door are a bit like \"are you deserving of being here\" in their attitude. Food was very good, varied & fresh, The 3 different cuisines thing works well. Different enough without being too so. Going as a small group (we were 4) prob best recommended as it is a bit tapas style, so sharing a variety of menu items, but not amongst too many, works. Not easy to book coz it is still very popular. To get a table for 4 we had to go 2 months out. A bit Chichi, all round but a nice experience and happy we went. There is plenty on the menu that is in a sensible price range but, given you need to order several items each and the wine list is good but high end, don't expect anything other than a large bill.

He then even went through the whole menu for my partner too. When I booked the table I added on the bottom that it was my boyfriends birthday but didn't really have an expectation as I understand what a busy restaurant it is. However to my surprise they have is a window seat without request and a small dessert with happy birthday on it and a candle free of charge!

When we arrived they had given away our table. This is understandable as lateness can have a knock on effect on other bookings, but they should have contacted us. Instead they said they offered a table that would be available in 10-30mins. Fine.... So we went to the bar for cocktails. The bar wasn't busy but the two bar men failed to serve us. When we asked one of them , he was dismissive and insisted that he was serving in the correct order.  They said they would come and find us but after about 25min we went to enquire about our table. Fortunately the hostess seated us after we had to enquire. The cocktail that I ordered at the table (samba sour) left me wishing I had ordered something else. It was smooth and sweet, but the flavour was indistinct, and the eggy foam had strange smell. My friends seemed happy with there's.  The food we received was well presented and the flavours were...nice. We waited for our last sushi roll (\"El topo\") to come out of the kitchen, and after we enquired with waiter, he insisted that it had already come to the table and we had eaten it. He didn't check with the kitchen. So we ordered a couple more dishes, but soon after \"El topo\" arrived at the table, with our additional orders. We would have not ordered these additional items if we new it was going to eventually come. It was however quite delicious.  We asked for the desert menu on several occasions but instead of getting it, about 20-30mins later they asked us to leave as another guest was waiting for our table. We hadn't been there for long and if we knew we has been given a short time limit we would have gone somewhere else. In summary, there is a discrepancy between the service and standard of food, and the pricing.

If you are afraid of heights, like myself, you may want to consider finder another point of interest with great views. The first challenge was the elevator ride, which is completely see-through and moves VERY FAST! If you are good with heights, you'll love the views with the ride up to the 38th floor.  The decor is very modern, creative and colourful. Upon attendance it was extremely busy and we were unable to access the outside area at all. However, there were still amazing views through the floor to ceiling glass windows that surrounded the bar. After waiting a while at the bar, we were finally served and decided to get a cocktail each. It was only affordable to buy one drink, as they were very over priced! Although the barman took time in creating the cocktails, i can't justify spending this much on each one.  There was plenty of overall floor space but very limited seating. There were only a few places to rest your drink down, aside from the bar. This left us standing and shouting at each other, in order to hear our own voices. SS was a nice one-off luxury to soak up the night atmosphere and admire the London landscape at night.

I was quite excited as I heard so many wonderful reviews about this place. Upon entering the restaurant from the lift, it was very unclear as to where we should go to check in. Once we arrived at the front of house, we were not greeted. Once finally acknowledged (5 mins later) with no smile or a politeness we were told our table was taken as we were a few minutes late so we would have to wait at the bar. Drink in hand we were eventually seated 15 mins later. No one offered to take our jackets which I thought was pretty poor service. Our waitress was sincere and accommodating however, the food was below par. I ordered the scallop ceviche which was ok, but the sauce it was in was far too acidic. We also ordered salt and pepper calamari which was under seasoned and tasteless to say the least. Overall, the staff were pretty snooty except our waitress and the food wasn't what I was expecting considering the price tag.

As a small group we ate and then drank cocktails outside. I liked the venue - fairly spacious in the restaurant although the bar area was too busy - people pushing past you from the stairs / going to restroom / bar, just like being in a corridor. Restaurant itself i thought was nice. Staff OK, menus a bit confusing, portions v small and stupidly priced really (\u00a312-\u00a315 for a say 5 small chopstick pinches), although not as badly priced as the wine where you struggle to find anything less than \u00a350 a bottle. However some of the food was great, recommend black cod, the lamb, coconut rice, fillet steak, tempura prawns.Net net i thought the place was good but slightly over-trading, at circa \u00a380 a head (excluding post meal cocktails!) for a cocktail, some small plates and wine it's probably 20% more pricey than it should be all things considered. Not really a romantic place (most views from bar and restaurant of the less attractive parts of town) - good for small groups of 4 or 6 I'd say.

Despite there being a large group of what appeared to be business people at the next table, our waiter didn't once neglect us whilst also serving them. The manager also popped by to help us choose from the menu. The food - a unique fusion of Asian and South American - was simply stunning. We chose several small tapas and nothing disappointed. Each was served as it became ready and was served in a variety of beautiful dishes. The fillet steak and tempura prawns were highlights, as were the tuna taquitos. After dinner we had a drink in the outside bar with its wonderful orange tree (only slightly ruined by all the smokers). We then had one last drink inside, sitting on stools against the window and looking down on the Gherkin and other famous London landmarks. It's not cheap.

Unfortunately however, our visit was severely tainted by the service, which was decidedly rude and unprofessional. The issue was a small one: we were served a dish that we hadn't ordered, of which we informed the server. However, instead of simply removing the dish, the waitress who took our order came over and insisted that we had definitely ordered it (we hadn't - it was a misunderstanding), and would not take it away! After she went away (dish still on our table), a third server came over to the table and tried to convince us to take the dish, saying that he would 'just leave it there... maybe you'll change your mind'. At this, we explicitly requested it to be taken back to the kitchen. And finally, they gave in. This was all extremely embarrassing and by the end of it our waitress basically didn't engage with us at all. We were never asked how our meal was and indeed all she did was clear up once we had finished, ask if we needed anything else (we didn't) and then said, rather brusquely, 'Just the bill, then?' Er, what? Now, this all seems rather ridiculous; however I have honestly never experienced such rude service in my life.

All of the food we ordered exuded flavour and you could tell how passionate the waiters were about the food, which is always a good sign.

Enjoyed the Shrimp Tempura and Teryiaki Poussin especially. Lots of cocktails to try (but these will quickly bump up the cost of your meal!) and our desserts were delicious. The best thing about the restaurant, however, is the view. On a lovely sunny afternoon, the view across the City, out towards southern England was amazing. We had lunch and weren't hurried along. My only disappointment was the bar. It's actually very enclosed and doesn't enjoy the views that the restaurant has. Everyone there seemed to be smoking and even though it was outside, the smell of cigarettes was nasty and spoilt it for me.

I had called to inform them of our delay and expected to be turned away upon arrival, or having to wait for another available table, but when we arrived we were immediately brought to our table without any fuss. Maybe because it was \"only\" lunch and they weren't that full.  Have to say, the waitress we had was overly friendly and helpful, so no complaints there. However, they are not so friendly when you book over the phone and go through their call center.  The dishes we ordered were delicious, but the food and drinks were extremely overpriced. So fully agree with others' comments. Don't understand how so many people have no problem with spending so much money. Guess that's just London.

However everything went downhill from there.  We were seated at what must be the only table in that restaurant without a view and we were facing the open robata grill, which made a very hot day much hotter. We had to continually flag staff down to be given menus, to order drinks and to place a food order. Considering how many staff were walking around the restaurant (with the obligatory cool-restaurant FBI earpiece) I was amazed at how little attention they were giving the guests. Mention must go, however, to the sommelier, who was wonderful and seemed to be the only person to notice we were in need of attention.  The food when it arrived tasted good. I cannot deny that. The portions were disappointingly small. The descriptions of the dishes from the staff were hurried and mostly hard to hear and it really felt like no one cared about the food at all.  Obviously this restaurant is expensive and we knew that going in. We probably expected that you would be paying for the view as well. It was still galling to receive the enormous bill at the end of the meal given how poor both the service and view were. It's such a pity as I think the menu could have been really interesting and the potential for a fun evening was there, it all just seemed badly executed. ", "date_of_review": "15 July 2015"}

We were initially concerned about the dress code as I had heard through other friends that diners dress up as if they are going to a bar/club. As you can imagine, I was a little worried as my friend and I had dedicated that whole day to shopping and I didn't particularly fancy wearing heels and a dress. I ended up wearing smart, dark wash jeans, a white work top with smart flats. Whilst I was let in OK, I did feel very under dressed compared to most other diners there who were dressed in suits and smart dresses. The venue itself is very impressive. When you arrive at the Heron Tower, you need to use the glass lift to get to Sushi Samba which provides an amazing view of the city and certainly gives the experience a wow factor from the start. Unfortunately, our table didn't give us the best view, but the place was completely full so I understand they couldn't have moved us. The service was amazing - our waiter was very attentive and detailed, but not intrusive. We got a \"hello\" from every staff member we passed on our way in which was a nice touch. The food was excellent albeit very pricey. We ordered and shared the black cod, shrimp tempura and some sushi. Neither of us ordered any alcohol, yet we became very aware that our bill was already going to be high, so we stopped ordering despite feeling we could have eaten more!  In all, I'm glad I tried this place.

Having said that, we found it well worth the price. The location is spectacular - situated near the top of Heron Tower, the cavernous main hall feels grand, with large glass walls providing a high altitude view. There's also an al fresco section and a separate outdoor bar area.  We arrived for an early lunch and were able to get a corner table with a view (sadly the North London view on offer on that side of the building was a bit bland). Tables are spaced out enough to have a private conversation, but there's still a lively atmosphere when the restaurant fills up.  The service from our waitress, Ruta, was superb. Friendly and attentive without being overbearing, she offered knowledgeable advice on the menu.  The menu is interesting as it is divided into different regional sections for Japanese, Brazilian, and Peruvian dishes. They are mostly small dishes that are easy to share. Virtually everything we ordered was excellent, apart from the just 'fairly good' lamb chops. The shrimp tempura and black cod were highlights, as was the dessert combo. Also worth trying are the custom cocktails on offer. Again, not cheap, but considering the location definitely above par for the price. The lychee cooler is one I'd come back for! This was one of our best dining experiences in recent memory.

He just told us not enough seeing that we have ordered a few big plates for sharing. In the end, we could not finish even half of the beef.

The more disappointing thing was that when we asked for taking the left-over food away and complained about the service, unlike any other good restaurants we experienced before, the manager gave a lot of explanations instead of simply apologizing and letting it go.

Waitress collecting glasses just pushed me out the way to get past with no apology. Cocktails were mediocre, nothing spectacular. After 40 minutes, the table still wasn't ready but after some persistence we were eventually seated, almost an hour after we arrived and we were given a window seat which was lovely. The waiter was helpful with suggestions, all of which were pretty good and the food arrived pretty soon after ordering. The lobster taquitos and black cod were both particularly tasty. We were still hungry at the end so we ordered another plate of samba rolls. Surprisingly when we initially ordered our food arrived very quickly despite the restaurant being completely packed. However ordering one extra plate of samba rolls when the restaurant was clearing meant a half hour wait, which we eventually got fed up with and cancelled. A minute later the rolls arrived, although we were told that we wouldn't be charged for them due to the long wait. Desserts were disappointing.

But he would allow many others to get in right in front of us. When I questioned his decision, he simply said \"they have been here before\". The door men in the past were quite polite, but now this group which cannot even speak proper English are very insulting. The tone of their language is also very uncultured. I am very surprised SushiSamba has let these guys be their front. Liverpool street is a very lively area and there are lots of other bars which are more welcoming. Will never b visiting this place again.", "date_of_review": "1 July 2015"}

Yes it's expensive, but food this good should be. I had quite a few of the small plates and some mixed sashimi, which was expertly prepared. Each dish was served at the perfect temperature (I'm quite fussy about that) and every bite had so much flavour. I particularly recommend the salt and pepper squid. The ambience was special, exclusive and the views of London really are something to experience.

The journey starts with being beamed up in the glass lift and soaring above the London skyline as you climb. It is a beautiful restaurant and bar area. Because it was such a lovely the day, the terrace bar and dining areas were full also. We were fortunate to get a table by a window with views across North and East London, w,onderful. There was a mixed crowd there, couples groups and friends, a few families and even two hen party groups. After having the menu explained, there was a longer than customary delay to take our order - and I am not the fastest person to make selections from extensive menus! I have to say other than this minor hiccup the service was extremely good and the floor manager also checked how how we were enjoying our experience and showed genuine warmth. But why are you here ultimately? The food. I suppose my comparisons, in terms of venue, ambience and pricing, is with the likes of Zuma and Nobu Berkeley. Similar places which will strip your wallet of a large sum for high-grade Japanese food, but where you have also had a high-grade gastronomic experience. I am afraid The food at Sushisamba simply does not hit those notes. We bookended our savoury dishes with the excellent lobster taquitos, but the other dishes we had were simply average. Salt and pepper squid had great textture but no fire and flavour; yellowtail tiradito was good but not the traditional style of tiradito with chopped fish so was more in sashimi form, which I love, but wanted something different hence choosing tiradito; pork belly was marginally dry; sea bass tempura large dish, the fish was nicely cooked but the tempura looked the crispiness and lightness one would expect; outside of the taquitos, the black cod was the highlight, soft, firm, perfectly cooked. Passion fruit cake dessert with green tea an chocolate grenache and raspberry sorbet was an assault on the eyes with the colour but lacked finesse and subtlety. When I go to a restaurant of this style and with these prices, I know I am in for an expensive haul, but I keep prolonging the ride through the menu because it is so thrilling and the highs are exhilirating. At Sushisamba, I was happy to stop the food ride and continue with the view.", "date_of_review": "27 June 2015"}

When we arrived, we got \"big-dogged\" and was told by the host that table was now being held for the chef's friend. When we got seated to a random table, now less then 4 people asked if we wanted to order drinks, in the first 10 minutes. An hour in, we ordered a couple drinks because they would not stop asking and we thought maybe there was a drink minimum. we got a couple of cups filled with crushed ice and little bit of water down fluid and a stick ($24USD). The waiter suggested and swore by the fried squid. It was crap. It reminded me or a bag of stale pork skins minus the seasoning. I also got some miso soup, which was the worst and most expensive miso soup I've ever had. We ordered some other appetizers, some steak think, pork belly, tempera shrimp; all pretty good, but not worth the cost at all. Also ordered 2 or 3 sushi rolls. Again, good, but not anywhere near worth the money. Service was pretty questionable too. It wasn't bad, just lackluster. Floaters would come around, but seemed bothered if we asked for something, and we seemed to be always looking for our waiter. For the type of money we spent (over $100USD a person) I expect the waiter to telepathically read my mind.

I eventually catch the female bartenders eye, and everyone that was there before me had been served so I assumed it was my turn next. She approaches me and as I open my mouth to order my drink, she takes the order of the man stood directly behind me, making me feel like I'm clearly invisible. She carried on as if I wasn't there. I then waited another 5 minutes, and a different bartender eventually took my order. I pay, and return to my friends to enjoy my drink after the effort of trying to obtain it. I'm then made aware by my friends that the bartenders automatically add a 12.5% service charge to any drink orders you make, which I really wouldn't mind, but 1) they should at least make it optional, not just immediately deduct it, and 2) I didn't feel like I actually received the service warranted to that 12.5% extra charge seeing as though I was initially ignored.

On the ground floor, we were warmly welcomed by the most dashing gentlemen who directed us to the glass elevator that goes right to the 38th floor, where we then entered Sushi Samba. The views were absolutely impressive from the bar, as well as from the outdoor terrace. We proceeded to the bar to order our cocktails, and were greeted by a very friendly and knowledgable bartender who pleasantly took our order and made us the most delicious cocktails. Here is where it all went downhill: As soon as he placed the cocktails on the bar, one of the female wait staff came by, dipped a straw in the cocktails, and went on to taste them right in front of us (I think she thought they were for customers in the restaurant)... she then made a face to the bartender as if she were being naughty and funny... he did not laugh, nor did we. This was highly inappropriate, as the bartender himself acknowledged. Following this, we experienced the rudeness of the other female waitstaff in the manner of pushing us out of their way as they tried to get drink orders from the bar, giving us dirty looks, and treating us as if we were not customers deserving of being in their very presence. For a high end restaurant, the service is lacking. I don't think I would ever eat here, as who knows what the female servers may do to the food and drink before bringing it to the table?! I have to say it was disappointing. My standards far exceed what was delivered.", "date_of_review": "7 June 2015"}

The views, as always were spectacular from this building . We settled down at a table (that was quite sticky) and I had to go to the bar for service... I seem to remember it was table service last time I came here , although I might be wrong.  Behind the bar looked chaos, despite it being quiet, with stuff stacked everywhere. The barman unenthusiastically made our cocktails as he shifted boxes of fruit and bunches of mint to get to the bottles of booze underneath. I know a little about cocktail shaking, and I know they should be shaken for about 12 seconds, any decent bartender will tell you the same... Ours were shaken for barely 5 seconds before they were poured into very plain glasses and garnished, unimaginatively, with a tired old bit of rolled up cucumber (a remnant from Saturday night perhaps) , an equally tired stinging nettle looking leaf (not sure what it was) and a bamboo straw, none of which added anything to the cocktails, they didn't even look that pretty.

The location is almost out of this world with fabulous views over the night sky of London. If you have a fear of heights, don't look down when you travel up to the top of the tower in a glass-sided lift! The decor inside the restaurant is stunning but with glass from floor to ceiling you can enjoy the views over the roof tops. We went to celebrate my daughter's birthday and despite being slightly late, due to the evening traffic, we were treated like royalty. The service was constant and attentive without it being intrusive, and the cocktails were divine with a great variety of different and unusual ones but with all the usual suspects for the Cosmo and Mohito lovers amongst us. The food was suitably out of this world too, to go with the views. There were six of us so we ordered just about everything on the menu from the sushi and sashimi side and then ordered it all again. My favourite was the salmon sashimi which just melted in the mouth. Although it was a very busy Friday evening, we were not rushed nor left waiting, and we did not feel that the restaurant was overcrowded, despite it being full. The ambience was spot on. Otto, the GM mentioned in a previous review, was attentive and charming and the perfect host as he orchestrated all his staff without fuss.

The first thing that captivates you is the incredible venue situated on the 38th floor of Heron Tower, which offers fantastic views of the city and contemporary Asian interior design. Even the glass lift is a great experience in which the view across the London rooftops opens up as it speeds upwards. When it comes to the food, it's all about the small sharing dishes which enable you and your table to enjoy a larger variety of the menu. We tried to cover as much as possible so ordered the prawn tempura and lobster taquitos from the small plates, lamb chop and asparagus off the robata grill then the tiger maki samba roll and the mini burgers (not on the menu). Hard to pick a standout dish as each was worthy of the excellent reputation this place has.  A few reviews seem to discredit the service but it was decent enough while we were there.

The different meal came in a hasty order, giving you a slight feeling that they really wanted you to eat, pay and leave. I fully understand that this is not the place to linger, but even though, the hastiness was a bit too obvious to my taste.

It is clear to see that the level of respect given to you directly corresponds to how much money you are prepared to spend in their establishment. I disagree fundamentally with anywhere that has such a disgraceful policy of reserving manners for the wealthiest of customers.  My friends and I dressed up for smart afternoon drinks, and headed up to the 39th floor (great ride in the lift). It was clear from the outset that as we were not dining in the restaurant we were not going to be treated with respect at all. The views are only good from one balcony on one side of the restaurant, which myself and a friend asked if we could quickly go out to when there was noone else out on the balcony. We were treated with absolute disgust; the waiter slammed down his pen, shrugged, and loudly complained to other staff about us. Is it really that surprising that after paying over \u00a38 for a small 125 ml of glass of wine (very standard wine, price included service charge which was most definitely not deserved), I wished to have a quick look at the view which we had travelled across London to see?! I also saw a waiter blocking the path of a fellow customer who also wished to be allowed to appreciate the outdoor balcony and nice view! To clarify, the door was open to the outside balcony and noone was out there. So all in all, a real shame that rudeness ruined our afternoon drinks. Management clearly has no respect for customers", "date_of_review": "26 May 2015"}

We were running a little late on the night so I called the restaurant to inform, the lady over the phone certainly didn't mince her words nor thank me for calling, clear that turning tables around over customer service was more important. So we got there as quickly as possible but as it was raining quite heavily we couldn't really see a thing! The ambiance in the restaurant was lovely however and we were seated and served promptly. Our lovely waiter recommended lots of items from the menu and being greedy, we ordered it all. The flavours were interesting to say the least, melted cheese in the samba rolls? Hmmm. It was an experience however and the pork belly was, wow...melt in your mouth! I found the black cod unimpressive and it arrived very late.

The Moqueca Mista sounded interesting, but fell short. Desserts were excellent: With Love From Rio (Coffee mousse, Chocolate ganache and Vanilla ice cream) and Chocolate Banan Cake with Rum ice cream were favorites.

Style over substance, just come for a cocktail and the view.", "comment": "I was very excited to visit Sushisamba after reading positive reviews and a recommendation from a couple of friends. I was also excited to be treating a special friend for her 40th birthday. We both love sushi and I thought that this would be the perfect setting. We arrived ok and ordered a cocktail at the bar. Fairly expensive cocktail prices but this wasn't an issue, it was more the 12.5% service charge that was compulsory...even though we were ordering at the bar. Never mind I thought, it's a treat for my friend. We then walked down to the restaurant and checked in with the girl on the front desk, we were then taken to our table by another member of staff. I'd asked for a window seat when I booked 3 months in advance. We did have a window seat, but the only view was the outdoor terrace. Ah well. A third member of staff came over to give us the menu, then a fourth member of staff came over to explain the menu and make some recommendations. Strangely, almost all the recommendations he made were the most expensive items on the menu, which we both found distasteful. We both found the waiter very insincere, as though he was reading a script. The wine list was extensive but eye-wateringly expensive. I hadn't planned on ordering the cheapest bottle as I was treating my friend, but the cheapest bottle was just under \u00a340, which I think is ridiculous. But, as I did have a budget, that's what I ordered. The wine was very average, and not cold enough when it was served. My local Sainsbury's do a bottle of Languedoc for \u00a38.50 which tastes far better than the wine we had. I ordered a range of dishes for us to share, and then we waited for the food. We didn't have to wait long, but the food was brought out by a fifth member of staff. We started with some deep fried squid with a dipping sauce. Some of the pieces were sliced too thinly so had dried out during the cooking process, and the dipping sauce just tasted like vinegar. My local Vietnamese restaurant does a deep fried squid dish that is better. Some of the other dishes were better - a ceviche, and sushi, and the star of the night was some delicious fresh sashimi which we couldn't fault. The service however, was not up to standard. In total we counted 9 different staff that we had encountered since arriving at the restaurant. It didn't feel like we were being 'looked after' by one particular member of staff, and it felt very much like a production line. One of the sushi dishes had a physalis garnish, which I wanted to eat after the sushi, but as soon as I had eaten the sushi, the plate was whisked away. The waitress also cleared our plates even though we had said we might want to look at the menu again if we hadn't quite ordered enough. Our glasses of wine were topped up constantly, even though we sometimes refused the top up - firstly, because both of us like to have a smaller amount of white wine in our glasses so it doesn't get warm, and also there was no way I could order a second bottle at that price. And when the waiter poured the last glasses for us from the bottle, he took it away with wine still in the bottom of the bottle - at least another half glass! After dinner we went to the bar for another cocktail, but I had to wait over 10 minutes to be served at the bar, and again a 12.5% service charge was added. So, overall - a special location with amazing views, so I would recommend friends to go for a cocktail, but perhaps not in the evening so they didn't have to wait so long. But the rest of the experience was very disappointing. I knew the meal would not be cheap - that was the whole point - I was treating my friend. I have eaten in many of London's top restaurants, so I know what excellent meals should taste like, and how much they cost, and what service should be like, at those prices. But I have had much better food in less swanky establishments - my local Vietnamese & turkish restaurants, a favourite little sushi place in Angel - at a fraction of the cost. If those prices are going to be charged, then the quality of the food, wine and service must match up. My friend still enjoyed her treat, but I felt absolutely gutted that I could have spent the money better elsewhere. Sadly I won't visit again.", "date_of_review": "13 May 2015"}

Mixture of the staff as some was excellent and had provided the best service where as some was not really paying attention (some waiters bumped into my and my friends chair couple of times) at all.", "date_of_review": "4 May 2015"}

However re-booked and Sushi Samaba pulled out all the stops to make up for it which was really appreciated. Restaurant is on the 38th Floor of the Heron Tower next to Liverpool Street station. On arrival courteous receptionist advised our table was being prepared and to have a drink at the bar for 5 minutes - girl behind bar was busy so didn't get a drink but before you knew it our table was ready and were shown to a fabulous banquette table with magnificent views over North London. Restaurant Manager acknowledged previous hiccup and presented us with a complimentary dish of seared tuna and Peruvian red potato which was really nice. Ordered an Asahi Beer each - although really should have gone for one of the many saki on offer, and bottled sparkling water. Started off with Miso soup - very nice with different types of mushroom followed by Shrimp tempura and Suzuki usuzukuri(white raw fish on bed of pickled veg and sauce) - excellent. Next had fillet teriyaki and kanpachi tiradto (raw white fish with truffle oil) -really well prepared and wonderful. Next we ordered Samba roll (8 pieces of mixed sushi, colourful and different) and Tiger Maki. Their sushi is really different with texture, crunch and excellent flavours and not \"gluey\". We meant to stop here - but couldn't resist another round so settled on Lobster taquitos (lobster in tacos type shell) and yellow tail taquitos. Mouth watering and well worth it. To top it all we were then presented with a desert of rum baba type cakes(without the rum) on a bed of sweet icing and thin biscuit shells and when they discovered it was my birthday as well presented us with a candle lit macaroon!  Well needless to say I had a absolutely fabulous time and experience - cuisine is extremely fresh, different and a whole new complexion on traditional Japanese food - a fusion of South American and Japanese - which is for the better. Service was impeccable, informative and friendly. Highly recommend SushiSamba . Our bill for 2 including service of 12.5% was \u00a3156 - well worth every penny!", "date_of_review": "5 May 2015"}

Once led through to the main restaurant you get a true feel of the class of this restaurant and the wonderful d\u00e9cor. The waiters are obviously well trained and knowledgeable about the dishes on the menu and are happy to explain what's on offer. As none of us had been here before our waiter suggested that we go for a mixture of dishes which we all agreed was probably best and basically we left it to him to choose the selection of dishes. We had far too many to go through in detail but everything we had was excellent. My favourites were probably a prawn dish and the lamb chops. But really all were just fantastic. There's a good selection of wines and cocktails, although my one criticism would be that the cocktails were a bit too strange for me. Cucumber cocktail! Just glad I wasn't paying the bill.

We had travelled up and hour and a half on my mother-in-laws birthday for some cocktails. We had been told on the phone to get there around 3 for a good chance of just having drinks, so we did. We were greeting by a rude man on the door who looked us up and down, demanded to know the ages of the party of 5 (all 21 to 60) and told us to come back two and a half hours later.  We stayed in the local area waiting until 6.30 when we believed we would be able to enter.  Upon re-arrival the same gentleman told us we couldn't go in. He said my partner, who was dressed in a shirt, black jeans, black leather shoes and a Barber coat, was dressed \"too casual\". My partner asked him why he couldn't have told us this 2.5 hours earlier instead of telling us to come back and us waiting nearby for all this time. The man, who said he was the manager, was extremely obnoxious and snooty, answered that he didn't notice what he was wearing earlier. He then said my partner was \"too scruffy\" for the venue which was absolutely ridiculous given what he was wearing was just as smart as others entering.  The said manager was raising his voice and upsetting my mother in law who just wanted a nice birthday. He then went on to say \"well fine you can't go in because SHE (pointing to me) is wearing sneakers\". I had on suit trousers, a black roll neck top, a smart overcoat, and all black smart \"sneakers\"/pumps.  What came next is, I'm afraid, just disgusting for any member of staff, let alone a manager. As we walked away, having been embarrassed and judged, the man followed my partner walking away from the door, raising his voice and looking to provoke an argument. He had to be stopped by the security man next to him.  I've never encountered such unprofessionalism and absolute rudeness by any staff, let alone manager. I am a journalist for a national lifestyle magazine and attend similar venues regularly but had never been to Sushisamba. I had been looking forward to the visit but was left shocked, appalled and upset at how the family birthday had been ruined.

Arrived at 8.10 and had to wait until 8.30 to be noticed. A strict looking blond woman looked at my 14 year-old son and announced \"minors are not allowed in the bar area and I will do my best to accomodate you. I will move people around so that you will have a table as soon as possible. But you must stay at this place and not move.\" I actually pre-informed them on the phone that I would be coming with my 14 year-old son. They seemed happy about it. Eventually we were seated (and we were made feel like a great favour was done for us). That is to take into account that on the phone they said \"make sure you arrive on time or you will lose your reservation\". The waitresses and waiters were roaming around, giving us empty smiles but once they realised we were not interested in their wine list they completely lost interest in us. When they finally took our order and delivered half of it, we had to chase up for the rest. In the end we had about 3/4 of what we ordered but were tired of the experience and asked for the bill. 12.5% of service charge was added (although there was no indication of this on the menue or anywhere on the website). It's ok. We did not quibble. But it was amusing that (as I paid in cash) the waiter disappered with extra \u00a315 on the top of the total an it took him 10 minutes to come back (even though I could actually see him at the till standing and waiting for us to go). Out of principle I was not prepared to let that money go (they just did not deserve it in my opinion). In the end he brought me the change and literally threw it on the table in front of me. Yuck. What an unstylish way to treat customers. I thought it was rude throughout. And to expect a mother with a teenager to order wine in front of her child - that is disgusting. There was a positive moment of course. Trip up and down the lift was an exciting experience and also the view from the windows was stunning. If you have not got a \"minor\" you will also be allowed to the terrace - where I think you could see a lot more. Well, that was our day out. Hope that it will be helpful. Also, I must say that the place is intended for you to spend as much money as possible. They expect you to leave a lot of your earnings there (including tips on top of service charge). Some dishes are several hunderd pounds (one is \u00a31000). If you are on a middle income staff looks humiliatingly down at you.

As you reach the 39th floor your anticipation and excitement grows exponentially. As the doors of the lift open you walk through a dark mood evoking corridor and out into a bury of life.

Here they swiftly and pleasantly navigated us to the main dining arena. What a space lighter than light with a view of practically the whole of London stunning! The decor was right up my street you could sense the design was centred around the three cultures fused into one.  Our very friendly waiter was the highlight of my meal he he guided us through the menu and suggested ideas to make a nice selection of bites as it was our first time eating there.

Stand out dishes were the black cod and the tiger maki rolls. We also order a cocktail each as we thought they would be fitting with our meal, once again our waiter was helpful in advising us on taste and pallet. I must say I am 100% a real ale man but these none pretentious cocktails were brilliant so light and refreshing. As we recieved our bill we more than happy to pay and the matradie asked if everything was ok and I replied \"excellent especially the service\"!

This was our third visit and each time we go in the hope that Sushisamba will finally live up to its potential - and each time we are disappointed. We will not be going back. If like us you weren't organised enough to be at your PC exactly 2 months before your dining date, you probably got an odd time slot (we were at 9.15pm). So far no problem - the anticipation (and a snack) will probably make that work.  Sadly, the anticipation was the best part.  On the day, we arrived slightly early and were told to wait. Kept waiting while the girls at reception chatted with customers that did not have reservations and were trying to sweet talk them into giving them a table. I don't know if giving away unreserved tables is a side business but the girls were happy to ignore the line of customers with reservations to go on chatting.  Having been seated late, we gave our drinks order immediately and asked to give the food order in 5 mins. Drinks arrived 20 mins later - odd because we only ordered beer and wine - and they got that wrong too. Kept waiting for the right drinks - no sign of them for about 30 further minutes.  Taking a pause from the horror, one must admit the food has maintained its high standards - the tiger maki is great as are some of the other rolls. Black cod was decent (although nothing comes close to Nobu) and shrimp tempura was also good. However, the overall experience leaves you dissatisfied at best, angry at worst. Everything from the exclusive night-club like velvet rope at the entry to the glass lift up 38 floors and the great decor/view/music and even food set the stage for an evening that ultimately disappoints - and that really takes some doing!", "date_of_review": "22 April 2015"}

However the 39th Floor 'annex' is a different experience. The Sunday evening jazz band were extremely good but the volume in the room next to the bar was so high it was difficult to have a conversation. The service was appalling and the minute menu made it difficult to choose anything that was appealing. The waiter told us he wasn't able to deliver food from the main restaurant - I've no idea why they couldn't bring it up 1 flight of stairs and whether the bar has a separate kitchen, doubtful. The drinks took forever to arrive, the food too. We had at least 4 if not 5 different people serving us and the service was an utter shambles. The portions were microscopic but the prices were anything but! The idea of a jazz band in the bar is a great idea on a Sunday evening but treating the food-eating customers as an inconvenience and afterthought is totally unacceptable. I will stick to Roka from now on.", "date_of_review": "22 April 2015"}

Really, I love it. I just have one problem: I feel like you go out of your way to make your customer feel the opposite of being valued for their custom! I have dined in your restaurant in the past. I absolutely loved the experience - perhaps because I was in a party of 10, and we spent around \u00a3200 per head. The food was great. Service not to write home about, but adequate.  This evening however, I felt extremely disappointed. Again, your cocktail was great. The view was great. The orange tree was great. I even discovered the monkey in your tree, that was great too. The evening took a little turn when I fancied nothing on your menu but a little glass of Japanese plum wine - I see it at the bar, and had it in my first cocktail, but apparently you can't serve it to me because there is no button to push on your till. Fair enough, I had another cocktails with something sprayed on top to satisfy my food-colouring craving of the day.  I said to my partner, let's try get some food. He enquired with a member of staff, waiting time 1.5 hours, but apparently we can wait for seating at the bar. Fair enough I thought, we didn't book. 30 mins later, a couple got up and left. Having waited behind them for long enough I jumped in the chair. Great, I thought, let's order! A waiter came over: you should have asked to be seated over there, there might be a queue, let me check. 'Oh ok, I'm sorry we didn't know.' I replied. 'We did ask and the lady told us to wait for seats at the bar. Please can we have a menu?' 20 mins later, we watched as the same waiter disappeared into the restaurant area with a tray of drinks. Having given up on ever getting a menu from him, we asked another waitress she brought it to us within 30 seconds. The waiter returned, apparently a little annoyed that we couldn't wait for him. 'How many rolls are in the samba rolls dish?' I asked. 'Wait, he said. Let me explain you the menu.' Another 20 mins passed before he eventually returned and took our order. During this time I watched him flirt with the girls at the other end of the bar. Another 25 mins passed before our food eventually arrived. I was too tired at this point to enjoy my food (this was past 11pm on a school night). I have been around on the London social scene for a decade. I understand the need for a lovely place like sushisamba to sometimes be a little snobby - some people feel the harder they have to work to get a table the more they want to come here. Then they can boast to their mates. After all, you can't make it as easy as it is to get a table at dirty dicks down the road. But really, this was the most terrible service I have received. I want to come back and rate your place to my friends, please give me a reason to. Kind regards, A disappointed customer", "date_of_review": "16 April 2015"}

As we went through to our table, someone was soon there with a tray to carry our drinks for us. The service was attentive, but not overbearing. As this was a first visit, they explained the menu clearly and advised that 5-7 dishes between the two of us would be ideal. The waitress also highlighted the Sambatini from the cocktail menu...a gin infused drink with mandarin....a truly lovely drink!  The food arrived at intervals....I personally would recommend the salt and pepper squid...but all dishes were amazing. Instead of a pudding my partner tried another dish, I, however, ordered a pudding....it was the best pudding that I have ever tasted. Chocolate, chilli, raspberry and red pepper concoction...unbelievably good. However, don't expect a low budget meal by any stretch, but expect great food, efficient and informative service and amazing food. The stunning view also helped.

Especially towards the end of our meal, after dessert none of the waiters took our plates or asked if we would like the bill until at least half an hour later. Also, I am Brazilian and didn't find any Brazilian dishes on the menu, despite the restaurant being advertised as Peruvian-Japanese-Brazilian fusion (we were in the lounge which I was told has a limited menu than the main restaurant, but still). Overall a great experience, worth it.", "date_of_review": "7 April 2015"}

The manager kept trying to persuade me that I was having an allergic reaction.I kept running in and out of the toilet throwing up and after the 4th time it then it started coming out of the other end.  I was there for about 2 hours in their toilets trying not to pass out. Their bouncer was told to go in there to keep eye on the situation. He was picking arguments with me and my friends, you would expect that they would be trying to help the situation instead of behaving like this! We were waiting for the ambulance to arrive and he kept saying to women coming into use the toilets - I think she is on drugs, as she isn't saying anything! I'm a person who doesn't drink alcohol and do drugs. How dare he try and make such litigious remarks! Where was the manager at this point, why wasn't he dealing with the situation, instead of this neanderthal of a guy! They were trying very hard not to let anyone know I had food poisoning. It's very severe if a person gets this sort of reaction after an hour of eating! I closed and locked the door as I needed to use the toilet again and the security guy unlocked the door and pushed the door open, while I was on the toilet!!! Are you kidding me, I am throwing my guts up and suffering from cramps and I have to deal with a pervert too! They were trying very hard to get the ambulance crew to say it was an allergic reaction, as there were lots of people in the restaurant observing, however the ambulance crew said they would have to examine me before they could say anything. They took me out on a wheelchair to the ambulance outside and concluded it was food poisoning.  The restaurant has my details and have they contacted me - no. I contacted them the next day have they replied no. Not a place I would ever visit again or recommend to anyone else. I have also reported them to the Health and Safety organisation, as they have no duty of care towards their clients and I do not wish anyone to experience what I did that night.

On-line booking successful and reasonably simple; they checked we were still coming by phone but when we arrived an hour early (allowing for traffic and parking that was much easier than expected due to Sunday timing) we noticed there were plenty of spare tables so we went in early. I thought the place is a little tired and worn, seen in the harsh light of day- at night i am sure it will still seem magical but I noticed the worn paintwork in the gents toilets - did not have a sense of fine dining quality. Table top chipped and worn too. Still we had pleasant service, even if our waiter was a little hard to understand. The food arrives in the order cooked, not necessarily as you may expect, but it goes to the middle of the table so we could all share. Food was good, I loved their salad dish for example which was full of colour, textures, flavours and fun.  Cocktails with the food were relatively expensive; typically \u00a313- at night given the view i can understand that, but midday these seem steep. Wine by the glass was reasonable price and quality.  All of the cooking was good, but there were no \"wow\" dishes other than the salad. We had a main dish of Moqueca Mista: jumbo shrimp, squid, sea bass, mussels, clams, coconut milk, dend\u00ea oil, chimichurri rice - which was tasty but one jumbo shrimp 6 clams and mussels and a little squid did not feel great value relative to the standard dishes we had along side. Puddings were an Easter special and with love from Brazil which was chocolate and coffee with a few nuts plus a delicious biscuit- all very sweet but none of the other diners wanted to share it. Service was OK; I splashed some of the juice from the main course on my shirt- the waiter quickly offered to get some soda water, then did not get it, and pretended to ignore the table and the offer (despite the place not being that busy) so i had to go to the gents and sort it out myself- very odd- my family reminded him while i was away and he said he had to discuss it with the manager but never followed it up- perhaps they were out of soda water or have a policy of not assisting guests with spilled food?   More worrying was the bill; we had an extra, expensive dish added that we did not have, and i could not even see on the menu. I pointed it out, they went into a huddle and came back with \"computer error\", no \"sorry\"- took bill away, re-printed, nothing said. Hmm- if i return, i would keep a careful track of what I ordered next time in case it is not so easy to see. I think this is a serious error which at least they have to apologize for.- as it was, it felt odd, almost as if they thought they were right and we had forgotten we had this mystery dish (of a description and price which was not on current menu).  Despite indifferent service they add 12.5% \"discretionary\" service. In this case it was not good enough, given that this is a fairly expensive place. If it were not for the view, I would not consider returning- as there is a great view, i might go back in an evening sometime, but given how booked up this place is, if my experience is typical i think they are living on novelty and location more than on quality of food and service.", "date_of_review": "5 April 2015"}

There were not even very many customers at the bar - it certainly wasn't full - but every single one of them was upset 'cause they'd been standing there waiting for a good 20-30 minutes! The two that did serve were pretentious and slow, it seemed like they were purposely taking their time pouring the drinks in as slow a style as they could, seemingly not at all bothered about customer service. I really cannot comprehend why, as a bar owner, your strategy wouldn't be to give your visitors a good experience?! Why have ten barstaff and only two pretentious gits serving drinks?!

The downstairs bar area wasn't very busy or full of atmosphere and the upstairs bar wasn't even open. We went through to our table and were greeted by almost all the staff members we passed which was nice. The restaurant itself is very funky and has a great view. I suspect this would be better if you are blessed enough to get a table near the front facing window. We ordered two cocktails after being seated for 15 minutes which were delicious - highly recommend the 'Nina Fresh'. We then ordered 7 plates from various sections on the menu and liked the Tuna handroll (sorry I cannot remember the full name), lamb rabata and the pork belly. None were exceptionally spectacular though. It was clear about halfway through the meal we weren't paying for the food but rather the view and service. If you do eat here I would suggest for two people around 5-6 plates is enough. We were stuffed by the time the 4th plate came out and the waiter were good enough to cancel one of our final orders which was late in arriving because we simply couldn't eat any more. The wait staff were friendly and attentive without being overpowering or pushy. The drinks are slow to come out but this is understandable when almost everyone orders a complex cocktail. After dinner we took our drinks and went through to the bar for a few more. As I was paying for a round that cost \u00a322 (two drinks) I checked the card machine before entering my pin and noticed the staff member had charged me \u00a329.50. I DO NOT think for a second this was a mistake. I DO think he was trying to underpay the til which is so common in London at the moment so it pays to be diligent when paying by card. All in all we had a lovely evening but that was more on the company rather than this establishment. After paying over \u00a3250 for the evening we can both agree there MUCH better places to eat for a fraction of the price.

On arrival of the 38th, and after you've recovered from your ears popping you're walking along into the bar area, where you can enjoy a cocktail with more incredible views, or watch some skilled craftsmen making art for your mouths in the sushi kitchen (which you can eat at). Once shown to our table, we were greeted by the area manager, (Jacob??) who introduced himself and asked what we liked to drink, we said what we were in the mood for and he suggested some cocktails that we went with, and boy were we glad that we did! The current Sambatini is like a citrussy Gin concoction that tastes as though an angel is crying her lemony flavoured tears into your mouth, it's that good. The other one that really caught the eye, or the mouth, was the one that tasted like a boozy Solero ice cream, I couldn't tell you what was in it, but trust me it's good. We ordered a couple of small plates to get us started, sharing some Salt and Pepper Squid, and some Pork Belly. We were upsold into having their Kobe Beef Burger sliders, and weren't disappointed by them. Whilst small in size, they were huge in flavour. Beef burgers that melt in the mouth, and complimented by some horseradish mayo.  I feel I should probably write a whole paragraph on the Squid, as I happen to be in a relationship with a self-confessed squid addict, but it's really something special. Light, crispy, full of taste, and beautifully presented, enough about myself, but the Squid was also the same. The pork belly I'd eaten on a previous trip, and it was every bit as good as I remembered. I'd recommend both as must-eats. We then ordered off the waiter's advice some fillet beef and lamb as mains, which were cooked to perfection, and again presented beautifully. We asked if we needed anything else and were advised that we'd ordered plenty, and it was refreshing not to be told to keep ordering. We finished with a Samba London sushi platter which was the best sushi I've ever eaten, admittedly not much of an expert but it's 100x better than Wasabi, Tesco etc, obviously. We were too full for dessert, but there are some quite sexy looking desserts if you fancy a sweet ending to your meal.  We had some more cocktails throughout the meal, which were all lovely, and the beer is a nice Japanese one (Asahi from memory).  The service throughout was impeccable. The food incredible. The views very good. At the end of the meal, a few pounds lighter in the wallet, and a few heavier at the waist, we left via the Lift that wouldn't be out of place in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (you know the scene) and descended at lightning speed back down to normality.", "date_of_review": "7 April 2015"}

The seafood large plate with chimichurri rice was good too. The tomyam cocktail was good too. Middling foods for me were the kobe cocktail, the mushroom large plate, and the kobe tiradito. I'm pretty sure the famous kobe cocktail can and should taste better, but even with my experience with whiskeys I couldn't pinpoint the kobe wash nor the salted caramel.

We put our coats in the cloakroom and went to let the restaurant know that we had arrived - even though we were a bit early for the table. We decided to have a drink at the bar and go out on the terrace for a drink as it was a lovely evening. Amazing views. The meal itself was wonderful - we had a mixture of sushi, Peruvian and Brazilian food a lot of which was recommended by our waiter who was knowledgeable about all the dishes. We finished off with a couple of deserts which were to die for.  Okay this place is expensive and not an everyday meal, but for a special occasion worth a visit.", "date_of_review": "1 April 2015"}

We would often dine in the restaurant. It was a very popular venue. I had a particularly important client in town last week and decided to take her for a drink and lunch in the restaurant but had not booked. I was asked at the entrance by a very rude man if we had a reservation to which I replied we didn't but would happily settle for drinks at the bar. He proceeded to look my guest and I up and down and then declared we were not dressed smart enough for the venue. We were wearing jeans, shoes and winter coats as it was a cold day. I have always been dressed in a similar manner every time I have visited in the past. The two ladies in front of us were wearing sports shoes and were granted access. I have never been so humiliated in front of a client. She also took great offence at this man's comments. She was wearing a wrist watch which I imagine is equal in value to this man's annual wages! She is a very successful and well known doctor in the US and I don't think she is used to being spoken to and judged in such a way by a glorified and jumped up doorman. His name was Cleo (apparently). When I asked for his name, he said he could only give it to me if I gave him my name also. He seemed to think he was very clever. We decided to head across to the Shard instead where we had a fantastic meal at Aqua. The view is also infinitely better. They were very welcoming and clearly know how to treat their customers with some dignity and respect. From now on I know where I'll be taking future international clients and guests who wish to see the London sights. I will not be taking any future business to Sushisamba and will be recommending all of my acquaintances both professional and personal steer clear of the venue. I sincerely hope the management look further into the lack of professionalism and disgusting, judgemental attitude of their staff.", "date_of_review": "27 March 2015"}

The restaurant had lots of covers and I had anticipated the restaurant would be quieter as is with most places in the City on a weekend. Wrong! By the time we had left, and a few tables had been reset, the place was packed. This did not detract from the service one bit. Our waiters introduced themselves. Memorably Jacob was the waiter that impressed us the most. His excellent knowledge of the menu and helpful suggestions added to our dining experience. Although, neither of us fancied the \u00a328 cocktail or the \u00a31000 Kobe option. I was so glad my partner opted for neither of those as I was paying! I have to say, we have eaten sushi all over the world and this was some of the most innovative, visually-appealing and to die-for flavours that we had ever experienced. The desserts were also great and Jacob had organised for my partner's dessert to be presented with Happy Birthday written in chocolate and a candle too. Discreet and charming.

If the high speed glass walled lift does not persuade you then the views from the terrace surely will.  I do not feel qualified to talk about the Sushi Samba restaurants in other countries so as is my norm\u2026.I\u2019ll direct these comments towards the restaurant I experienced. \u2013 Sushi samba \u2013 very near to Bishopsgate, London First and foremost if you visit, persevere because during the rare quiet moments the entrance is not blatantly obvious or grand. However from 6pm onwards things get very, very busy indeed and you will find a doorman welcoming you and shepherding the queues which can become very lengthy on Thursday and Friday and Saturday.  In my experience EVERY member of staff I ever met here across three visits gave a friendly, warming welcome and was willing to help me wherever and however possible in fully enjoying my visit. This extends from the doorman on the street to the reception staff and right through to the (extremely talented) cocktail barmen, chefs, waiters, waitresses, managers and senior managers.  One of the latter is now a casual friend / strong acquaintance and has assisted me with the table bookings situation from time to time so it\u2019s well worth reciprocating the attitude and mind set built into the ambience of this marvellous place.  So \u2026\u2026having travelled half the planet working for airlines and often travelling first class on business \u2026what makes this place so outrageously special.  It is not the price.  (Do not be put off \u2013 this place is designed to be a special treat \u2013 a true life event \u2013 something to almost save up for then savour the moments when you get there. But, if \u00a375 per head is going to break the bank please do not read any further.)  If, like me, you truly believe you get what \u201cyou get what you pay for in life\u201d then this restaurant is the epitome however, you don\u2019t just get \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026you REALLY GET\u2026\u2026\u2026here\u2019s what you get and I doubt this list is exhaustive.  Here\u2019s what I got (on three separate repeated occasions) \u2022 The street level welcome was warm, friendly , amicable and helpful \u2022 The queue for the lift was acceptable, a 10 minute delay, in a crowd of really quite excited and expectant people of seemingly of a similar mind set \u2022 The lift is as scary as hell first time and only slightly more fun after that \u2022 The view from the lift gets better and better \u2013 target the sunset period for your arrival \u2013 amazing. \u2022 The reception area staff welcomed us, took our coats , guided us towards the bars and the terraces and cross checked our bookings and details \u2013 VERY professional, warm, and friendly \u2022 The Bar \u2013 COCKTAILS \u2013 O.M.G \u2013 treat your senses to some novel delights Totally amazing  \u2022 Nothing in the restaurant is low priced - EVERYTHING is worth every penny and good value \u2022 The clientele \u2013 I hope it is accidental but nature runs its cause at this place \u2013 so people who understand the finer things in life take the time trouble and money to enjoy this experience I hope this doesn\u2019t come across wrong but some clever self marketing must be going on somewhere  \u2022 The restaurant itself is fairly standard \u2013 i.e I really do not recall the chairs or table type. But each time I visited we were comfortable whilst eating. \u2022 What is truly memorable is sitting outside on the piazza eating our dinner whilst the sun set and the moon rose \u2013 marvellous. \u2022 The food menu is Sushi combined with quality South American beef based plates of food. I recommend focusing around the Sushi but the waiter gave excellent guidance towards some of the most popular dishes \u2013 every mouthful enjoyed.  \u2022 The presentation of the food was such that we felt compelled ot take phots and the taste surpassed the expectation set by the eyes.  \u2022 Accompanying drinks remained expensive but appropriately so. The view alone makes the price good value but you do not get service, presentation, flavour, balance and ambience with a view for a low cost \u2022 So the final thing we got was the bill and a feeling of sadness when we had to leave !! We recommend you book some time in advance because it gets really busy and the queues get long \u2026.very long. Our tip would be to go at a quieter time. The subtle ambience is more than a little spoiled when the bars get very busy  So if you would like to experience something more than a little bit special then try this place\u2026..

On arrival at the base of Heron Tower, a bouncer let us into the building and we took a glass lift to the 38th floor. The lift up to the 38th is good fun and you get a taste of the great views to enjoy from the restaurant/bar. Once we got to the 38th we walked to the entrance of the restaurant (nobody greeted us which I thought was poor) and after flagging down some help, we were told to walk across the restaurant to a \"check in\" desk (this should really have been at the entrance). We confirmed our booking/name \u2013 no smile, no welcome, just \"ok, take a seat guys by the bar and we'll call you when ready\". I'm not sure if it was just the day/time (Tuesday, 9pm) but the place was full of suits. To go with this a fair few couples and a number of girls that looked like they'd just come off the set of TOWIE (doing their best to get the attention of the suits).  We grabbed 2 rounds of cocktails (\u00a313 x 2) + beers (\u00a37 x 2) at the bar \u2013 a little surprised that service charge is added to the bill as they don't do much + the service was rather unfriendly. There were a number of inebriated city types screaming/elbowing each other by the bar/trying to cut in front of us so I ended up having to hand one of them off \u2013 a bit like going to a secondary school disco in a village hall. We lucked out and managed to get a seat right by the window looking out over the Gherkin. The view is by far the best thing about Sushi Samba in my opinion \u2013 absolutely amazing.  At 9:30 we got up, walked over to the check in desk type thing only to be told our table wasn't ready. We lost our great seats and ended up standing around like muppets with a number of other couples that also couldn't be seated. Cut a long, boring story short we didn't get seated until 10:05. In fairness, the lady was very apologetic.  We sat down, looked at the menu then asked 2 members of staff to take our order \u2013 neither of them could as that was apparently beyond their remit. We decided that if no one came to take the order within 5 minutes, we'd just leave. Luckily, an extremely helpful gentleman appeared and talked us through the menu/made some suggestions. We ordered: SHRIMP TEMPURA snap pea julienne, spicy mayo, black truffle vinaigrette 14.00 CRISPY TAQUITOS two per order YELLOWTAIL avocado and roasted corn miso 12.00 KUROMITSU GLAZED PORK BELLY WRAPS palmito, orange, bibb lettuce 12.00 BLACK COD miso 18.50 EL TOPO\u00ae salmon, jalape\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion 12.00 The tempura was poor, the yellowtail taquitos were very nice, the pork belly wraps were fine, the black cod was nice but nothing special. The el topo was fine but again nothing special. By this point (around 11:10) we just wanted to go home.  In summary, I really don't think the food is anything special \u2013 style (limited in parts) over substance. I must say I'm not a fan of fusion food in general but even still, the food just wasn't that good in my opinion. It'd be better to just go to a good Japanese restaurant or a good steakhouse/churrascaria.  However, the view is amazing. Fellas take your special ones here \u2013 they'll love it.  The service was hot and cold. In general the floor staff and bar staff were poor. When you go to any restaurant (especially a fancier one) you should get a warm welcome, people should be smiling and attentive not stressed out and rude. The gentleman that took our order (appeared to be almost like the front of house) was excellent \u2013 friendly, charming, knowledgeable \u2013 if only all the staff were \u00bd as good, the experience would have been 2 times better.

Put simply, this place is fabulous if you want a view of London, cheaper and nicer food than other well known 'up high' London venues, and great service with a few cocktails thrown in. I will definitely return\u2026", "date_of_review": "22 March 2015"}

I first visited with friends for dinner. I really didn't think much of the food back then as it was so overpriced, the stuffy service didn't help. The atmosphere in the bar however was really good. So since then I have been a regular to the bar only!  I had noticed on my last few visits that things were going down hill. When you are paying \u00a37 for a small bottle of beer or \u00a317 for a cocktail you kind of expect a nice drink and a certain level of service.  Instead I've noticed the quality of both have severely gone downhill and the service is downright rude.  On one of my recent visits I waited at the bar for 30 mins only for the barman to tell me I wasn't going I be served because I was standing at the wrong section of the bar. He had just served someone standing next to me!  When I explained that I had been waiting 30 mins and asked if I moved if he would serve me, I was ignored.  I was so annoyed I just got my stuff and left with the rest of my party. I was still fuming a few days later so I sent a complaint via email.  Within a few days I received a response from the managements of the bar apologising and asking if I would like to come back for complimentary drinks and snacks to prove my experience was a one off. I took up this offer and actually thought we we would be taken care of. I was told to go to the front desk and tell them I have an area reserved in my name and me and my party would be taken care of. Well we got there and no one had a clue about such reservation. I was told to speak to Gareth (the duty manager on the night) if any issues. Gareth couldn't be located for 20 minutes.  When we finally tracked him down he did know of the reservation but didn't bother to actually reserve any seats, so we had to be wait whilst he run around trying to find somewhere. There wasn't any food as promised but we was given \u00a3125 on tab. This sounds great and you are probably thinking why am I still not satisfied. Each drink took over 30 mins to arrive again!!  This was so annoying and actually spoiled our night.  We ended up using the money on tab and leaving straight away.  We went to the alchemist for decent cocktails at half the price all served with a smile. I'm not generally one to complain but this place clearly thinks it's something great.", "date_of_review": "23 March 2015"}

Interesting combinations of flavours, with so many choices from the menu.  The whole restaurant was buzzing and just had a lovely feel to it. The views are amazing.

That's the first word that pops into my mind when I think about our meal at Sushi Samba. So much so, that even when the food came (which was actually good), we couldn't really enjoy it. The chefs are being seriously let down by the front of house staff. Being herded from station to station. Waiting at the front desk for someone to come and take my name. But they couldn't take me to my table. I had to wait for another earpiece wielding suit to come along. Who then forgot what table he was taking me to.  Fortunately, my friend had arrived before me, so I could take us to my table. The staff seem to want to put up every barrier possible to actually get into the restaurant. It took my fiance 20 minutes from arriving at the front desk downstairs, to actually sitting with us at the table. One of my friends was arriving later to meet us for a drink at the bar. She'd arrived a bit early, whilst we were just finishing up, but wasn't allowed to come into the dining room to see us.  When asking for recommendations, three of the five staff who served us seemed totally uninterested in talking to us. One suggested edamame beans, and then when we didn't answer straight away (we were clearly reading the description, as he hadn't given us any more information or choices), he actually said \"Hello?!\" is that patronising, stroppy way that you expect from grumpy teenagers or arrogant, highly strung executives. The bar was nice, but very little outside seating. The terrace is beautiful, but we didn't hang about because it was absolutely freezing, and only one heat lamp seemed to be working.

However, we had a number of staff serving our table at various points in time but we were aware that we had a allocated Waitron. She made it rather clear that she did not particularly enjoy our table, which I presume was due to the questions we asked as it was our first time. The rest of the waiters continued to pass my chair and continually bumped into it and not once did they apologise. I did my best to push my chair in as much as possible, but they were intent on serving food and little regard was given to the rude behaviour that they were engaging in. Of course it is a busy restaurant but it was blatantly rude. And of course we were promptly ushered out at 9pm after the 12,5% service charge was included.

Your experience starts with an glass lift shooting you up 38 floors in a matter of seconds offering you an amazing view from the minute you start your ride until you reach the entrance to the restaurant. When you arrive you will walk down a narrow corridor and arrive at a less than impressive (small) bar with three staff on it seeming like they're struggling with the demands of the three or four deep throng of newly arrived customers but don't rush, take a look out on the amazing roof terrace space and grab a quick glance of another aspect of London's skyline that you wouldn't have got from the lift ride (that also has a bar on it, though this would only be open in the summer months and not in February when I was there). Once you've settled in, I suggest you take a walk up the orange spiral staircase to the 39th floor where a longer bar awaits you; less rushed and better equipped with less flustered bar staff manning it. Cocktails here are amazing but not cheap - \u00a312 - \u00a318 each is the norm but the craft used to make them is well worth watching :-) Take in the views and chat the small stuff, the Brazilian samba music soundtrack gives this venue a very cool yet relaxed vibe and you could easily order 2, 3 or even 4 rounds of cocktails without looking at your watch once.  Should you however have booked a table for the restaurant, ensure you arrive at the check-in desk on time otherwise you are likely to lose your reservation; we were told they were running slightly late and to wait in the bar so we went outside on the terrace and then when they couldn't find us, we nearly lost our table (so wouldn't be pleased after booking it 8 weeks earlier!) but once in the restaurant and having ordered, the food came swiftly and was presented immaculately. The waiters were all very friendly and helpful, describing each dish in detail and not rushing us to finish any course at any point. The food is a Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian fusion so needs a little explaining but the items we ordered were simply amazing!  A meal here is an event, a special treat and definitely memorable for all the right reasons, do be prepared however to spend more than you would in lots of other places, 3 rounds of cocktails and 6 sushi dishes between 2 of us came to \u00a3230.00 so not a cheap night but WOW, no regrets on any of it - it made our weekend!!", "date_of_review": "2 March 2015"}

We had a selection of the cocktails, and food from various parts of the menu, as well as desserts. It really was all excellent and a bit different to the sort of places I would usually eat. We found the sushi and the fusion elements inventive and excellent in taste and presentation. The staff were friendly, knowledgable, and helpful (without lingering too much), the decor and ambiance were very striking, and the views on a clear day are great. I find upscale restaurants can be stuffy and too full of \"suits\" or too busy trying to be clever and delivering meagre portions, but that is not the case here - just great food, with a good mixed crowd, even on a weekday lunchtime. It works best if you are in a small group then you can really order lots of different things to try, but my most recent visit was as a couple and we still had some good variety (with advice from the server on quantities). Overall one of my favourite restaurants. The only downside is the wait for a reservation (it is popular), and it is pricey (so a special treat rather than a regular haunt).", "date_of_review": "3 March 2015"}

Overall I really liked it, few observations that are worth mentioning. Our main waiter (we seem to have about 4, this might explain things later) was great, very friendly and explained the menu very well. He advised that most dishes were quite small and a certain number should be ordered for the table. The waiter suggested I think it was a \"churacas\" meat platter, this was ordered along with a hot stone wagyu beef dish, sadly these never arrived and on chasing these after all the other food had been finished, it transpired the request for those never made it to the kitchen and the waiter had now disappeared. This happened once more with a drinks order too unfortunately,perhaps it was down to multiple waiters serving but it was a bit frustrating..

The view is amazing and the lift to the 38th floor is cool and quite an experience. But, and it's a big but, the food and service are simply terrible.  This is not a cheap place to eat and personally, I've had better seafood & sushi at Itsu for lunch costing me \u00a37. The service was equally as bad, we were being brought next courses before the last course empty plates had been taken away and astonishingly, rather than take the old plates away, they actually just pushed them to one side to put the new food down!!! So we sat with a table cramped full of empty and dirty plates as new food was squashed in alonsgide. At a restaurant where the cheapest red wine is \u00a354 for an average (i.e \u00a38 from Waitorse) Rioja, you expect a little more when your total bill is well into the \u00a3hundreds.  I love food, and I appreciate you get good and bad. I've eaten street food to 3 Michelin stars and had good and bad experiences and this was by far, the biggest let down I've ever had when you compare hype, reputation, cost and the actual experience - complacency at its worst and I wish we'd never gone - waste if money, however they do have a nice view!!", "date_of_review": "1 March 2015"}

I left with the feeling that I had just been \"had\" - for a number of reasons:  1) The cocktail (which was on the upper end of the London price average) was mostly tasteless, as were all of them in fact - we were a group of 6 and all underwhelmed  2) The sushi was mediocre. Nice fresh sashimi (probably some of the best I have had)but the rest of it was no different from the quality you can get in Itsu for a fraction of the price. Vastly, vastly overpriced for what it was - \u00a314 for 4 Maki rolls, no thank you very much! I understand paying a premium for good food, but the quality MUST match up which for me, it did not...  3) The service - a friend of mine who was with us in the group was raving about the last time he had been to Sushisamba and said the waiter he and his girlfriend had was literally doing cartwheels out of the kitchen as he was so excited to serve them and be enthusiastic about the food. Instead for us, a very dour waiter came over with an attitude like we were being a nuisance for even thinking we would like to be served. Distinct lack of knowledge about the menu or what to recommend and forgot about us numerous times, we had to crane our necks to get his attention. When the bill finally came (after a lot of effort to get said waiter's attention), we split the bill and all sat with our cards at the ready on the table. Various waiters sashayed by and ignored us, until the floor manager spotted that we had our cards out and came over and we were finally able to pay.  For the amount of money you shell out and the great location of this restaurant, one would expect both higher quality food and service. I have had considerably better food and service for the same price in other establishments in London, and am in no hurry to go back to Sushisamba", "date_of_review": "20 February 2015"}

The cocktails were also delicious, although enjoyed after a 20 minute wait at the bar.  Unfortunately my experience was dampened by the poor service of the hostess who upon our arrival (on time) told us our table wasn't ready and she would find us at the bar when it was. 20 minutes later we were still waiting and when I asked her again she said 2 minutes. Another 15 and we are still waiting. When I asked a second time I was barely acknowledged and she proceeded to help four other waiting groups, with me clearly standing there. A waitress then appeared to take me and my party to our table, however none of this was explained.

Then when taken through to the dining area it is beautifully decorated with the main focus being the views the restaurant offers. We were welcomed by our waiter (Felix) and sat at our table. We spent some time looking at what was on offer, struggling to narrow the menu down. Our waiter spent some time getting to know us, what we like to eat and having discussed these he was able to suggest the best combination of items from the menu and really feel that having taken his suggestion we had some of the most delicious food I have ever had.

One, I do not like heights. Two, I've never really got sushi! I was a little freaked at walking into the bar, and looking down on The Gherkin building. This restaurant is very high!  So a business colleague phoned ahead and let them know I was not crazy about the height, and could they please sit us in the middle of the room. We were given a lovely booth right in the middle of room and within 10 minutes I was feeling absolutely fine.  The waiter was very knowledgeable about the food, he explained that Sushi Samba is Sushi meets Brazilian and Peruvian, and we asked him for some recommendations. We ordered everything he recommended. This is a great sharing restaurant, and you can order lots of little plates to share. We ordered about 10 plates between five of us. Really enjoyed the Black Cod, Sea Bass Tempura, Toro Sashimi, and Kobe Beef burgers. Chocolate Banana Cake dessert is heavenly. Fully recommend this restaurant!

The tiger rolls were absolutely amazing and the vegan and vegetarian menu pleased our table greatly although the tofu dish was bland.

The security then decided to let us in on the exception it was 'Valentine day'.  After going outside to take a look at the view from the outside area we went inside to get a drink from the bar, after queing for only a few minutes i asked if they sold pina coladas. I was rudely thrown a cocktail menu and told to look before i order.  After deciding to order a bottle of beer for myself and a sambatini for my girlfriend the bartender proceeded to make 2 sambatinis which i then told him i only wanted 1 as i had the bottle of beer. He then threw the drink and glass straight into the bin out of frustration, the guy in question was a male who i belived to be italian or spanish and was very rude.  After finally paying for the 2 drinks, which may i add cost an extortionate \u00a322.50, we finished those and swiftly made our way for the exit.

Couldn't fault their recommendations. The burst of flavours was delightful and we could have carried on eating except for the fact that we wanted to save space for desserts!

Firstly, the menu offered was sub par, the selection of sashimi is simply terrible, how can a supposed high end restaurant not have otoro?or even just plain tuna? We ordered the uni and ikura (salmon egg) sashimi, and i have to say i could have bought better quality sushi at a local fishmonger. For our main course we had the wagyu, and I must say the only acceptable part of it was the pickled plums which had a rich flavour. I specifically asked for mine to be medium rare, meaning I expect to see a notch of red and pink, not a well done overcooked steak. The main point of eating wagyu is the succulent taste, and tang the juices give off with the rich meat, not a flat iron steak I can buy in NYC for 20 dollars anywhere. Finally I DO NOT expect to be argued with by waiters, then being forced to pay a 12% service charge. The waitress dared to argue back on our selection of drinks when a female client asked for vermouth to be mixed in with her drink. If a client asks for a hint of vermouth which has an extremely low shop price, we simply do not expect an argument saying \"vermouth kills the taste of the cocktail\".

She was dealing with us as if we were nuisance. It took us ages to grab any of the waiters attention. It was really frustration in the end I really wanted the bill, left without dessert cause it seems that to grab a menu was a difficult job for the waitress to do.  Conclusion, never again. Nothing here that Zuma, Hakasan or Novikov couldn't give me without the attitude or the long drive. ", "date_of_review": "29 January 2015"}

The staff were more than happy to let us move and this was great - the experience wouldn't have been the same where we were originally seated so very grateful for that! We had a couple of cocktails and were recommended to order plates to share. We particularly enjoyed the black cod (really is to die for), Wagyu tataki with foie gras and a fried quail egg (see pics) and the fish tacos. The sushi was good but not the best - it comes across overcomplicated which to me made it seem less fresh (especially when it had warm toppings). Overall the food was great and so was the service. The bill wasn't too bad - about 80 quid each which I'd say is very reasonable. I would definitely return and look forward to trying different items on the menu.", "date_of_review": "1 February 2015"}

As huge fans of Yo Sushi, we were excited to visit Sushi Samba, although after scanning the menu online we realised \u00a340 wasn't going to stretch too far. Neither of us have ever been 'fine diners', opting for bar meals rather than fancy restaurants, but this place was highly recommended to us. I put on a nice frock for our visit - and I was glad I didn't rock up in my leggings! The view from the restaurant is amazing - not that we saw much of it as we were sat as far from a decent view as possible! The waiters are very 'hands on', too involved and too fussy - but this is just not what we are used to, I felt quite uncomfortable but once we had ordered our first round of food, we didn't care! I ordered some kind of terriyaki fillet steak (rare) and to share, some sushi rolls. The beef was amazing. Amazing. We ordered some more kinds of sushi - all very good.  The bill came to \u00a397 and I almost fell off my chair. But to visit Sushi Samba, you should know you'll leave with a lighter purse.  After we ate, we stepped out on to the terrace to experience the view. To be honest - the view was better from the lift. For a one-time experience, Sushi Samba was great. The food really was amazing but on any normal day, I wouldn't pay the prices here. Definitely visit - even if just for the view. Apparently they do good cocktails too.", "date_of_review": "24 January 2015"}

Like that film that friends raved about that you went to see which you thought was rubbish. Or that incredible restaurant with the amazing views across London with food that melts in the mouth only to find that you thought it was underwhelming. Well in the case of Sushisamba, it does for once live up to the hype. Everyone I spoke to was gushing in their of this restaurant and I now know why. The food here is just insanely good. The menu was hard to decipher so we took the risk of allowing our waitress to choose for us - a huge leap of faith! The dishes just kept coming over a period of an hour and a half and I can honestly say I've not tasted food this good. EVER. The black cod was out of this world. To be fair, it all was. Delicate flavours, textures and colours the likes of which you will not seen before. I was pleasantly surprised at the prices too. When the bill came it worked out to be \u00a380 per head including a **mountain of food**, plenty of alcohol and 12.5% service, which given the quality of the fare offered up was worth every single penny. The only tiny gripe was that we were told in advance that our table was only available for our use for a maximum of 2.5 hours. When the 2.5 hours were up, we told in no uncertain terms that we had to leave as the next party of six had arrived. Having just given them over \u00a3500 we thought this was a bit mean spirited but understood and reluctantly moved through to the bar. It didn't spoil our evening though and we'd would highly recommend to our friends and will definitely return again.", "date_of_review": "25 January 2015"}

The staff are beyond wonderful: efficient, friendly, polite, fast. There was such a wonderful buzz, we loved every minute, even before the food came.

And above all, I thought the meal was very good value !  THE BAD The black cod is a bit of a let down, and inferior to say Zuma\u2019s. The green tea is vile, and made more unpalatable by the price of 7 quid a cup. THE UGLY: After what was a great night, great food, laughs with the staff, we were giddy and giggly with happiness and walked through the bar, checking out the terrace, debating whether to have a nightcap there, going to the loo \u2026 the usual \u2026 but what was unusual and horrible was the presence of \u2018minders\u2019 or bodyguards who were hovering around behind us, looking disapprovingly (no we were not loud and lairy, we don\u2019t drink alcohol and my mother who is 80 was with us). They followed us around as if we were trespassing, and so intimidating were they that we decided against the nightcap and fled, before they ruin our lovely evening. I must say that was a very strange experience that I am going to email the restaurant separately, as I\u2019ve not experienced anything quite like this.  Don\u2019t let that put you off what is a really fun experience. Will I go there again ?

I'm personnally not a fan of expensive restaurants that charge you a lot of money for a meal the size of a green pea. But I guess it's all about the experience, and I can't deny that it's quite impressive. In terms of food, it was very tasty. We tried the Kobe beef (super expensive but so good!), some taquitos that were lovely!, samba rolls. Honestly I've tasted much better rolls in London and at a much cheaper price. So yes, tasty food, but not super impressed. Our waitress (shame I don't remember her name) was really nice and gave us good recommendations. We were lucky to have a table with a great view by the window, the only problem was that we were right under the ventilation, so it was a bit chilly. Our waitress offered to use a blanket though.

When you arrive you head up to the restaurant in a glass lift which provides fantastic views of London! Unfortunately the previous people hadn't quite finished their meal, so we were apologised to and asked if we wouldnt mind waiting in the bar. They were very polite and apologetic and the bar was pretty with a nice ambiance so we ordered two cocktails and took a seat. Less than ten minutes waiting and we were escorted to our table. The restaurant is gorgeous with nice lighting and beautiful views across London. There is background music, but it is not so loud you can't have a conversation - it just helps to provide a vibe. We took a seat and was immediately given two glasses of champagne on the house to apologise for the wait and as a celebratory treat for the special occasion (really nice surprise!). We were introduced to our waiter and then the floor manager who checks on each table. We both are not particularly familiar with the cuisine, but our waiter listened to what we did and didn't like and made some suggestions (its best to order between 5-8 small plates between two). We went with his suggestions and were very pleased, each and every dish was delicious! We also went for dessert and were both very pleased. The waiter had heard earlier that it was my boyfriends birthday and so brought over a complimentary happy birthday macaroon, candle and Happy Birthday message which was an unexpected and nice touch. Price wise we found it really reasonable, but as I know everyone has different budgets I will give you an idea of pricing. We had: 5-6 small dishes, including black cod. Two cocktails Bottle of water Two desserts Expresso Total: 133 and that included 12.5 percent service charge The service was impeccable from start to end, the food was served fast, the ambience is nice and the settings were lovely.

My friends wife didnt want the over zealous chap pouring her drink and ended up having to guard it like a lioness guards her cubs, which the staff oddly found quite amusing. At one stage even the security guy seemed to be waiting on us! Onto the food.. Oh dear. We started with a signature house cocktail. It tasted like alco Sunny D basically. Any present flavours of plum infused sake were drowned out. I let my friend order for us as it was his first time. We all agreed the Kobe mini burgers and tacos were pretty good. We were still smiling at this stage. With everything else, around 10 small dishes in all, the flavours were ill thought out and came amateurishly presented. The fish skewers with corn were barely edible, drowned in oil/overdone didnt taste fresh. The kobe slices were similarly drowned in an 'ice cream' sauce and I think that one came with torn up stale tasting bread, soaked in squid ink.  The pudding.. It had 'Rio' in the title.. The friends wife exclaimed \"that's got to be the worst presentation I have ever seen, it looks just like s**t wiped on the edge of a toilet bowl\" And she was right.  300 quid for 3.

My first experience was good but nothing to shout about so I decided to have a go again. The evening hasn't started well. Our table has been delayed but nobody came to apologise or inform us how long will we be waiting. We were not really bothered though as we went to get a drink at the bar. We were served by one of the bar managers- really nice guy and his cocktails were delicious. After a while we've been approached by one of the host and taken to our table. We were sat right in front of kitchen which was probably the worst table in a restaurant. No view at all.  It took a while to get any sort of attention of our waitress- polish lady not very pleasant! So here we are, waiting 45 min for our table, being sat at the worst table in a restaurant and being served by a lady that was not bothered to smile one bit. Our evening took a whole different direction when one of the managers- Otto approached our table. He could see we were not impressed and his only intention was to make it right.  He managed to change our table to one by the window and ultimately our server has changed also.  We were looked after by couple of Jacob's and it was amazing. Both of them were such a nice guys but still overshadowed by Otto who was running his own show in the restaurant. You could see him joking with us, other tables and his staff and he created such a nice unforgettable atmosphere.

When you arrive you head up to the restaurant in a glass lift which provides fantastic views of London! Unfortunately the previous people hadn't quite finished their meal, so we were apologised to and asked if we wouldnt mind waiting in the bar. They were very polite and apologetic and the bar was pretty with a nice ambiance so we ordered two cocktails and took a seat. Less than ten minutes waiting and we were escorted to our table.  The restaurant is gorgeous with nice lighting and beautiful views across London. There is background music, but it is not so loud you can't have a conversation - it just helps to provide a vibe. We took a seat and was immediately given two glasses of champagne on the house to apologise for the wait and as a celebratory treat for the special occasion (really nice surprise!). We were introduced to our waiter and then the floor manager who checks on each table.  We both are not particularly familiar with the cuisine, but our waiter listened to what we did and didn't like and made some suggestions (its best to order between 5-8 small plates between two). We went with his suggestions and were very pleased, each and every dish was delicious! We also went for dessert and were both very pleased.  The waiter had heard earlier that it was my boyfriends birthday and so brought over a complimentary happy birthday macaroon, candle and Happy Birthday message which was an unexpected and nice touch. Price wise we found it really reasonable, but as I know everyone has different budgets I will give you an idea of pricing. We had: 5-6 small dishes, including black cod. Two cocktails Bottle of water Two desserts Expresso Total: 133 and that included 12.5 percent service charge The service was impeccable from start to end, the food was served fast, the ambience is nice and the settings were lovely.

I'm a massive sushi fan and had been looking forward to going for a long time. Going up in the glass lift is not for the faint hearted/people afraid of heights but is a very quick journey. The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, there are lots of tables so there is a bit of a buzz and good atmosphere, but also has the feel of being really open and airy. We were sat in a window seat which was absolutely fantastic as even though it was dark it was still a beautiful view of the twinkling lights of the London sky line. I had previously been very cynical of the fusion concept but decided to just give it a go and was guided by the waiter. We had a mixture of hot plates and cold plates, as well as sushi. All of the food was absolutely delicious and varied, it's definitely exciting if you're looking for something different to the standard fare. The one thing which my Dad and I didn't like was the butterfish sashimi. Butterfish is a beautiful fish to eat but they'd cut the sashimi much thicker than normal. This gave it a really rubbery texture and it was all a bit much. But everything else was really lovely, and the waiters were really helpful and friendly. If, like us, it's all a bit rich for your blood then don't faint too much when you look at the prices of the wine list. We had a glass of plum sake each (and the beer price isn't too bad) and they weren't too pricey. But some tables were necking down bottles of wine at hundreds of pounds so definitely a rich client\u00e8le.

The room is not particularly large, with tables for two around the edges and larger tables in the middle. Service throughout was prompt and professional, not too intrusive. Perfect for us. Ordered seven small plates between us which was sufficient, consisting of ribs, mixed ceviche, temaki and rolls. All exquisitely prepared with stunning flavour combinations, The Samba London roll was a particular highlight, with the ceviche the least accomplished of our selection being a little bland and floating in too much of its own juice. In terms of drinks the bar is very popular with the business set and the flavours again are fresh and beautifully thought out, though very sweet so may disappoint hardcore cocktail lovers.

Staff are friendly, know what they are doing but be prepared to wait to be served as there are not many staff to the ratio of people.  The restaurant itself if clean and bright.

I was very embarrassed being called out in front of all the other diners. I spoke to his manager who denied that he had asked his waiter to do that, apologised profusely and gave us a round of drinks. It really spoilt our evening and I won't be returning given all the above.", "date_of_review": "30 December 2014"}

When they phoned to confirm two days earlier, I was pleased to be able to secure a booking for 6.15 after I asked if there was anything earlier. So cool, 6.15 booking sorted. We arrived early enough to have drinks in the bar area and admire the awesome views. The decor and views were truly spectacular. We were sat at our table on time and then the waiter spilled one of our beers over. No apology, just wiped it up. I would have thought he might offer another beer, but he didn't. Drinks were so overpriced - \u00a37 a beer; he must have spilt about \u00a33 of it.  Anyway, he took our orders and then plates came at various times. They try to have a 'tapas' kind of thing going, where people share plates, but that's not possible really when someone is vegetarian and can't partake in what we're eating, and another person is eating meat and others eat fish. I mean, if you can't get all the orders out at the same time, then just say so? If we wanted to go to a tapas bar, we would go there. One person's sea urchin sashimi didn't arrive, so we had to feed him our rolls to keep him from passing out from hunger. His salmon nigiri didn't come either. We asked waiters as they came past (interestingly, the original waiter pretty much avoided us after spilling our beer and taking our orders). One waiter said the beef and sea urchin were coming later. Then another one didn't know where the sea urchin was, then another one brought seven nigiri, which no one ordered but it appears they must have misheard our friend say 'seven nigiri' instead of 'salmon nigiri' and refused to take it back to the kitchen, saying he must have it! So the poor guy so far hasn't had his sea urchin and has got the wrong order, but ate it anyway because he was hungry. We asked another waiter where the sea urchin was and he asked, 'haven't you had it already?' Um, no. Finally, we got an answer out of one of the waiters - there was no sea urchin! Why they couldn't just tell us that from the outset I don't know. No apology again. So I said that is unacceptable. If he'd known it wasn't available, he would have ordered something else - he's sat the whole evening thinking it was coming! The waiter said he'd get the manager. Manager came, again no real apology but he could get one dessert free. This wasn't very impressive to him of course, as he'd had no real meal, but he accepted. Then 6 glasses of Prosecco came as well, which the waiter said hoped 'would put a smile on our faces'. We weren't grumpy or anything, mostly just bemused by the fact that not one waiter told us that sea urchin wasn't in fact available two hours after we ordered it. It was almost like they were hoping we wouldn't notice and would be charged for it. The bill came and it was lovely to see that the 'discretionary' service charge of 12.5% had been applied to our table. Not sure what service we had really, from spilling our beer to getting our order wrong and then not providing one of the orders and failing to tell us it wasn't available, and then no apologies for any of the errors.  Anyway, we can now say we've been here, and that it is indeed average. Other than the awesome views, the food is very tasty but not good value for money. I couldn't believe how small the beef fillet was!", "date_of_review": "30 December 2014"}

Note: you have to book well in advance to guarantee time and slot you want and I already knew this so that helped, but it is all done online so no snooty phone tennis:) The nice thing about this place is that there is a LOT of staff, someone to take your coat, then someone to walk you though, then a waiter, and if you come in the evening there is someone in the lift, someone at the door etc. You're never left to walk around aimlessly. If you don't want attention then don't come here! I was with a friend and we had 4 cocktails between us and a nice lunch and with service - came to \u00a3150. I don't often spend \u00a375 on lunch but every now and then why not. Cocktails are really a highlight and at \u00a314 ish each - puts to shame those London establishments that stick a novice on the bar to make standard forumlaic cocktails at the same price. If you're going to spend \u00a314 on a drink - only do it where they employ expert cocktail makers, like here. Food was tasty but I've had nicer food at Ceviche, Andina and Nobu for less money, however I am a bit spoilt when it comes to food:) Very impressed to see REAL crab in the Calfornia rolls as opposed to crab sticks - I would hope so, but you just never know. Lobster taquitos were a festive special and amazing at that but just tiny and at \u00a314 for two tiny shells, it is a bit of a liberty, and that is probably where Ceviche shines a bit brighter- it is a lot more 'value for money'.  Would I come again? Yes! The great service and amazing cocktails helped smooth over my tiny annoynaces about teeny portions etc. Decor and views are unique and we saw a celebrity on our visit which added to the glamour:)", "date_of_review": "30 December 2014"}

Tried 3 kinds of rolls, coconut rice and scallop seviche - everything absolutely delicious, great selection of wines by the glass!

Lovely terrace, but may be closed if it's windy outside. I would say this is THE place for a romantic date (especially the 2-person tables right by the panoramic window).

We were directed to the restaurant reception in the distance where we were 'greeted' by two girls who looked equally as stressed, but mixed with a bit of anger and disdain. I felt like I had approached two people who had just had an argument and my opinion and presence was far from welcome.....I knew we were in for a bumpy ride. I was told instantly that there was a \"delay on all tables tonight\", with no apology. I was given this info in a very matter of fact fashion, in almost the same way that airlines inform you of a 2 hour delay. Tough luck, it's too late, your bags are checked in. We were shown to the bar area which was naturally busy at this time of year, and ordered drinks from the very efficient bar staff. No complaints here. We managed to grab a table by the window and were approached by the waitress who had obviously been hanging out with the cloak room girl and the two girls on reception for too long. Perhaps she was involved in the argument. She looked stressed, tired and frankly like she wanted to be anywhere other than sushi samba. No smile, no warm hospitality. I wanted to give her a hug and send her home early. Eventually we ate, but after a 20 minute wait. The food was good. Mediocre and expensive. It is almost like the food is here to act as a side show to the view, which it shouldn't....especially at \u00a315 a plate of sushi. I know better than most how stressed and tired staff can get in December in the restaurant/bar industry in London as I managed 15 large west end based venues for a number of years with hundreds of staff. Staff are exhausted by the first week of December by the relentless influx of drunk, hungry and loud guests that don't stop coming.....but for some reason the staff at sushi samba aren't happy, in fact they are clearly unhappy. This made me unhappy. If you want exquisite Japanese food in central London then go elsewhere, if you want a good view and a good cocktail then come here.

The place was quite busy, as one expects at this time of the year, but it didn't spoil the experience and rather enhanced it. The bar is well-stocked with some rather unusual features (e.g. a wide selection of Japanese whiskeys), the service at the bar is quick and no-nonsense. As you proceed to the dining area, your impressions start to go downhill. While the atmosphere, the decor, and the overall ambiance are still there, both the cuisine and the service let you down. As far as the latter is concerned, the major problem is the lengthy waiting periods in between the courses. It could well be 15-20 minutes after the plates have been cleared that the next course is placed on your table... and you discover it is lukewarm. The waiters do try to be helpful and engaging but they rarely succeed in being efficient at the same time. The service gets slower and slower as the evening progresses, which is rather bizarre taking into account how busy the place is and how difficult it is to book a place there. In the end, having spent more than 3 hours there, we deiced to leave without the pudding: the wait became excruciating. After having waited 15 min extra to be seated (now, I can understand why: with the speed of service they have, it is a wonder that anyone gets a seat at all), we were guided to our table... No excuses were offered though, and not a single smile either. As for the cuisine, it is mixed and, overall, a rather sad affair. The fusion of Japanese and Latin American has been tried before many times and with very mixed results. Ten years after it first arrived to London shores, the novelty of the idea has pretty much worn off, taking away 90% of all the excitement. You are not surprised anymore but, as you know quite well what you'll get, your expectations regarding the standards of cooking get high. This is when the disappointment kicks in. Firstly, as I have said before, uneven and chaotic service does not contribute to the experience. Dishes arrive out of order (course number 4 before course number 3, for example) with some of them being almost cold. The portions that are supposed to be shared by the diners ofter are of grudgingly small size as if they have been intended originally for individual rather than communal enjoyment. Having had half of the meal, you are left with a distinct impression that the meal hasn't started yet and you've been enjoying drinks with nibbles instead. \"The order of the service\" is also rather ill-thought: for example, sushi are being served just before the dessert course (the one that we've decided to abandon) and after the main course. Sushi's position in the menu was so obviously wrong and out of place that several people at our table checked the menu to make sure there were no mistake. Secondly, the cooking is disappointing. Take the sushi course, for example. Wassabi that goes with it is so mild that one can barely taste it, say nothing about the expectation of heat and full flavour. Hamachi Kama (char-grilled collar of the yellowtail fish) is charred rather than grilled and it did arrive at out table stone-cold. Shrimp tempura had the appearance and the taste of a \"out-of-the-bag-quickly-microwaved-grub\" with now crispiness at all. Churrasco Rio Grande was served hot (for a change) but that was the best thing one can say about the plate: while the presentation was striking (the meats resting on a bed of hot stones), the plates themselves (we've ordered several) were cooked to different standards (one of them was between \"medium\" and \"well done\" while the other one was \"medium rare\") and the meats were of different standards themselves too: one of the rib-eyes was barely edible. This is where another service saga started: an answer to the routine question of a waiter \"How is you meat?\" (\"This rib-eye is not particularly good\") provoked a defensive and lengthy tirade from the waiter advocating the good standard of the dish. Obviously, he was right while at least 4 people around the table were wrong. No polite excuses were offered at this time either. When we decided to finish the meal without the pudding and asked for the remaining sushi to be packed in a takeaway bag, the best entertainment of evening followed. One of the waiters readily agreed to do so before disappearing altogether. Some half an hour later, another waiter, after being prompted, claimed that wouldn't be possible as this type of service wasn't customary at the place. A small group of grumpy waiters (c.f. an unkindness of ravens) turned up at the table demanding a physical description of the server who had previously agreed to do the honours. By the look of their faces, if identified, the renegade would have been lynched. It was hilarious.  Overall, these dramas didn't spoil the evening but that was owing to the company at the table rather than cuisine or service. Sadly, after my first visit to this place, I can confidently say that I won't be coming back there any time soon: there are plenty of similarly interesting venues around enjoying the same, if not better, views over London and cosmopolitan and busy ambiance and offering much better standards of service as well as much more refined and interesting cuisine. Even more sadly, I can't recommend this place for a dinner either.", "date_of_review": "9 December 2014"}

We had to schedule it a month in advance, as there were no reasonable hours available for a dinner (availability for the whole month was only after 10pm). Busy place, nice reviews, looked like it would be a nice family dinner in a special place! Actually, it was a big mistake. Loud place, with a crowded, sophisticated, under-served, expensive for its value, and noisy bar in the entrance, an incompetent reception desk with two under-trained staff members, who nicely explained to us that our reservation for 21:15 would be delayed by 15 minutes. Not bad, 15 minutes, right? Wrong! After several \"15 minutes\" later, after a lot of arguing at the reception desk with the rude Brazilian and its kind but completely lost and incompetent companion, we finally got a table after a 65 minutes waiting time! A manager came helping the incompetent duo and found us the \u201cbest available table\u201d, right in front of the robata kitchen, a very smokey experience! A while later they told us we could move to a \"better\" table, which was much smaller compared to the initial one, but we took anyway just to get away from the smoke. As a matter of compensation, he offered us two glasses of champagne and some appetisers, which we took, and a 100 Pounds voucher for our next meal at the place, which I declined telling him I had no intention of ever going back there, with such customer treat! Food menu is a mix of Brazilian, Japanese and Peruvian cuisines. Nice proposition right? Well, the food was good, but the bill was very expensive as the sake and beverages in general are very expensive. Value for the money definitely not worth. I have been to several nice and expensive restaurants, all worth their prices, but this one is sort of a tourist-trap with the promise of a nice view. Only good thing on this restaurant was the waiter Pablo, who tried his best to make us happy. Two words: never again!!", "date_of_review": "7 December 2014"}

We washed it down with a lovely Hungarian souvignon blanc recommended to us by our waiter. The food on the day was delicious but too expensive for what it was.

Great views though!", "comment": "I had no intention of dining at SushiSamba this evening, I thought I had made a reservation for Duck & Waffle on the next floor up, but they couldn't find our booking when we arrived. I showed them the email and they told me it was for SushiSamba instead. First disappointment of the evening, as I had made the reservation two months ago and had been looking forward to the meal for quite some time. This was not to be the last disappointment. We went downstairs and joined a queue to 'check in' with the host. We waited quite some time. In the mean time, a typical city slicker joined the queue beside us. We were almost jockeying for position as he kept trying to push ahead of us. Another member of staff swanned over to the desk and opened up another till just for him while we were left to wait for minutes more. It turned out he didn't even have a reservation and he was told to wait in the bar. We were told our table wasn't quite ready and directed to the bar. A long queue had formed and there was a suit behind us blocking the aisle with a suitcase. As I started to step round him a member of staff came bustling over and stood right in my way without acknowledging me at all while she fussed over the man's suitcase. We were actually touching, not once did she look up and say \"sorry\" or \"excuse me\". Awkward! The bar staff are vacant and unchivalrous and give off the vibe that THEY are doing YOU a favour by letting you into their fancy restaurant. No one gives you right of way when moving around. Whilst seated, a waitress came over and very pointedly put serviettes under our drinks, but failed to do this to any of the other adjoining tables. We had arrived at about 6:45 for out 7:00 table. At 7:20 we were still waiting to no avail. We weren't sure this whether we were supposed to go back at a certain time or whether someone was coming to get us. No offer was made to take our coats so we had to sit with them awkwardly. The service in the restaurant was much better, the waiters were very attentive, although it seems to be a big free for all as to who serves which area. We were asked multiple times if we wanted drinks or were ready to order, they really need a better system here.  The food was just okay, I can't comment too much on that - I am no sushi expert. The fusion concept seems gimimck-y however, I'd rather have gone to a Wahaca. The restaurant experience almost made up for the bad time at the bar, were it not for the fact that as we were finishing our desert the head waiter came over and told us he would need the table back in 10 minutes, so we were rushed out. We had barely stood up from the table when the next party were being shown to our seats!  Pretentious, disingenuous staff. Perhaps this is actually part of the City experience? New marketing angle? We considered leaving feedback at the time but didn't think anyone would care enough to address it. Maybe through writing this review I can help someone to make a better choice, although I am sure it will have no bearing on the restaurant's coffers as city bores and mediocre IT-crowd types flock here in their droves. To add insult to injury, I have now checked my emails, and I DID email Duck & Waffle for a reservation. Fantastic!", "date_of_review": "2 December 2014"}

Sushi Samba is one of the 'hottest' restaurants in the square mile, and is notoriously difficult to secure a booking for. Here's the good and the bad - but in a nutshell, there are better places to spend your money on in London.  THE GOOD. - The view needs to be mentioned up front. It really is that good.  - The dining room is lovely - light, airy, and with most tables giving you a great vantage point for making the most of the view. It's noisy though - this isn't a snug little romantic bolt hole, so you need to be prepared for buzz and chatter.  - The food in the restaurant is great - but not spectacular. Prices are high, but the sushi, sashimi and ceviche are fresh and tasty. The grill / robarta fare is average for the price - you can eat much nicer Peruvian style / Latin American food at better restaurants with less pretension in London, Andina or Ceviche being a good example.  THE BAD - The prices. The food, and especially the cocktails, just aren't good enough to justify the prices. You can get spectacular cocktails in London for around the 8 pound mark, and Sushi Samba's standard price is around 14 pounds. For that, I expect mixology magic.  - The Bar - whilst I'm talking about the drinks, the bar here is dreadful. The staff are rude and pretentious, the service bad and the wait to get a drink appalling when they charge through the nose. Particularly when you've spent several hundred pounds dining with them, it's a bit galling to get attitude when you order a night cap. Again - this is London, there are much better bars you can drop your cash at.  - The crowd. Oscillates between happy snapper tourists in jeans and runners and pretentious investment banker types wearing suits with their ties loosened. Really not my scene, and detracts from the chic atmosphere Sushi Samba is trying to cultivate. A much better crowd and atmosphere 10 minutes up the road in Hackney.  Overall, I'd rate Sushi Samba as 'overrated'. I've been there 3 times now, and I think my last visit will remain just that - my last visit.", "date_of_review": "2 December 2014"}

The decor is nice, the ride up in the lift with a view of the city is worth something by itself and the ambience is excellent. A noisy buzz with nice music and attentive but not pushy staff - we were also engaged Maitre'd who asked us whether we were enjoying ourselves, which I like. And the food (the point of the exercise) is, well, unremarkable and left me slightly wondering what all the fuss was about. Excellent ingredients that somehow seem to add up to less than the sum of its parts. We had tempura prawns, mixed cerviche, blackened cod (recommended) and the \u00a345 mixed beef on hot stones number, which to be honest probably isn't.  So in summary, very nice and an enjoyable experience but not better than lots of other places which I think I thought it would be. You'll have a nice evening, and without the waiting list and a notch or two down on the price I'd go again. But there are better places to pick in London's wide selection so the suggestion would that unless you really want the in crowd experience to pick one of them.", "date_of_review": "23 November 2014"}

It really is one of the best restaurants in London. I was really lucky to get in at short notice. It was really busy when we got there on a soggy Winter Wednesday night. The bars (inside and out) were heaving so it was hard to get a drink within 20 minutes so I went straight to the table in the restaurant. We got a great table (no view I'm afraid as the clouds had come in). The atmosphere was wonderful. At night the restaurant is very romantic. The service was excellent - the sushisamba waiters all have great personalities and are very enthusiastic about their jobs and the food and can't do enough to help you. The manager Otto came to say hello and thank me for coming back which was a lovely touch. My boyfriend hadnt been there before and the waiters do an excellent job of guiding you through the menu and highlighting the extra special dishes. The shrimp tempura, yellowtail tirodito and black cod miso are must haves if you love fish. We also had the tiger maki roll and the wagyu beef. There was not one thing we could complain about. The wine was fantastic and they kept us topped up all night. I can't rave about this place enough.

The first challenge was the lift, fastest in Europe apparently and strapped to the outside of the building, not for the faint hearted but much easier on the stomach than the roller-coaster reputation it has. The next challenge was the bar, the 38th floor where the restaurant is located had a hectic cocktail bar inside and an overpriced champagne bar on the terrace. We waited patiently for the bar staff to take out order and my wife was ignored twice by the surly waitress, thankfully I had wandered up to the bar on the 39th which was less busy and far quicker to be served. The cocktails were tasty and original even though we did find it difficult to find someone willing to take an order for a second round. The off to the table for dinner, the restaurant is basically a big glass box on top of the building so acoustics can be a little hard and hence it was a god send when the waitress offered to look after us novices and recommend a menu. Her choices were fabulous and we felt we really had an opportunity to try all tat was unique to this venue. The service at the table was fantastic, attentive but not overbearing, even to the point of sticking a candle in my pudding with Happy Birthday written on it.

I ordered a wine but I asked her if it is dry as I wanted dry wine with the food but actually was quite fruity and sweet.  We had a good evening overall but as I am a restaurant manager and had high expectations for this place I am quite disappointed.

It was my wife's birthday and she adores Sushi so this place looked the bomb. This is place is literally by Liverpool Street Station (Central Line - Famous for weekly suicides...) anyway, it's a 5 minute walk from there and even before you get in there are 2 bouncers and a crowd of groupies trying to negociate to get on the evening's diners list. Firstly, there is a glass elevator which allows you to see a nice bit of London, once you get in the service from the staff really couldn't have been better. From the moment you walk in, your treated like royalty any issue is not a problem, we were promptly seated (Make sure you request seats by the window for a nice view). While my wife went away, the waiter asked me whether it was a special occasion, when saying it was her birthday and without me evening asking he said when you order a dessert we will put happy birthday on, wife was delighted when this happened later in the evening. The waiter and staff were extremely informative, explaining the menu in depth, giving recommendations and always keeping good eye for detail. Now, lets get to the food. My wife is the master of sushi and extremely picky about it, she said the sushi here was the best she had ever, this includes sushi she had in Asia. I on the other hand hate sushi, if your sushi lover we suggest you go for Sao Paulo known as the 'Samba Rolls'. If your not a sushi lover try the starters of Wagyu Gyoza this dumplings are out of this world! The thing with this place, which differs from other western/asia restaurants is that the food you chose is based on the Spanish Tapas, so we suggest you pick a number of dishes and share. The only food, which I was disappointed with was 'Robata - Black Cod' it's grilled but the smokiness is far too much, which destroys the taste, if you do try this, what ever you do dont put the bloody lime on it, wrong choice. Apart from this all the sushi and cooked food we had was well above standard, perfect. Drinks wise, my wife went for a cocktail, Lychee Cooler, which was tasty, I went for Matcha-Pisco, another amazing choice by my wife but I chose an awful one as the Matcha was extremely bitter, to save disappointment, go for the champayne. Our bill was around \u00a3150 thats for a helping for 2 people, 2 cocktails and desserts. Well worth it and would have gladly paid over \u00a3200 for it.

The salmon (cooked) and mozzarella roll is very unique, worth a try if you're looking for something very different. Other roles are not as unique but still very good - I particularly enjoyed the spicy tuna and spicy crab rolls. From rhe hot dishes the seabass tempura was very well done, but I wouldn't bother with the hot stone wagyu (meat is only good, portion size very small).

Obviously we didn't expect to go to a cheap restaurant but I think they can win an award for the most expensive green tea ever (which is in fact not a proper green tea but a powder tea or something similar)...\u00a38.50 for a glass, no refill, literally this is the price for a tiny glass of boiled water. We got the assorted raw fish ... \u00a323 for 6 tiny extremely thin pieces of fish (literally you could see through them). Ate in many Sushi places but the fish was so thin you couldn't even taste it.... We had a tiny bottle of sake for \u00a335....and they couldn't even keep it warm and therefore got cold after 5 mins... The only thing that was worth the money was the dessert which was a good portion. Service wise, all looked really good at the beginning, our waitress introduce herself and told us she was going to look after us but then never saw her again.... So not sure what that was about. I told them at time of booking this was our first wedding anniversary and no one mentioned or did anything for us. Didn't expect a cake or anything, but a \"congratulation\" would have been nice, just to recognise us considering I also sent them an email before coming.

But then, the maitre d' arrives with a platter with two glasses of prosecco and your off. Tables by the windows are considered the best in the house boasting breath-taking views over London's night sky. Atmosphere is created by booming music. Hmmm - not my taste BUT that is the vibe in the place and they do it well. Helpful waiter with proper recommendations who took into account what we did and didn't want to eat.  The raw fish was excellent. The vegetable salad was, frankly, poor - dirty carrot, a few leaves and a nondescript dressing lying in wait at the bottom of the bowl. The speed of service was well-paced (although the cut rolls take longer to arrive than any other item).  On the whole the food is really good - the portions are not enormous (although the cut rolls are generous).  You must understand that this is a top location, and it is \"sushi tapas\" in the style of Dinings (whilst never quite achieving the finesse of that restaurant, it beats it hands down for the sexy skyline location).

Wonderfully modern and ladies if you want to get dressed up and feel posh the bar and terrace is a great spot for a drink but be willing to pay for it. I went for a meal here last year, I had previously been for drinks here and was amazed by the views and venue - its beautiful. We were greeted and sat down straight away and was assigned our waiter who was unbelievably good at giving great service. I didn't have too look up once to get someone's attention - he was on the ball the whole time. Shame I cant remember hes name, anyway the waiter recommended lots of dishes so we said go for it and everyone was a explosion of new tastes I have never experienced before, was such an experience, me and my aunt had steak and the black cod and they were both to die for. we then had some plates of sushi which were just heaven, yeah this place is expensive but you get what you pay for its divine.

The lift up to floor 38 was great as you look out over London and not as ear popping quick as I had hoped. Where is the go faster button? Great decor awaited us, nicely decorated. The bar area low tools allowing people to sit and drink while taking in the panorama - selfie's being taken at will.  Bamboo lattice made a glass and steel building seem more authentic which was nice. I loved the orange ties on the staff contrasting with the black shirts - awesome brand colouring.  We were squeezed in before the booking for 1 hour which was great as 1 hour is sufficient as the service is prompt. As the menu is fusion - and again without really knowledge of starter/main/side we let the waiter guide us and he did a great job.  Crispy Taquitos - Yellow tail - these were small tacos filled with loveliness - rich guacamole, tuna, and a lovely corn miso foam - really nice - \u00a312 for these which were really two bites.  Anticuchos - flank Skirt - As Michel Roux grand dad said on his death bed - \" just a bit of skirt please\" meaning the flank steak - this is the butchers own cut and gorgeous - served medium though really more medium rare - melted in the mouth - delicious - \u00a317 for two skewers of three cubes - the corn accompaniment was fun too - big sweet corn Shrimp Tempura - sizeable bowl of food for 14 - lots of lightly batted prawns in a delicious dressing - my wife thought this was the best dish we had. Wagyu Tataki - was several thin slices of wagyu beef - just seared beautiful beef - didn't need chewing - just melted - top ingredients. Cooked foie gras never adds anything my view - same could have been achieved with cooked cheese. Nigri - tuna - similar to other places - however the tuna cooked really fresh and the wasabi was the real McCoy - not coloured horseradish - my nose was certiantly clear after that..wowsers.  Finally - we had the salted code fish cake balls - BOLINHOS DE BACALHAU - which were more potato than cod. Again a sizeable plate of food.  Overall - everything was served well.. Taquitos - best wow factor for eating with the eyes Prawns / Wagyu/ Flank for taste. Bill came to 95 for the two of us - without wine - just soda. 12.5% service automatically added.", "date_of_review": "10 November 2014"}

The bar is quite small and it took a while to get served but understandable as a popular place. The drinks were OK, but we felt the overall choice of cocktails was quite small in its offering. The problem we have is the layout of this place, The exit/entrance to the bar for the people working behind it is right next to the window, meaning that no customers can really stand here as its a walkway for the staff. Bizarre really as its the customers paying a premium for the drinks so that they can take in the views, but its the staff that benefit more!! Another problem which doesn't come across on other reviews is the large tree in the middle of the bar. Yes it does look great, however the tree is outside on the terrace, so you are out in the elements, great for summer but not so good for winter and wet weather. The lift is amazingly fast and the trip down in it is fab. You are speeding towards the ground and can see it coming towards you, then at the last moment the lift slows down and touchdown. What a rush. We'd probably go back to try the food, but the views are only great from inside near the bar as the views from the terrace are of north London and not much to see. They really need to sort the layout so that more customers can benefit from the great views over the Thames etc.", "date_of_review": "5 November 2014"}

Sushisamba has been around for some time now, but it is still notoriously difficult to get a table a couple of days before you want to go. Took us about 8 weeks \u2026 and even then could only book a Sat eve time slot around 23.30. On the positive side: we booked a table for 4 persons but our 3 friends whom we met up with for a drink at the bar beforehand were able to join.  Sushi Samba remains an experience. From the moment you get through the entrance and are being 'warped' to the 38th floor in a super-fast lift, you feel excited to be in London. The views are spectacular, especially at night. Before you head to the restaurant, you pass through a cool bar with an in- and outside area. Yes; drinks can be considered pricey, but it's London on a night out; what do you expect???  Let me skip straight to the more relevant info: the food and the dining experience. It is absolutely amazing. The upside of a big group is that you can share many, MANY dishes. So i would say i've tried a good portion of the menu. My verdict? \u2026. From the presentation to the bold flavors \u2026 you are in for an experience! My favorites? The black cod, the Poussin chicken and the El Topo samba roll. But i could have easily picked another 5 dishes to re-order. You know how you can tell that the food is great? Three reasons \u2026. number 1: people eagerly look forward to the next dish \u2026. number 2: people become quiet when they are tasting \u2026 and finally number 3: yummie noises followed by empty plates. :) In summary: it was a great night out. Staff was helpful to explain the menu but never too pushy. We all tried to guess the bill at the end of the evening and everyone was overestimating by at least 100 pounds, so the 'damage' was not that bad.

A fantastic selection of starters and sushi including rock shrimp tempura with a spicy mayo dressing which was beautiful.  The atmosphere is great, with loud Samba music playing on the back terrace overlooking the Gherkin. It made for an incredible evening. The staff in the restaurant were very attentive and the manager made a special effort to accommodate us when our reservation details changed, and ensured we had an excellent evening.

Suggested few items on the menu to try, wasn't pushy nor indifferent.  Food was up in 10 minutes with a brief description of what they were, and offered to plate up our dishes - Something you'd expect from a fine dining establishment but not an upmarket restaurant.  Food was amazing! Wasn't traditional Japanese but to be fair, they've never claimed to be. The fusion between Jap and Brazillian was a breath of fresh air. The only downer was green tea which came in at 8 pounds per cup. The price of food though was outstanding given its location and target market.

The sushi itself doesn't come cheap, and a meal for 2 with a glass of sake each will come to around \u00a380.

We had the passion fruit cake and 'with love from Rio' and shared these between 5 of us (not quite enough but we were all fairly full).

My view is perhaps slightly biased since I lived in Latin America for a couple of years. Firstly, a little history. Brazil is home to the world's largest Japanese community outside Japan, followed by Peru. The flood of migration began in the 1800s for various reasons. Thus it is no surprise that over time the mixing of cultures brought this new cuisine termed Nikkei. Thus the concept for me was not new at all. There are certainly other Nikkei restaurants in major cities. I give this place a point for raising the profile of this cuisine to the populous though.

I can't comment on the food or service in the restaurant but I wouldn't be in a hurry to revisit the place given some fundamental flaws in treatment of customers. We waited nearly half an hour to be served at the bar, not because it was 5 deep with people but because there was no awareness from the very few bar staff of who had been waiting the longest, so if you shouted across the bar at them, as most of the men did, you got served. When we did get served the service was brusk and given the price of the drinks it was disappointing that the manhattan was only just over half a glass full. To then find out that service was automatically included at over 10% added insult to injury. The bar staff all looked miserable and didn't engage with the customers at all. We asked what a drink was that a barman was making and he grunted at us. We wondered did the bar staff get the tips that customers were charged for. If so, they have no reason to be so grumpy and should make much more of an effort, if not then management is scandalous. If it hadn't been my daughter's birthday I would have spoken to the manager.

I was here for an event where we were swifty told to go to the back room which was small and cramped with far too many people and not enough space to move. It overlooked the restaurant which looked spectacular. Its bamboo ceilings are breathtaking. We tried a few canap\u00e9s which were very well presented and excellent quality. The only problem was there were no napkins to wipe away the sushi from your hands. A small bar was set up but no one was there to serve us. We wondered the entire restaurant and bar areas which was very busy. Stopped to take in the WOW views even from the ladies.

If I booked again, I would certainly asked to be placed at a table next to the window so that I could have a better view from up there. I read some comments that the staff and service were not very good, but we honestly had no issues. It was a saturday night and the place was packed, but still the service was good.

When me and my partner arrived we were sited by the sushi bar where we had a lovely cellection of sushi and drinks. Since we were expectiing one person to join us we have asked the waiter if we can take one extra chair on what we received an answear that she doesn\u2019t know and we should ask someone else. And she walked away. Really?! Well, being a nice customers we did what we have been told to do and asked someone else. Here was our luck and the gentelmen in a black suit was extreamly helpful! For what we say a big thank you! As we couldn\u2019t have an extra chair he relocated us to the lounge area were we have ordered some more food and drinks. Food arrived very quickly however drinks took ages. We have ordered two cocktails and a shot of tequilla. It took 20 min for the cocktails to arrive\u2026no sign of tequilla. I guess it was coming all the way from Mexico. Cocktails were not good at all and tasted more like a juice rather than an alcoholic drink. So basically paying \u00a314per drink you are getting a juice with the splash of alcohol in it \u2013great! My partner did send the drink back and it took another 15min for it to arrive but this time with the tequila. Let me point out that we were only 3 people at the table and there was only 5 tables occupied, so no excuse that they were slammed and the bar couldn\u2019t cope. Waiter didn\u2019t seem to care either. Unfortunately it did ruin the whole experience and we decided to leave and go elsewhere. Bill arrived very quickly. As I understood it was presented by the manager or a supervisor who very quitely said that he took tequilla and one cocktail off the bill, as we waited too long, and he left. No much of explanation or \u201cwe are sorry\u201d\u2026nothing! What to my oppinion is unexceptable for such a place as Sushi Samba. And guess what?! \u2013 the service charge was there.  Dear management, if the service is bad you need to remove it from the bill as your customers are paying for a good service not for a bad experience! At this point I would rather pay for the drinks than the service charge, as service was bad and you were well aware of it!!!", "date_of_review": "15 October 2014"}

Our main waiter was great, he suggested ordering 5-6 small dishes would be enough for 2. The food is a fusion of Japanese, Peruvian and Brazilian. I liked all the dishes that we had. There was a lot of googling beforehand at home as the menu has a lot of complicated names and dishes that I did not know the meaning of. But actually there was no need as each dish was explained to us when served. Service was on a very high level. There was a lot of staff, each time I got up/sat down, the chair was pulled for me. I asked where the toilet was and instead of usual pointing, I was actually taken to the door. Prices were not too bad either. For 6 small dishes, 2 deserts and a cocktail we paid \u00a3135.

The waiter was very cold towards us and after we mentioned it was our first time here he gave us 'recommendations', I understand he should try to up sell the items on the menu but recommending the most expensive items on the menu made us weary of his choices. We had a mix of Sushi and Samba but The 'Samba London' (rolls) turned out to be a great choice as we had a selection of different rolls with fresh fish and well steamed rice.  The waiters (as opposed to the bar staff outside) were unfriendly, offered a rushed service and did not seem to care that we were there (or the tables around us for that matter).  As we had been rushed by both waiters serving us you would have expected them to bring the bill out quickly but we had to wait over 15 minutes to get the bill and another 5 minutes for them to bring the change.

The venue was amazing with its fun, vibrant and playfully chic decor & the view was spectacular showing off the City of London. The service was friendly, prompt and knowledgable with no up sales. But the food was what draws you to really come to SUSHISAMBA. We had at our table the following: Shiso Fine cocktails w/ Green Bean tempura for a starter...Yum! Followed with Rock Shrimp Tempura, Wagyu Gyoza and the Tuna Sashimi Seviche....amazing! Then came out the Samba Rolls staring the London Roll, El Topo and S\u00e3o Paulo....all beautifully plated and out of this world. But of course you need dessert so out came the 'Chocolate Banana Cake' with Maple butter, plantain chips & vanilla rum ice cream and also 'With Love From Rio' with dark chocolate ganache, coffee mousse, tonka bean ice cream & caramelized macadamia.

However, upon arrival, we were (not very politely) told by the staff on the door that they couldn't let us in, \"because there are too many guys and it will make our ratio unbalanced\". I have three problems with this. Firstly, it's a restaurant, so surely \"ratios\" shouldn't matter. Secondly, they were assuming that all of us were heterosexual, and wanting to be with girls. And thirdly, they were assuming that the only reason we were going was to pull, and there has to be an equal number so that everyone can pull and be happy. The only thing I can see coming from this is more and more sexism and objectification, and if I'd known this was how they treat people who are willing to give them their money, I wouldn't have gone near the place.", "date_of_review": "24 September 2014"}

One of us is leaving the country soon and as a result we have pulled together a bucket list of 'must dos' in London before she goes. Sushi Samba was on that list, and we'd even taken a day off the next day so that time was not an issue. We arrived and to be honest felt instantly judged. We are not your typical city types, which seems to be what this restaurant caters for. We are however massive foodies and have eaten in fabulous restaurants worldwide. We were shown to our table and the staff were highly attentive, almost to the point of crowding us, but really cannot fault them. The food arrived almost one plate at a time which was a little infuriating but still not too annoying. I would say that the tiradito and black cod were delicious but the ceviche had no fish to speak of, the bacalao balls very mediocre and the sushi pretty sub standard to be honest. Neverless we enjoyed it and gobbled it up, really determined to enjoy our surroundings. I will also say that the cocktail at the start was amazing! We finished our mains and were then handed the pudding menu. We decided we were too full to have a pudding but that we would like a coffee and a glass of wine to finish off our night. Normally at any restaurant this is not an issue. Here however, we were told that the manager had asked if we could have the coffee and wine outside at the bar. When asked if they actually meant 'outside' as in on the terrace, the reply was yes. This was only two days ago and by 8 ish it was pretty chilly outside. We declined the offer and asked for the bill. When it arrived we asked for the service charge to come off being explicit that it was not the wait staffs fault, but their manager, who had essentially asked us to leave before our meal was finished. We called him over to the table to chat about it and were told that there were people waiting for our table. We could see actively free tables and also were aware that there were tables of 2, 4 and 6 sitting around us that had been there long before we even arrived. We were also asked 'if we've ever been to this type of restaurant before'? Which is just pretty insult in TBH. Overall we were made to feel pretty unwelcome and would certainly not be going back. If you like flashing the cash but don't really have much taste, this is the place for you. We went to the shard afterwards for a glass of fizz to cheer us up and the service there was on another level. Loved it!", "date_of_review": "24 September 2014"}

Sadly this did not materialise except for a few exceptions. Having read the website and statements in terms of experience , etiquette and service I disagree on this too. On arrival we were greeted well and shown to the lift, but shared a lift with a young group who were dressed very casual and was surprised when they entered the sushi Samba with us.  Once we arrived we were shown through to reception, where if I am honest I was frostily greeted by the host and told we have time before our meal and to go onto the terrace where we can have drinks. 15 minutes later, being ignored by the waiter to serve a group of women who arrived 5 minutes after us, we waited patiently, with one bar man and a lot of other guests forming a queue we decided to sit on our table and order drinks from there. Also, there was a foul smell close to the bar which may have been due to the bags of rubbish or cut up fruit I noticed below. I did make the reception host aware of the long wait for drinks but again we were greeted with a frosty answer. On the positive side, we were seated with a nice view, our table waiter saved the evening he was very attentive and very informative RE our dishes, but sadly again the drinks service let us down, of the 5 drinks we ordered 2 possibly or even 3 were watered down or had no spirit, our waiter agreed and immediately changed our drinks.", "date_of_review": "18 September 2014"}

Service: Table service girls inside are friendly and attentive, bar staff - not so much, beyond arrogant at times with quite a dollop of attitude. Not asking for curtsies and bow\u2019s but perhaps a smile, please, Thank you and a bit of general courtesy. Obviously a broad generalisation, but this is my general experience and the place\u2019s main downside. Staff who manage booking for food/ upstairs communication has always been flawless and helpful.

The interior is decked out in stylish schemes with barely identifiable decor and art work adorning the walls and suspended from the ceilings.  There were also a few dishes that were incredible - the belly of pork, the Wagu dumplings and the black cod - not to mention a very impressive choice of desserts.  Having said the above - and rating highly for the view, the venue and a few of the dishes (on just these it would be a straight 5 stars) I have lowered my overall mark because of the rest of my experience.  Firstly although we had reserved a table we ended up queuing, despite two burly men with ear pieces standing around pointlessly. Eventually when we cottoned on that some people were walking straight in we realised that the queue was not for those with reservations. Having traveled up the super fast lifts we then emerged into a reception area that was without any staff. We aimlessly stood for a moment until I hailed a passing person who I assumed (luckily correctly) worked for the restaurant - she pointed across the bar to another desk which was for the restaurant.  We enjoyed a drink at the bar before our allotted time slot for the restaurant. This is where you see how beautiful London can be - with the meandering Thames and the sheer size of the city stretching out in every direction.  We took our seats in the restaurant but had been assigned a table with slightly obscured views and with a door right behind me. My wife had specifically asked for a window seat with a view and although there were two empty tables perfectly fitting that description we were told they had been reserved by others.  My wife's first proper request to be moved was rejected - although we only found this out when, having waited 10 minutes for the person to find out whether we could move, we managed to get their attention and they then told us we couldn't move. They were apologetic - but seemingly unmotivated to encourage us to thoroughly enjoy our experience with them.  Eventually after 20 more minutes of being buffeted by the wind every time anyone used the door (and having had my eye on the resolutely empty tables with great views) I asked again whether we could move - however this time I asked someone wearing a jacket. This time we were re-seated. After this I had no more issues with the service and everything was what one would expect from a top-end restaurant.  I don't think I would want to come back here - I think it's probably just too cool for me - a place where the slightly disdainful looks from the staff are supposed to give the place an edge....", "date_of_review": "15 September 2014"}

After few minutes we sat at table and we ordered sushi, nigiri, rolls and a final dessert which was delicious (small icecreams with different flavours). The wine list is really good, but prices are quite high: we decided to go with 2 glasses of red wine each (medium price) and end our dinner with 2 espresso each. Final bill was: 70 BGP each, which is quite expensive. But Sushi was really the best one I ate in my life: tasty and smooth. The fish was fresh and vegetables as well.

We arrived mid afternoon, about 3.30pm. We went to the bar to order drinks first, and despite being the only guests at the bar the staff were far too busy chatting to each other and clearing up to even acknowledge our presence. They did come across as quite snooty, a little too pretentious. Eventually a young man decided to take our order but managed to be painfully slow, mainly because he was still chatting to his colleague. Drinks at last, we sat down to enjoy them, and the cocktails were very good. We were taken to our table and as one of our party had lived in Japan she was very comfortable ordering for us all. I don't think the waiter liked this as he tried to push several options on us but she was quite clear in what we should order. The food arrived and I have to say it was just delicious. No problems there. My overall opinion is that the food and drinks are great, but the staff are a bit 'up themselves' and it's quite expensive for what you get. I won't return because of the attitude of the staff. ", "date_of_review": "13 September 2014"}

I was already speechless and taken aback by the stunning views of London!  When you first enter you come face to face with the bar area which as you would expect for a city jaunt full of young professionals trying to impress each other and members of the opposite sex, bit loud but not annoyingly loud like other city bars, more a buzz lets say and a friendly atmosphere with massive trays of sushi floating back and forth like colourful flying saucers! We were led into the main dining room which was still office block like but given a few bent bamboo trees and concave lampshades the ambience was nice enough, don\u2019t have to try to hard when you have such great views (I like my views) in one of London\u2019s tallest buildings on a lovely summer\u2019s day with your special lady! Our waiter was very personable, not to pushy and wasn\u2019t trying to make us buy the most expensive items on the menu. Instead he kindly told us his favourites, how spicy we liked our food and just how much to order in order to taste a varied selection and insure our appetites were satisfied. He also promised to keep an eye on the football scores for me! Im really not a fan of Sushi, I much prefer a fine piece of steak or pizza to appease my appetite, I find sushi to delicate and somewhat confused at times. However entwined with great service I was pleasantly surprised and on this rare occasion enjoyed everything I put inside my lovely mouth! So as a food lover I recommend the green bean tempura to start (naughty but nice!), scallop temaki, lamp chops were amazing (worth paying extra for a 4th one!), TIGER MAKI (MUST HAVE!) and for pure greed EL TOPO, when is the next time you are going to have sushi with jalapenos and mozzarella!  I had previously dined at the Las Vegas restaurant and had a bad experience so to make it up to me, my girlfriend and I received complimentary glasses of champagne and our own personal dessert was which was immaculate and well appreciated! So as we watched the sun go down, bellies full of lovely morsels of food, sipping our champagne we both agreed this was one of our best dining experiences in London, and by far my favourite Sushi related restaurant in the world!", "date_of_review": "3 September 2014"}

They have a head waiter who comes round and is clearly good but the other staff look out of their depth. One person takes the order, someone else comes and says have you ordered? That's pretty poor.

A meal for myself and my wife mainly, and we took along our 3 and 5 yr old kids, \u00a3260 in total, which is not terribly expensive, but the trouble is that the meal wasn't worth the money at all.

The waiter was so friendly and helpful, talking to my boyfriend about the dishes in detail and recommending dishes. The food was amazing, we had lots of 'small plates' so we could try a lot. The black cod and pork belly were particularly nice. The head waiter came round and talked to us which was also really nice. We had the BEST view also and we couldn't get over it the whole meal. The atmosphere was great - busy, happy and we didn't feel out of place (we were a bit worried it might be a bit posh for us).

BEWARE the random \"dress-code\".", "comment": "I come to this venue very regularly, so I have the benefit, not just of one visit, but of frequent visits, so I personally qualify my review as being better informed than those of some one-time visitors with a one-time experience. Consider that somewhat arrogant statement as you might. I have however, never been for food apart from bar snacks (to which my food score applies). Only drinks. The good stuff... the venue is without doubt one of the best I've visited in my almost five years living in London. The view is no doubt the best I high-rise view I've been to in all of London. Forget The Shard (my review elsewhere), THIS is the best viewing deck in the city. I love the view from the window, I love the terrace, the firepit and the outdoor bar. I come here with friends, visitors to London, family and business associates and everyone loves it too! It's never too busy, especially at the weekends and although it is expensive, you're getting the venue as well as the drink, so I'm actually OK with that. The lift journey alone is worth the laugh! Makes me smile every time! ...and now, the not so good stuff... I can tell you that it is consistently my experience that the service at the bar here is always poor. It's slow and a little inept. If you order a cocktail, it seems to taste a bit different each time. I shrug and consider this to be totally forgivable... It really doesn't spoil the experience and if you stick to wine, it'll be quick and consistent. What DOES spoil the experience and in fact makes me very angry is that *sometimes* when you arrive, there's a power-trip bouncer on the door who says they have a \"dress-code\". I've been coming here for over a year and a half and I probably get admitted eight times out of ten. Now, I always dress smart-casual. I don't look shabby or unkempt and with it in mind that I've spent thousands of pounds here over that period of time and have brought others here in droves, I actually take powerful exception to being told on a Sunday afternoon \"sorry mate, not today... you need a better pair of shoes\" (genuine example). I asked if it was busy and he said no. I said I planned to buy a bottle of wine (what; about \u00a350? It's not nothing) and he still said no admittance. A couple of reasonably trashy-looking girls were let in straight behind us, who were not well dressed by anyone's assessment. There are any number of conceited elitist bars, policed by arrogant self-important bouncers in London that I can't get in to because I'm not a sexy woman and I don't know some guy who knows some guy and I do hope the proprietors of Sushisamba don't allow their fine establishment to become just another one of those. The city will lose something special if that happens. I guess a part of the problem there is that it is inconsistent. I have also been on a Friday evening when it's busy in a smart t-shirt with no quibble. So to sum up; would I recommend it?! Yes, absolutely! Great spot! Be patient with the service -it's worth the wait and I do hope when you visit, you won't get \"bounced\"! Enjoy the best views of the city with my recommendation!", "date_of_review": "25 August 2014"}

We went for my Dads 61st Birthday as a party of 7, I've been here a couple of times so I knew what to order.. Our first waiter was rude, pushy and extremely persistent in making us order so much more than we can actually eat which annoyed me from the start, he kept trying to get us to order foods that we don't even eat! Secondly, we ordered 3 portions of the Cod which is 6 skewers... the table was uneven and a drink spilled on the Cod... Before that happened my dad ate 1 of the 6 skewers and they replaced the rest of the 5 after the accident instead of bringing us a new dish... At the end when the bill came they charged us from not only the 3 portions we ordered but also the 2 other portions that the drinks dropped on (which was not our fault) I found that extremely cheap for such a prestigious restaurant! When I told them to change the bill they returned it with yet another stupid addition they charged us for the 3 portions of Cod as we ordered them and 1 skewer which we never ate! It was like they were trying to shame us to get us to pay, I've been to a number of high class restaurants around London, NYC and many more countries and this is the first time ever I've experienced such snobby behavior... Again they changed the bill after embarrassing us for the second time and we paid and left...

I was concerned as, of course, it is very \"hip\" at the moment and thought it may all be hype. How wrong was I? Our waiter was friendly and helpful. He guided us through the cocktail list, wine list and menu. We started with cocktails (watermelon baja, shiso fine and a nina fresa- all lovely) and tempura green beans. We then had Kuromitso pork belly (amazing), tempura prawns, yuzo scallops. Followed by the black cod skewers which were outstanding before our \"big plate\" of Churrasco Rio Grande (rib eye, wagyu and chorizo served sizzling on hot stones). Our eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs and we ordered a dessert each - Chocolate banana cake, banana mousse and red chocolate chilli peppers. All of these were creative and delicious but probably too rich given the amount we had eaten already. I really love the way the food comes out tapas style and it is all shared. Just as well, as it gives you the opportunity to try a range of dishes. I had banked on \u00a3100 a head and it actually came in at \u00a380 a head including service. Worth every penny!

Starting off with the outside terrace bar love the cocktails and the mixologists they are fantastic especially Pavel who always recognises me which is a nice touch. The views and cocktails from the terrace are great so it's highly recommended to get there a bit earlier and enjoy the view with a nice drink (on Fridays and Saturdays especially in the summer the terrace does get rather busy so bare that in mind). The food in my opinion is delicious however sometimes the flavours don't match the previous visits I recommend the yellow tail tacos they are amazing and the black cod is so delicious and half the price of any other top restaurant in London.

It feels like someone with tonnes of money and no taste has been let loose on an interior decor scheme which is actually very similar to the japanese-peruvian-brazilian cuisine, ie, high on ideas, but to be totally honest, kind of low on taste.  We Had the shrimp tempura (ok, but the sauce was a bit sweet), black cod, (ok but again kind of honeyed out of taste) and london sushi (kind of ok but ruined by a sweet sauce again). We also had the pork belly which was actually amazing so kudos for that. All in all, this could have been outstanding because of the view and the high end cuisine but is made as sickly sweet as the fake orange tree that hangs over the outdoor bar area by an overwhelming profusion of tastes and influences - sometimes simplicity is best.

However we had never ordered sushi before and we asked for advice, I explained I didn't like anything spicy. The waiter advised us to pick 5-7 dishes, we are only 19 and the place is expensive so we chose 5, because we didn't even know if we were going to like it! When we ordered, our waiter said that's not enough to order, you'll need to order a starter too. We felt quite pressured.. We didn't even want a starter! We were looking at the menu for ages because we struggled to find something we liked the look of! In the end the waiter said he had one in mind and he'll add that to our choices. We just went along with it, it was kinda loud so we couldn't really hear him plus his English wasn't great so he was hard to listen too! The starter came and it was the spiciest thing I'd ever tasted. Not impressed we paid for something we didn't want in the first place, especially after me saying I don't like anything spicy! The other dishes came out but we only ate the meat options as the rest of it just wasn't for us. The views are amazing and we'd come back for the bar but I wouldn't eat there again as I felt the staff were pushy and made us feel like we weren't allowed to eat there unless we spent over \u00a3100.", "date_of_review": "28 July 2014"}

I had been to Sushi Samba before in Miami, but my brother, sister, & Dad had never been, so it was exciting to experience this. Unfortunately, it had just stopped raining before we got there, so we were not able to sit outside. After taking the elevator to the 38th floor, you walk through the bar area to the hostess, and they take you through a hall to the restaurant. As you can see from pictures, the d\u00e9cor is simply beautiful!! We went right as the sun was setting so it was beautiful to watch it from the 38th floor and the waiters were all very attentive in moving around the room and lowering/raising the blinds so that the sun did not blind anyone.  Because this is a tapas style restaurant, we ordered a bunch of small plates to split amoung the four of us. Our favorites were the shrimp tempura, the wagyu gyoza, and the steak teriyaki skewers. The California rolls that we ordered were amazing as well! For dessert, we were pretty stuffed, so we ordered chocolate truffles for us to all share. Our server was very attentive, and we left very satisfied!! On our way out, we noticed that the terrace was open, so we went out there to take some pictures, and one of the waiters passing by offered to take a picture of us. Overall, it was an amazing experience, and I am so happy we had decided to go there! Definitely a restaurant to return to - especially with a view like that!!", "date_of_review": "15 July 2014"}

All going well until we got to Sushi Samba for cocktails at 4.30 to be turned away because we had 'flip flops' on. Readers please note, we were dressed well (long dresses not short), good jewellery, make up etc and the 'flip flops' that were deemed to be offensive were top of the range 'evening attire' Fit Flops - for those not in the know they don't come cheap. We had a friend with us from overseas who was very much looking forward to having cocktails looking over the London skyline, and so as not to upset what had up until that stage been a lovely day out, I 'questioned' their policy but did not take it any further as it appeared to be quite clear there were no exceptions. To add insult to injury, the next couple waiting to get in were in standard summer 'sightseeing' clothing and had what looked like cheap 'sandals' on which had far less foot coverage than our footwear, but because there was a small strap going round the back of the heel they were acceptable. I could even understand it if we were there later in the evening when people were dining, but it was 4.30pm for goodness sake. Oh, and had we arrived half an hour earlier we would have been let in!! Readers can make their own minds up about the rights or wrongs of this policy, but personally I believe this establishment needs to get over itself and enter the 21st century. We instead went to the 1901 bar at the 5 star Andaz hotel, which may not have the views, but is still a beautiful bar with welcoming staff who obviously were not 'embarrassed' by our attire.", "date_of_review": "14 July 2014"}

Sushi Samba is located on the 38th floor of the imposing Heron Tower on Bishopsgate in the City of London (right opposite Liverpool St Station). The entrance is a short, fast ride in the glass lift on the exterior of the building giving commanding views of the west end and beyond. On entering your nerves will be immediately settled by the lovely bar serving an eclectic range of cocktails through to a fine selection of wines. Once suitably refreshed you are led into the main dining room where all the tables have been carefully arranged to offer optimum comfort and viewing. The set up is over two floors with a second bar upstairs and a private area as well. The food is offered both 'a la carte' or as a legacy from their American roots 'family style' where a selection of signature dishes are brought out for you to experience and enjoy amongst friends. The style is Peruvian meet Brazil meet Japan and what results this combination brings to the table. From the sushi to the Chilean sea bass in a miso marinade with a multitude of delights in between you will not be disappointed.  They serve the most delectable lobster tostadas and the lightest tempura I have had in recent times. This place is set to stay and is consistent with their other global locations in both high quality service and ingredients used. The chefs creativity knows no bounds it seems. I have little doubt we will be seeing more of them soon. Meanwhile you can see more of me on Twitter @busy_dan", "date_of_review": "9 July 2014"}

The view (it's on the 38th floor) is spectacular - always ask for a table by the window or close to it. Booking may be a tedious process and they are often booked out so advisable to call with due notice (they do dinner tables until 1130pm on weekends and you can hold a table for three hours ). But the best slot to book is around 730pm in the summer when you see the sunset and earlier if it's winter.  Service - always courteous. The waiter's recommendations are spot on usually but they may try to rush you (not in a rude way).. I felt there was an emphasis on getting the order out of the way quickly . But hold your own and take your time with your food - they leave you alone once you indicate you don't want to rush ;) my advice is to order lots of small plates to share and not everything at once so you can eat at leisure . Portions are small so order several plates. Food - it's Japanese- Peruvian fusion cuisine (just lots of small plates of seafood and meats to share as well as veg options). Their food is not the best given the price tag but it's good. My recommendations are the fried calamari (which is well seasoned and yum), the stir fried prawns dish, the fried beans, and the tacos (if you like fish ). The jalape\u00f1o yellow tail sashimi is also nice, sushi is decent too. Black cod is excellent and in the big plate mushroom dish with plain rice is another favourite - ask for it without egg (that way they put more sauce in it and it's nicer). In desserts - rio - it's made of dark chocolate, milk chocolate and coffee is the best (even though I don't like dark chocolate it's a very nice flavour not too bitter) , also like the banana cake. The rest of it pretty average and the Peruvian chocolate with chilli sounds exotic but didn't meet my expectations. For vegetarians there is not too much choice but once you inform your server they go out of their way to create dishes for you. Avoid the sushi though as just didn't work in veg.   Dress code - smart casual. For lunch people are casually dressed (didn't see any shorts though) and gets a bit more dressy towards evening. Jeans and a shirt/smart top should do just fine although I make an extra effort every time I go. Price tag - Atleast 50pounds per head and could go up to around 80-100 depending on how much you drink. Directions - opposite Liverpool street station - 5 minute walk ", "date_of_review": "6 July 2014"}

Everything about this place is great. Our server Pablo was on hand and explained the food and its background, and suggested some very tasty dishes indeed, and our wine glass was never empty!  I was a little hesitant looking at the menu online as it looked rather complicated, but I needn't have been! I would suggest having lots of smaller dishes as opposed to one big dish, especially if you are in a large group, there's plenty to go around and it only takes 5-10 minutes if you wish to order another lot. (We ordered the pork belly dish three times!!) On top of the service and food there is obviously the view as you are 38 floors up... it's amazing! We went at 5 so was very light outside, but I can image when the sun goes down, or at night it will be even better! As for price, I personally think it's good value, but I am from London so used to paying it. It's on average \u00a313 a dish, which usually 4-6 people can share, and you'll need around 10 of them. For a table of 6 people, with a few bottles of wine and plenty of food, your looking at \u00a3300, so \u00a350 each - which I don't think is half bad!

Took 30 mins to get served mainly as there were lots of people having cocktails and the barmen couldn't cope. Things improved dramatically though when we got to the table. Our Polish waitress Karolina really looked after us and in fact dictated - in the nicest way - what we should have. Effectively lots of small dishes rather like Tapas but these were Brazilian and Japanese as far as I knew.

To say the lift was quick was an understatement, with people turning into miniature size ants within seconds. We had great seats, a beautiful panorama of London and it was irresistible not to take photos.  The waiters were incredibly attentive without being pushy or encroaching. The waiter we had was a charming man who recommended us to pick 5-6 smaller plates and dishes as it was our first time to get a broader feel of the food.  The food was as aforementioned a fusion between Brazilian and Japanese. The most breathtaking dish I had was the El Topo, which included salmon, coated in freshly melted mozzarella, and had Jalape\u00f1o in it. The shrimp tempura was also phenomenal and I would definitely recommend that to start with, creamy and extremely appetising. Every time the waiters and waitresses brought out the dishes, they explained carefully what was in the dish. Which was a nice touch, as I for one wasn't familiar with some of the ingredients in some of the dishes. And the staff were on hand to explain in a non-patronising, friendly manner.

Most people dress smartly, which is nice but it's relatively unpretentious so don't feel you have to necessarily dress 'up'. On the contrary you'll have a higher chance of 'drinks at the bar' when they are busy if you dress above the code. They can, and will refuse entry - whether full or not.  The service is nice in the restaurant and also the top bar (cocktails are more interesting here). The roof terrace bar service leaves a lot to be desired, particularly when busy. I've visited twice in the last month and drinks have taken a ridiculous amount of time/been wrong etc. It's off putting. Far from the best Sushi I've eaten in London - some might be a little disappointed given the price. The scallops were unimpressive, as were a few other dishes - I wasn't happy with the Wasabi type substitute (silly pet hate). The wagu beef, however, is worth is worth a try. On a more positive note we all loved the view, buzzy atmosphere, ambience and have had fun evenings here.

We arrived about an hour before our reservation and had a cocktail in the bar whilst enjoying the amazing view.  In a lot of cases having an amazing view quite often means the service and food are poor by comparison. Not the case here!! Our friendly waitress gave us some great recommendations on the food which took and were glad we did. A must is the Tuna taquitos which don't sound particularly Japanese but were so good they hit the top of my list of what we had. Another must is the tiger maki which were superbly presented and unbelievably tasty. Overall we ordered 5 dishes which was a perfect amount for two people and left us room for dessert which is not to be missed.", "date_of_review": "18 June 2014"}

First of all, I\u2019m a sushi junkie. I eat sushi at least 2-3 times per month and love sampling at different restaurants. I was completely underwhelmed by the food. I\u2019m not saying the food was terrible, but I\u2019ve had FAR FAR better sushi and given the d\u00e9cor and dining experience at Sushi Samba one would expect nothing but the best. At one point I asked for smoked salmon nigiri, one of my Go-To selections. I was told they only had regular salmon. I then asked for peppercorn tuna nigiri, one of my second Go-To selections. I was told they only had regular tuna. Huh? The restaurant brought us a variety of fusion options from the appetizer menu. Some of the items were really creative and interesting, but most of them were average at best. The pork belly was delicious.  This restaurant is ALL about the view. 38 floors up, the outdoor bar and patio area cannot be beat. A 270+ degree view of London from 38 floors up with a glass of wine in your hand is unbeatable. WOW. I did get the feeling this is a \u201cseen and be seen\u201d establishment for locals in London. At least that was my experience. Overall the scenic view, bar, and happy hour experience earned a solid A+. The food quality. Meh. I\u2019ll give it a D+ AT BEST.", "date_of_review": "17 June 2014"}

My summary is as follows. Amazing entrance, flying high over London in a glass lift that travels at the most incredible speed. The outside bar on a sunny evening is fab but the service was so slow.... I mean really slow. If they had had more staff I think their takings would increase by at least 25%. Cocktail bars need plenty of people serving as the drinks take so long to prepare. When we did get our drinks they were good and the views are amazing. So on to the food. Well if I am honest I didn't like the menu it was a bit confusing. We ended up going with the waiters advice. Everything was expensive as you would expect but you don't get much for your money. Service was patchy, very camp at times and a few of the staff were a bit grumpy. At this level of cost you expect nothing but the best.The actual restaurant has a wow factor going on but if you want a great food experience have drinks here and then go to Le Trois Garcon just up the road.

I would expect the staff to be aloof and a little chilly in a place like this but they're surprisingly nice and were more than happy to talk us through the menu which is a fusion of Japanese (sushi) and Brazilian (samba). This may sound dubious but I can assure you our food was delicious. The tastiest dish being the monkfish in butter. Yum.

Suffered the usual annoying \"Rain Man\" waiter (I always seem to get!) who didn't write any of my extensive order down (I assume to show off his memory skills) but then forgot an order and also two other requests we had. There was always some incredulous excuse as well for the delay which started to wear thin. In summary what Samba has done is take a lot of ingredients that people \"have always wanted to try but just a little bit of, in case they don't like it\". We had Foie Gras on Wagyu Beef Tataki (delicious) Turbot Sashimi (Chewy and massively overpowered by the truffle oil) and Black Cod skewers (delicious). The vegan dish of Daikon seemed to be more Japanese mushrooms than Daikon but A1 on presentation. I don't understand why it was named Daikon, they would get more orders if it was named a Mushroom dish! The Sushi was dreadful, and everything that poorly made fusion dishes are all about. Boring, skimping on the actual fish, and lacking any of the texture that good Nori and Sashimi have. The Wagyu beef on hot stones was a lovely gimmick and tasty too, though for 49 pounds I would have hoped so. Cocktails also were boring for what they were and the price charged. I spent 235 in total for two people - borderline three michelin star restaurant prices.

I asked for a Rob Roy (this isn\u2019t on the menu or considered a normal classic) and was fantastic. We were seated one table away from the window but still had a great view out over the city. We quickly had our orders taken where our food arrived shortly after. A wide range of choices are on offer which suited our varied range of tastes. Taking advantage of the tapas styled meals the first dish arrived quickly. Each was well presented and had great taste. Each time a new dish was presented the waiter was able to describe the dish and give hints of how to mix flavors depending on your tasting. We started with sushi and gyoza and ended with a Brazilian themed meat dish. Each time a plate was presented, the bar was raised. We made some quick changes to our order half way through the meal and this seemed no hassle to the staff. In terms of overall cost it is leaning towards the expensive side and for a table of 4 the bill just fell short of \u00a3200 (including drinks and service charge).

The first thing that strikes you is the decor -- very trendy, bright colours and pumping music. Our table wasn't ready so we had a drink at the bar. The Lychee Cooler is very nice, if a little sweet for my taste. We eventually got our table about 10 minutes late. Service was somewhat of a tag-team between two overly enthusiastic young waiters. Food was delicious, the Wagyu Gyoza was to die for, and the Moqueca Mista was a great sharing dish. After an hour and a half, they asked us for the table back.The bill included water which we hadn't ordered so they had to correct the bill, which took quite a long time. Overall, really nice food, great view, but they really do try to turnover the tables. Worth a visit on a special occasion as it's not cheap. The pumping music got somewhat tiring after an hour :)", "date_of_review": "28 May 2014"}

There is a bar area including some outside seating, the inside and outside bar areas were very busy when we were there for a pre-dinner drink, with people cruising around looking for a free spot to sit. When booking I had told them it was for a special occasion and if it was possible to have a window table. When we arrived we were shown to a table which was ok but not exactly a great window view - we asked about moving to another table that was by the window and was free but were told it was 'not available' - that free table sat empty for our entire meal - that's just bad service really! The restaurant area itself was light and airy although it had a cafeteria style about it rather than a swanky restaurant feel. The food itself was delicious and we ordered a selection of various dishes to sample. We tried the wagu beef that you cook on hot rocks which was good to do although in our opinion it was not worth the \u00a350 price tag. There was a reasonable selection of wines and cocktails although again all with a hefty price tag. Dinner for two with desert and drinks (and service) came to a whopping \u00a3280. We have eaten equally delicious food in other restaurants of similar cusine in London but where the final bill was much more reasonable. I guess you are paying a premium for the name & location here.

The views over London are staggering, the outside terraces provide a good opportunity to experience the weather, good or bad (this is London after all). Its no place for quiet conversation as people who book this place are making a statement. This is where money meets and talks, advertising types, rub shoulders with city bankers and brokers (many on expense accounts). Bamboo poles set up an eccentric style of east meets southern american. There's mood music in the background and louder music later (dj provided). Ok so I haven't mentioned the food. There is sushi and there is a south american slant to this. Never confused by menus this one stumped me so we had to ask the waiter what they sell most of. This provided 5 different solutions which were delicious, carefully presented as a piece of art. Mind you its an expensive art form there. Wine, to several hundred pounds reassures you of the pseudo exclusivity here. It is expensive but worth a visit for a special occasion. There are other restaurants which offer similar good food at better value but the view is worthy of some sort of premium. I'm just not sure of how much.

Some slight criticisms concern the wine list where our first choice Sauv Blanc wasn't available and the alternate Sauv Blanc was a much poorer taste. It was definitely a wine to have with food. Also in regards to the restrooms there are only two urinals and one cubicle for gents on the restaurant floor. With the numbers dining plus others at the bar this is inadequate as I had to queue on each occasion.  Overall the quality of the food and the views make this a must do dining experience in London.", "date_of_review": "4 May 2014"}

It was one of the better dining experiences. By the way - this is also one of those places \"to see and to be seen\", but even this middle aged business man was comfortable and happy there.

There is a bar upstairs which was closed off , which was strange considering the place was fairly empty....maybe it was just that it was monday. The restaurant is light and open and filled up fairly quickly, and has a good feel to it. The food was great, with the brazilian influence making a nice fit with the more traditional japanese food. However as with all things good, there is a price to pay. \u00a3700 for 4 is top end especially as we were mainly drinking beer, though maybe too many to be a cheap bill.

It was almost like a tapas restaurant - having a few dishes at a time and sharing. We had the tempura prawns and pork belly then the tuna in pomegranate juice, taco shells (not sure what was in them but very tasty) and the beef skewers. The flavours were fantastic and everything was cooked to perfection (unless raw of course!!) and presented beautifully. We finished with two different dessert dishes (both icecream based). All the dishes were small but nice to pick at. We also had two rounds of drinks (vodka and coke together with two bottles of lager).

Yes it is expensive, lunch last Wednesday set me back 144 GB pounds however it was quite possibly one of the most enjoyable and tastiest lunches I have had in London. This isn\u00b4t somewhere you go for a quick bite to eat on your lunch break, it\u00b4s a treat, an experience. Furthermore, I think people fail to understand that you are paying for the following:  - Incredible views overlooking London  - Excellent Food - Immaculate Service  - Strong alcoholic cocktails that are NOT watered down Of course it is going to be expensive! Anyways, moving on\u2026 Food was fab! We ordered around ten dishes in total, to name a few; we had the duck breast, beef fillet, coconut rice, the prawns, the samba rolls, the aubergine dish and we shared the banana cake in rum with vanilla ice-cream for dessert! The cocktails were tasty and very strong, just how we like them! All dishes were amazing, fresh and full on flavor. I really cannot fault any of them.  The service was very attentive, professional and it is so nice to see happy and SMILEY staff! Upon booking, I requested a table by the window which Sushi Samba fulfilled.  Honestly, it was such a lovely afternoon and they even remembered that it was my Boyfriend\u00b4s birthday (I told them upon booking the table a month in advance and they remembered!). Really exceptional service and we found the lunch was a nice treat before an afternoon at the Theatre.  My only advice would be, BOOK in advance. I booked exactly a month in advance and was only given the option of 11.30am for an early lunch or 10.30pm for a late dinner, I took the 11.30am and by the time we had cocktails and checked out the views, it was lunch time!

The food was nice (although the menu was very, very limited for gluten-free diners) - the hamachi kama was tasty, but slightly over-salted. The Samba London Roll was presented beautifully, but in terms of the content it was pretty average as far as sushi goes - the one stand-out element was the wagyu roll, it was different, and delicious! It was very over-priced for what you got (being London, you expect extortionate prices for a small amount of food, but I felt this was especially ridiculous: I had a normal size dinner slightly earlier than I ordinarily would at 4pm, before going to Sushi Samba and eating at around 6.30, and had to have a snack when I came home!). In particular, the only thing on the dessert menu that I could eat was a fruit salad, at the frankly shocking price of \u00a312! I politely declined. For a 'different' evening out, though, it certainly was somewhere to try once. The views from the restaurant were stunning, and I would be tempted to go back just for the excitement of the glass lift whizzing you up over London! Our waiters were lovely, very helpful and friendly, although you couldn't always hear what they were saying due to the background noise.

The service was faultless, and the sommelier steered us through an extensive sake menu before we settled on a beauty. But at \u00a350+ a bottle it should be.

It's always fun to skip lines, and when we walked to the velvet ropes and gave our names for the reservation, my wife and I were ushered into the glass elevator. Our table wasn't ready yet as we were early, so we enjoyed a quick cocktail at the upstairs bar. The hostess hunted us down in the crowd and escorted us and our drinks to a lovely intimate table next to the window with an amazing view of London.  The service was spectacular. I often find my fellow Americans have an opinion on service that simply doesn't apply to Europe as other reviewers of this restaurant seem to demonstrate. Compared to a lazy French bistro, Sushi Samba was downright speedy in terms of service. With fresh drinks in hand, we ordered a sampling of various items from the wonderful fusion menu. We asked that they bring items out as they were ready and not all at once, and they succeeding in keeping something tasty and interesting on our table for the entire evening. The food was marvellous. Each roll was something special and unique, challenging our palates. I must recommend the sticky ribs if you don't mind getting your hands dirty in a nice restaurant. We are already planning our next visit and are excited to try a completely different batch of items.", "date_of_review": "20 April 2014"}

All of this was only exceeded by the staff. Tareq and Andrea took care of us - Tareq is top notch and could work at any top hotel anywhere in the world. Genuinely helpful guiding us through the almost intimidating menu and recommending dishes which worked well together, as well as the best sake. He and everyone else were attentive yet unobtrusive.

He knew exactly what to suggest and how much we needed to order, we tried to order more and he suggested we wait until we had eaten all our dishes, which were all delicious. That was great advice as we couldn't have eaten any more! During our meal the restaurant manager, Remi, came to introduce himself and welcome us to the restaurant. He made us feel very welcome and nothing was too much trouble. Remi looked after us with his exceptional hospitality. At the end of the meal he insisted we had a dessert - which he then presented to us along with a 'Happy Anniversary' message.

I really like eating out and enjoy good food and good service. I do a lot of cooking, so always interested in the more creative combinations. Also, I appreciate it can be hard work for kitchens and staff to please a wide range of client\u00e8le. The pay for staff is not always great, and the work hard, so it is worth trying to overlook genuine mistakes (in a busy environment, these things can happen). However, at Sushi Samba it started badly and continued downhill. First, we were not welcomed, so didn't know where to go or who to see for our booking. Once found this out, we ordered a cocktail while waiting for our table and the barman had finger up his nose (!) while making the drinks (not ours), but even so... how disgusting!  After tentatively drinking the cocktails (which we now called boggie drinks), I asked bar waitress if our table was ready (as it was 10 minutes past out booking time) and was told to go get up and speak to staff other side of the room... Really!? So I did while she just hung around doing nothing! Toilets are not labelled clearly (it is a dark area with dark labels - genius!) and a male cleaner wondered in while my wife was in the bathroom (no knock, or excuse me...). She couldn't believe it. The food is poor, and I mean for the price, it is shocking. Sushi with chilli - that is basically it. Not exactly amazing. There are no timing issues, its just brought to you when it is ready - Wagamama style. The staff didn't know the restaurants provenance policy - but eventually we were told that the duck and chicken is battery cage produced! For these prices, that is really terrible! Flavours were very bland and we began to wonder if any of this is had actually been made on site, much almost tasting like supermarket ready-meals. The more adventurous dishes just didn't work. The staff had there own way of serving - which is really amateur. This is compared with many other established 'proper' restaurants who have a restaurant 'standard' of service. Professionals know how to 'read' customers and fit accordingly. Staff here seem to think they are a bit more part of the experience than they should be and like to impose this - there seems to be a habit of making stupid, cheesy comments which comes from an ill-fated attempt of trying to be informative and 'entertaining' at the same time. This becomes instantly irritating because it seems everyone wants to communicate like this. Save it for Nandos, However, important stuff like knowing the dishes, where food is sourced, explaining the menu etc. was missing. Describing a dish as 'yeah, that is my favourite, it really niiiice' is not good enough. One or two were just barging in the middle of our conversation (which was rude and not an attempt at being efficient), or kept asking if the food okay in that 'like I really care' manner. One turned away and walked off in the middle of our standard 'its nice thanks' reply!  The manner was basically similar to a cold-calling sales agent for personal injury claims, trying to be charming, but really just being instantly repellent. I got annoyed at one who kept banging the top of my chair with his hand when walking passed - every single time. Also, they insisted in barging through short-cut gaps between the tables, rather than just using the wider aisles. One lifting her leg near my shoulder so I had to lean forward.  By the end of our meal, we had passed to annoyed phase, and just found it funny and amazing this place really behaved the way it did. Even the music was grating and too loud. We asked for the service charge to be removed from the bill (it has been a long time since we've done that). The staff are dressed in black with orange ties, and this sum up Sushi Samba. It is all about trying to be trendy and 'now', but it is not a proper restaurant in my book. The appeal is the location and views, other than that, it has nothing but an hollow farce for the fickle to be seen; it is a cr\u00e8che for 20 to 30 somethings with too much money. The fast lift down was the most welcome end to the evening.", "date_of_review": "8 April 2014"}

Who just bites into a whole jalape\u00f1o by itself?) I love them in my food, but usually cut up. The staff was nice & food came fast, & the restaurant did have a nice atmosphere. I could see it being a good place to hang out on the weekend to have drinks.

Like Barbecoa - you don't go to Sushi Samba for any old reason. This place can be expensive. Stress on the word \"can\" because it doesn't have to be. Our booking for dinner was at 4.30pm - a little early you might think but it worked out to our advantage as we were taken great care of and served promptly and attentively. We had never been to Sushi Samba before. I had read mixed reviews about service so i was a bit apprehensive. We took the breath taking lift up all the way to the 39th floor and was greeted by front of house in the casual eating/bar area. The lady took our coats and we were lost after that as she didn't direct us where to go. No matter. We saw another lady behind a desk and approached her about our reservation (you must book for seated eating in the main restaurant. It gets fully booked very easily no matter what day of the week - even more so fri-sun). We were promptly shown to our table and given a menu. Our waiter explained the menu and made recommendations. We didn't order any of the large main course plates. We ordered a variety of the smaller tapas style dishes so as to get a taste of the different dishes. We told our waiter could he please tell/advise us if we were ordering too much and told us we ordered enough: yellow fin taquitos, poussin and beef robata, samba london sushi roll and tiger maki (see photos) Dessert was chocolate banana cake and yuzu tart cheesecake (recommended and amazing!) We ordered dessert wine to go with the dessert. When the waitress arrived and asked us who ordered which wine - I had a freak out because I couldn't remember and she simply asked who had ordered what dessert and gave the right wine to each of us. Excellent knowledge of the menu and accompaniments! Very impressed. Overall very happy with the treatment by the staff. We were well looked after and made to feel welcome.

No more so have I ever felt this than at your restaurant. We ate at your sushi bar and we have never felt so unwelcome in any restaurant.

That, coupled with a brilliant greeting from our waiter Jacob made for a great first impression. ...and the evening simply continued in the same fashion. Jacob was helpful, attentive and incredibly knowledgable about everything in the menu(s), to the point that we went almost solely on his recommendations, for both food and drinks. The food was stunning; quite unlike anything I've had before, a mixture of flavours I'd never have expected to enjoy quite so much, and the cocktails were spot on. This is the kind of meal that I see almost as an investment. The bill would have made me yelp under any other circumstances, but given the fact that this was indeed one of the best restaurant experiences I have ever had (and possibly ever WILL have), money simply didn't seem to be an issue.

A recorded message told us that the line was open from 10am on Sundays but it then repeatedly just rang and rang until it cut off. I finally got my call answers on my 14th attempt at calling, some 40 minutes after I first tried. By now it was 12:10. I explained that we had been delayed and that we would be at the restaurant at 12:20. The man I spoke to said that the table would be cancelled automatically at 12:15. I asked if this could be extended as we were on our way and I promised that we would still vacate the table by 2:30, as we had been given a 2.5 hour table time. The man said that he was in a call centre and couldn't do anything more to help, the table would therefore be cancelled at 12:15 if we hasn't arrived by then. He then suggested that we turn up at the restaurant and 'ask really nicely' if they would still accommodate us, although he couldn't promise that we wouldn't be turned away. I didn't fancy having to spend my daughter's 18th birthday grovelling so we didn't bother going at all - the chance of being turned away at the door just wasn't worth it. I see no reason why they couldn't have kept the table given the lengths I went to to advise them we were en route.

We had ordered half a dozen dishes between us which probably enough but everything was absolutely delicious so ordered another couple. Highlights for us were to miso glazed ribs off the robata grill, some grilled flank with amazing giant corn kernels, the tuna seviche and really good samba rolls. Service slick and speedy. Only one negative thought the cocktails lacked a bit of strength and tasted a little too much of the fruits included within them. 2 cocktails, 4 glasses of wine and 8 courses for \u00a3185.

The highlight was the wagyu beef on hot stones which we both loved (although it is expensive for what it is) we also had various other dishes and sushi.

We went on a cold winters night and I can only imagine that seeing a summer's sunset here is even better.  However moving on to the the food, while the tast perhaps justifies the price, the disappointing portion size certainly does not. I would certainly recommend not coming here hungry unless you are really willing to spend a small fortune. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, but more so for the novelty of the view and the decor than for the food itself. Unfortunately I think the restaurent trades on the hype surrounding it rather than than on its product, and there isn't anyone that believes it more than the waiters themselves, who will describe at great lengths the brilliance of a certain dish, which will taste great for a single mouthful but ultimately leave you rather disappointed. I would certainly recommend it as an experience, but reccomend stopping for an Itsu takeaway box on the way home to fulfill ones appetite.", "date_of_review": "17 February 2014"}

There was a mix up with the dates of our reservation and for some reason, we had booked the week after when we actually wanted to go (miscommunication on the phone and i didn't recheck the email booking). Luckily, there was a table available for us. They guided us to our table and the lovely man pulled my chair out for me. The waiter was so attentive in that he started with drinks and they came so fast and then explained the menu to us as it was our first visit. We struggled to hear him and understand his accent but we managed to get the gist. He gave us 5-10 minutes to study the menu and then came back to take our order, we had no idea what to order (portion sizes etc) and he made some suggestions and we just left it all up to him to sort it out for us and boy, he made good choices. We started with tacos (yellowish and a sort of vegetarian option), then had the rock shrimp (so delicious i could have eaten a whole bucket of them!), then we had some raw fish and some beef, then sushi rolls with seafood in and wasabi mayo (they were so nice, and full of flavour and made you want to eat more to see what else you could taste!), then after that we had something else that i can't remember....i think i was full and just overwhelmed at this point! The other good thing was that the waiter (one of many!!!) explained everything in detail before we ate each course. they couldn't have been more attentive and were on hand at ANY point. The bill was just over \u00a3100 and we had a beer and a bottle of water which I don't think is unreasonable given the service (which was a discretionary 12.5% and included in my aforementioned bill price), the view (which was exceptional!!!), the food and the overall experience and wow factor.

I called in the week to confirm that their door policy was still the same- that if you are arriving for drinks that you do not need to book, and that as a male in my mid-thirties with two friends that we would not have any issues with the door staff. Whilst the person I spoke to in the week was very helpful and said that we would be able to arrive without booking, and that 3 males in their thirties would be more than welcome, unfortunately this was not the case. Immediately when we joined the queue the smaller doorman in a woolly hat immediately took dislike to us and pointed to us and then spoke to his colleague. It took 20 minutes for us to get to the front which in itself isn\u2019t a problem, and we were then held at the rope for an additional 10 minutes. The taller of the two doormen engaged us in conversation, and asked the same old Sushi Samba question when they are trying to get rid of you- \u201cHave you had any other drinks tonight?\u201d. We had actually been out for dinner prior to arriving at Sushi Samba so responded honestly- we had consumed ONE glass of red wine each. ONE! In his opinion this was too much and we got told to clear off.  If we were drunk I would have understood. If we were dressed inappropriately I would have understood. If he had told us the minute we joined the queue that he had no intention of letting us in I would not be as annoyed as I am. He kept us waiting there for 30 minutes in the cold and completely wasted our time. This is not a one off occurrence. Read through the some of the other reviews left on here and you will find many left by people of the same demographic as myself who experienced the same treatment. Prior to Christmas the smaller of the two door staff (let\u2019s call him Mr Hat, as on both occasions was wearing his woolly head-wear) treated me with similar disregard. He accused me of jumping the queue and it was only with the backing of a group of strangers behind me who confirmed that this was not the case that he finally let me in. The arrogance of the two guys on the door has left me dumbfounded. It is not what I expect from such an establishment. I would suggest that Sushi Samba need to invest in some training for these two people, or perhaps replace them with individuals who would represent their brand more appropriately. If you are set on paying them a visit perhaps bring a breathalyser with you so that you can prove you haven\u2019t had anything to drink, at least they will have to think of another excuse to turn you away.

We stayed on for drinks in the bar after and felt it was fairly priced for the venue and city location but not somewhere we would eat often. Would recommend for family meal (our children are young adults) or celebration outing if you want a treat or are trying to impress visitors.

The service was very good and the staff were always helpful to explain things. The dishes are small but I prefer this as you are able to try more of the different food categories. I would recommend the Rock Shrimp, It was absolutely delicious, and the Cheesecake.", "date_of_review": "31 January 2014"}

Getting a reservation is very difficult so book well in advance. The staff were lovely and helpful guiding us through the menu and we even managed to have a few laughs with them too which is nice as sometimes waiters can be quite robotic doing what they need to do without really engaging with their diners. The food was exceptional we ordered between 1-2 dishes from each section which was advised so that we could try a little of everything.  With wine, cocktails, food an dessert we paid \u00a390 each (between 3) which yes to some is expensive but it was expected and the food was great so I didn't resent paying.

First of all the wait for our table - there was none, we were invited straight in to the main dining area (after a breathtaking elevator ride to the top of Heron tower - 30 plus floors) though we could have ordered drinks and paused briefly in the bar if we wished. Outstanding views across London can be had almost anywhere - the restaurant has huge glass windows and is not huge - and all the bar areas look out across London - you can literally peer down onto The Gherkin and St Pauls. There's an outdoor patio balcony as well which is breathtaking. Service throughout is impeccable as you'd expect, and there is a formidable drinks menu. Food choices are less exhaustive , with around 20-30 items. It's also fairly eclectic so be prepared for that. I chose a \u00a350 steak, which came on its own with several dipping sauces - and it was superb - though the food may not tick everyone's boxes.

It's based in a pretty awesome location, the 38th floor of the Heron Tower. On arriving, you can see the lifts whizzing up and down. The lift up is breathtaking. We were greeted by a friendly lady who showed us to the reception area and then we were introduced to another lady who showed us to our table. Luckily we had pretty amazing seats at the front of the restaurant, by the window so it made me pretty happy to have such a good table. Another 3 staff attended to us over the course of the meal, all were incredibly polite, attentive, friendly and really knowledgable on the menu and what Sushi Samba represents and a little bit of restaurant background. This was all nicely welcomed. We ordered cocktails which were really tasty. So tasty we had 3 each. We were helped with the menu and given some recommendations, some we went with, some we didn't. Prawn Tempura was incredible. Pardon Peppers and Edamame were lovely too, but you can't go wrong really there. Loads of Edamame but perhaps more of the peppers. Tuna Nigiri was melt in the mouth delicious. Strawberry Maki was the highlight, really delicious. Samba London rolls also really really good. The main meal was so lovely and plentiful too, just stunning. Even though we were full, we really wanted to try out the desserts and they looked really interesting. This is what was a slight letdown. Tasty, but just nowhere near as good as the sushi dishes. The deconstructed cheese cake was really lovely, looked amazing on the plate, but was just a but meh. The chocolate chilli mouse, I found to be bland. The only thing that was really nice was the sorbet that came with it. It was not horrible by any means, just compared to everything else was a slight disappointment and what prevents this from being a 5 star review. The only other thing to mention was the toilets were a bit rank! For a fancy restaurant with a stunning setting, incredible food and lovely attentive staff, was a little surprised to find quite a shabby and slightly dirty bathroom. The bill was nearly 200 pounds. So, really quite pricey for two people, however, this was expected and we did have a lot of food and 70 odd was on drinks alone, but as long as you know it's fairly pricey, then it shouldn't be too shocking!

The setting is superb and, yes, you are in the middle of London so don't expect a bargain. Service was a delight from beginning to end (friendly and informative) with my only quibble being the usual mix of heavily accented staff which can make dish descriptions difficult to pick up against any background noise. The food is terrific. Visually stunning and with subtle flavour variations. The duck robata and Sao Paulo samba rolls were particularly good. Make sure you have desert, 'With love from Rio' is a great example of the fusion ideas at the heart of their dishes. If I'm picky, the tables were a bit too close, you shouldnt have to struggle to get up without disturbing fellow eaters. The price is high but largely justified, we spent \u00a3130 as a couple including alcoholic drinks and ate plenty.", "date_of_review": "31 December 2013"}

The view is only good if you sit outside or next to a window, but if the weather is bad, you cannot see anything from the window.  I would recommend to instead go only to the bar, as dining is not at appropriate level. In the bar there is a limit access to a clear window with a great view.

In the restaurant, nice welcome and great service by all the staff - nothing better than a smiling waiter who knows the menu and ingredients used.

Our waiter (Andrea) helped us in the choice of what was worth trying, and any of the dish that arrived on the table was worth the visit. He even brought us a little improvised birthday cake complete with a candle for my fiancee at the end of the meal, which was a very nice touch! Needless to say, an unforgettable experience has its price tag, which was relatively hefty (but we ate a lot, and had 2 glasses of champagne on top). All in all though, definitely worth trying!

This is where the experience started - What a lift!!!! (yep, you can tell I'm a northerner!!) It was smooth and swift and the views were fabulous - we knew that this was going to be a great last late night drink. On arriving into the bar area of Sushi Samba we were delighted by the funky music, modern decoration and stunning glass panelling allowing all customers to see the views at any time - definitely had the \"something special\" vibe. Instead of treating ourselves to a cocktail (VERY pricey) we all had a japenese bottled beer - delicious and a reasonable price too, and took ourselves outside onto the spacious and sparkly roof terrace. This was the most comfortable area of the bar - a lot of space and seating, plus heaters, a fire pit and a huge magical tree lit up in a thousand orange glowing lights, stunning!!!!

They removed my cocktail from the table when I went to the loo (there was still 1/3 left) and I complained to the waiter who promptly ordered a new cocktail and did not charge for it.  We were advised to order a few dishes from the menu since the principle is to share your food.  The Gyoza were the best Gyoza I have ever had! (I am a japanese food fanatic).

We had no reservation, had no idea about the hype of this restaurant and therefore did not know what to expect. (Did I wish I had read some reviews before) On the ground floor we were told by a girl at the door that it was not busy in the restaurant so we were very likely to get a table, we just had to speak to the receptionist. We went up the magical lifts (that really is a once in a life time experience and reminds me of Charlie in the chocolate factory when he flies through the roof with Mr. Wonka) to find ourselfs a few seconds later in the restaurant. The lady at the cloakroom seemed lost and handed us over to the receptionist who informed us it was really busy and we could not have a table. (Communication?!)  Since we were not too fussed, we were happy to sit down in the bar area to have some drinks and then later see if a table was available. The waiter that served is was correct but very pushy with his sales. Everything that came out of his mouth sounded forced and not genuine. What confused the tree of us more was the accent (same for the receptionist). The three of us are not natives but speak good English ourselves and all of us work in hospitality. The way the menu is set up is very confusing. A couple next to us had a fantastic platter of sushi that we wanted to have as well. When asking the waiter for advice, the menu beame even more of a mistery! And when our plate arrived it looked nothing like the plate of the couple next to us!!  With the sushi you have no idea how many pieces you receive for the price stated. We had to ask another waiter to make things more clear to us (hoping for someone with better English) which seemed to annoy our personal waiter and that showed in his service. A second bottle of wine was served and never finished at the table, we all noticed and asked the waiter to which his reply was \"no, the bottle is not in the ice bucket anymore so I have finished it\" we all noticed there was a bit left and commented on it but the waiter did not know how to deal with this. We were wrong and he was right. We didn't want to make a fuss so we just asked for the bill without the service charge as we all felt the service was very poor. The waiter rolled his eyes and sent a manager to our table. We explained the situation and were offered a glass of prosecco which yes is a nice gesture but does not make up for the service and the experience of the night. In a nutshell, the food was good, the desserts were amazing but the service and the price are not worth going there. Even if you have no expectations, the least you want is friendly service and the feeling that you're welcome and that was not the case. If I want to go back for the views, (which of course are stunning!!) I'll make a reservation at duck and waffle or go for cocktails at the Shard.

We were seated fairly quickly and our waiter tended to our table but I have to say, it was a little overdone. I felt like we were interrupted every time we started a conversation (our waiter was over zealous) and I think that showing us the still water we ordered as though it were an expensive bottle of wine was one tedious step too far. There is such a thing as overdoing customer service and I think we found it here at Sushi Samba. In terms of the food - well, it was okay. But it was not the best I have ever eaten so I do not think it deserves the hefty price tag it comes with. It was a rather expensive light meal and I left feeling hungry and unsatisfied but lighter in the wallet. There is nothing at all worth raving about at Sushi Samba but it is not terrible either. It is one of those places that promises more than it delivers and there are far finer dining establishments in London.

There you have it. A mixed experience.

All I can say is that we had a wonderful time. We were told on arrival that the table was ours for the next 3 hours. So went and had cocktails which we took to the outside bar until we got a bit cold, then went to the bar upstairs. The cocktails really are very good. Then went to the table. Our waiter was Owen, from Manilla. He was very knowledgeable and guided us through the menu very expertly. He looked after us wonderfully for the evening. The sake sommelier gave us equally excellent advice. I have been trying to recall exactly what everyone had, but no-one can quite remember!!! So I think our message would be - take the waiter's advice!!! Because each dish was spectacular. We recall having had: Padron peppers and Green bean tempura to start while we looked at the menu. Both were different and very delicious. To start, the four of us shared Rock Shrimp, Pork Belly, Tuna and Chicharron - each of which were absolutely delicious also. The seabass in miso was as spectacular as the Nobu black cod, and the flank steak, and duck breast equally as amazing. We then had Samba London and Sao Paulo rolls which were mind blowing!!! To drink we had sake, chosen by the sommelier which was wonderful and a condrieu, chosen by by me, which, to be honest, wasn't the greatest condrieu I've drunk. Not awful but just not great. We had four different desserts, each of which were beautifully presented and delicious to eat. Forgot to mention the ambience - amazing venue!! There's a bar out side with great views; a bar upstairs if you get cold and a bar in between. The staff were great. So, in summary, everything was five star.

Where this place fell down for me was the food and drinks. Don't get me wrong, nothing was really bad, but little was amazing either. I remember being enthralled by this restaurant chain in the USA more because of the food and drinks than the surroundings and it seems the UK version did the opposite for me - great view and nice fit out. This is a great tourist destination, but if I lived in London I wouldn't be returning over and over. Perhaps we didn't choose widely enough, but the south American influence on the food was lacking. The lobster was not worth the money and showed little effort or imagination next to other dishes. The Sasa hand roll was inspired, as are the mochi. Other dishes ok.

The restaurant itself has good views of the city - since the Cheesegrater was built you can no longer see the shard, however the views are pleasant enough. The restaurant is welcoming, and our waiter made us feel welcome and helped us interpret the menu, which is a little different to most, being that the dishes are intended for sharing. This brings me to my next point; the sharing plates are in the \u00a310 - \u00a315 range (some are more) in the main, and for that you will get one item of food - we had 5 people at our table and we ordered 18 plates, and I didn't leave feeling bloated by any means...

The waiter talked us through the menu and recommended how to order - essentially, each dish is designed to share - working your way through various different styles of food. Japanese / Brazilian / Peruvian styles, influences and fusions - each dish so so tasty and very presented. Difficult to recommend one single dish as all were as good as each other. The memorable meal was finished off with a personal 'Happy Birthday' message written on the dessert we shared. The restaurant decor is great and as you would expect, with all but one wall fully glazed. Service could not be faulted (and 12.5% service charge added to bill easily justified). The cocktails were on a par with the food, and there is a separate bar outside of the restaurant area where you can visit and admire the view over London.

The restaurant is reached via a super fast glass lift that runs up the outside of the building and affords fabulous views across the city. Ok so it's not as high as the Shard, but then you're not paying \u00a325 for the privilege either. The view from the restaurant and outside on the terrace is similarly spectacular - albeit it was cold and wet the night we visited. The bar upstairs was pretty funky too.  We visited this restaurant in early November as a party of 10 people. As is often the way we were asked to pre-order, and slightly disappointingly could only choose from the set menus. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant so could not enjoy the views as well as some others. The quality of the food was generally excellent. The beef in particular was fabulous. Service was slick, friendly and entirely appropriate. Top marks to the guys and girls who waited on us.  The one big problem was the quantity of food. More than one of our party complained of being hungry afterwards. When you're spending \u00a3200 a head I don't think that this is on. Clearly SS is an \"occasion\" restaurant for most people, and you shouldn't leave feeling that you haven't been fed properly! I toyed with the idea of rating Sushi Samba 3 blobs (average) but think that this would be very harsh bearing in mind the quality of food. Perhaps a fairer reflection is that I would probably go back.

The glass lift shaft launches you into the London skyline with breathtaking speed barely allowing you to take in the magnificent views Westwards.  The venue is clearly very much in demand. We walked through the bar to get to the restaurant and it became obvious to us that the bar and restaurant were packed (there was also a long queue of people waiting outside in the cold for tables outside the ground floor entrance). There is no doubting how glamorous the location is (which had the air of an upmarket nightclub about it) and clearly this allure has brought a very eclectic crowd to the Liverpool Street area - as opposed to the usual corporate types. The food itself was good - some of the dishes were indeed very tasty though others were hit and miss. I don't, however, think I would go back just for the food and, as one might expect the prices are sky high. A meal for two with a modest bottle of Spanish Viognier and a couple of glasses of sake came to just shy of \u00a3200.

He even made the boys stand outside (he probably thought they were not dressed properly given they were wearing tracksuit bottoms and jeans, but they had just been hauling boxes). My husband and I however asked to go upstairs to \"take a look\". I headed straight to the reception desk and asked for a table for 6. The lady at reception found us one!!!! I know she made an effort to do this and we were very grateful she did. We were then led to our table by the immensely friendly, courteous and charming Remy. Little did I know that we were not only given a table but the BEST table in the house with spectacular views!!!! Our waiter was extremely polite, helpful and knowledgeable. each one of his recommendations were spot on and we had an absolutely amazing lunch and fabulous Saki.  Remy checked in on us frequently and not once was a glass left empty. This is how attentive they all were. Remy then personally saw us out, gave us his card and asked us to return with a genuine welcome. This we will indeed do - no question. Rarely does one get such fantastic service, food and views and I have two morals of this story - \"Never take no for an answer\" - otherwise we would have gone home if we had listened to the guy at the entrance.

After stepping out of the rollercoaster of the lift with popped ears we were greeted by an empty terrace and quite a few staff milling around but not really pointing us in the direction of the table. However all this was swiftly changed when we stepped into the restaurant and got a table next to the window overlooking Shoreditch and beyond. It was buzzing at 2.15pm right through until we left at 5.30pm.  After staring in slight bewilderment at the menu the young waiter stepped up to the mark and offered to order for us, after asking us what we did and didn't like. Despite having mixed tastes this really worked well. The highlights to me where the Chilean sea bass cubes,which melted in the mouth with a deliciously creamy taste, and the fresh and diverse mound of sashimi. Everything was excellent.  I got slightly worried about the bill when the courses didn't stop coming but we were tempted by the desserts. Thankfully we ordered 2 between 3 as they were massive and very tasty.  Cocktails are different and almost taste healthy with a balanced amount of alcohol, which helps keep you on an even keel when the lunch goes on for a fair while. Another of the increasing number and diverse views of the London townscape. Only slight gripe was the wine waiter who just tried the sell us the most expensive bottle of wine regardless of our taste.  It is expensive but its worth it for special occasions and maybe I should be giving it 5 stars.", "date_of_review": "3 November 2013"}

Cocktails and the saki list seemed to go on forever, so we did need a bit of help choosing, but everything was delicious! Was full of tourists and City parties, but a good mix. There are tables outside on the balcony, although not sure it would be warm enough to sit out in the winter. There are heaters, so take a coffee outside and enjoy the wonderful views! The bar at Sushi Samba is very busy - been to the bar a few times and, to be honest, the service is exceptionally slow, so be patient! Fridays and Saturdays at Sushi Samba are crazy busy, so I'd avoid those like the plague, if possible. Monday night was a great night to go, although they do close the upper level bar at Sushi Samba, which is very pretty. The outside area, with the fabulous trip, which lights up the sky is fun.

Remi started by bringing us a glass of champers each (which was on the house). We now had a new waitress (Valerie), who was just as lovely and proceeded to explain the menu to us. We decided to go one dish at a time, for which Val was extremely knowledgable and was happy to give us her personal recommendations, we gladly followed and were not disappointed.  Throughout our evening we were well looked after with a waiter only ever a couple of steps away ready to help.

The place is really nice but for me the food, although a bit pricey, makes all the difference. The atmosphere is a little too cool for my liking: I mean the type of place where people go to see and been seen rather then a nice chill out restaurant and the fact that a member of the security staff was trying to stop us taking a picture on the terrace, after we had dinner, added to the feeling. However once you forget about the 'uber cool' surrounding and sit down for dinner, the mixture of taste and texture of south american and Japanese dishes is amazing.

At the street level entrance, visitors are checked if they comply with the dress code, and a couple in from of us were not let in as they wore trainers.  With no annoying security checks, we were shown to the lift which shuttled us to the 40th floor. The lift runs through a glass structure at the outside of the building, allowing for panoramic views toward the West.  Upon arrival it is best to head downstairs for the Samba Sushi area, past the orange themed walls, covered with feathers and glitzy chandeliers and a great look onto the gherkin and the cheesegrater. There is a bar \u201cdownstairs\u201d, i.e on the 38th floor and there is an outside space with a giant orange trees, barkeepers dressed in orange outdoor jackets to defy the polar temperatures up here /out here. The drinks available outside are just champagne, one rose, two white and two reds. All wines are around \u00a38 per small glass, and the red was far too cold, but honestly, we were not bothered. You come here for the atmosphere, and the views and what we now call \u201cexperience\u201d. It is clearly a touristy place (including those from Essex), and is all about showing off.

This time my wife and I were celebrating our anniversary, she was grinning from ear to ear and we had only been in the lift! Having read some of the negative reviews on this site, all I can say to you guys is let your hair down, live a little and enjoy the ride of sushi samba! We arrived and were sat at a small table near the entrance to the restaurant. This was disappointing to say the least. Lucky enough I was recognised by the maitre d and whisked off to an amazing table by the window with the most spectacular views of London. Cue instant brownie points scored for me. On previous occasions the food has been good, but a little hit and miss. This time we decided to leave it to our excellent waiter, Edwin from Lithuania and it didn't disappoint at all, in fact it was truly memorable. All in all a superb evening. Thank you sushi samba.

Yes the setting is nice, more so when the balcony is open. However if you leave your customers hanging at the bar for over 30mins without even an acknowledgement then it doesn't matter how nice the view is, you'll be so bored and frustrated that you'll move on. I have been twice and whilst the first time I put down to a busyish Friday night, I went recently on a Saturday afternoon and found the service was even slower despite 3 men behind the bar and a queue not even one deep. The problem?One painfully slow drink made at a time. Lack of queue management, e.g. the poor guy next to me was already waiting when I turned up and all he wanted was 4 bottles of beer!; failure to know which section of the bar they were serving, failure to work down the line.

Yes, the venue is nice and the views are good. The cocktails were lovely too, however for \u00a314 a drink I would expect them to be. What was ridiculous was the 12.5% service charge they add to your bill!!! What the hell for? There was no table service and the bartenders were not exactly friendly! I thought that was ridiculous.

The decor is very contemporary and really well done.  The bars has great cocktails: tasty and beautiful. The crowd averages from mid-30s to late-40s, which made us feel right at home. The food is fabulous. Just as the name suggests; japanese/south-american fusion. The sushi is delicious, however that should not be the reason for going there as the other dishes are truly spectacular. The chilean sea-bass is most definitely a must. Service is good. Our waiter was helpful, pleasant and full of suggestions. However, it was very busy and they did forget to bring one dish and we had to order a bottle of water a couple times before it finally made its way to our table. Great selection of Saki including a delicious sparkling version. The only downside (hence 4 stars as opposed to 5) is the music at the dining area which is definitely way too loud for conversation.  Reservations are required and they offer some very strange hours such as 4pm or 2am. We had to wait almost months for a 10:30pm slot.

The restaurant itself is also impressive a glass atrium with views for miles on two sides (not all sides though), but it will depend greatly on where you sit as to whether the impressive view will be your meal companion. We were luckily to be seated by the window with a breathtaking view of London. I really wanted to give this restaurant a better rating and the reason I haven't is purely because our charming waiter explained the concept of small plates based on sharing and suggested we had at least one from each section. Needless to say neither the concept was foreign, or was my surprise that a plate from each section was unnecessary when we only ordered four dishes and it was plently of food for two. We were told that they brought everything when it was cooked. However, we were also told that dishes followed through the sections and I thought they would follow in stages.  We had been sitting for not quite 15 minutes since entering the building enjoying some edamame beans, which were supposed to be the prelude to a great meal when everything arrived together. This meant by the time we reached the half lobster, whilst was delicious it was a tad cold and it was all a bit overwhelming. I slightly feared the whole experience would be done in half an hour. The staff are attentive, but almost to the point of annoying with the constant water topping up and desperation to whisk dishes away before they were finished. There is a definite desire to up-sell, although it is done politely. As we were paying a table behind us had just sat down and these two gentlemen were told exactly the opposite and asked how and when they would like their courses. Was this because they ordered the wagyu at about \u00a350? Same waiter different story. As my guest for lunch had loved it and I genuinely enjoyed the food and the view despite everything arriving together, I did not see any reason for a fuss, but they need to sort this out.  The food itself was good. The sashimi combination was full of interesting flavours, but \u00a321 for three of thinnest slices of fish I have ever seen is a bit of joke even by London standards. The tuna was in a great sauce, but I actually struggled to identify it as tuna and having eaten some truly delicious tuna in California recently this was a real let down. I would suggest you go for the grilled or other items which were decent sized portions for sharing plates and the tempura prawns were excellent. Would I go again? Despite the moan, this restaurant has an amazing view and decent food for which you are being overcharged for the view. There are loads of places like this around the world and its not to say that you will not enjoy it, but its worth remembering to ask that they bring your dishes in stages so that you can enjoy the view that little bit longer.", "date_of_review": "5 October 2013"}

We had visited Sushi Samba in Las Vegas, and this branch is just as good. The menu could be a little confusing, but our waiter pointed us in the right direction, and his suggested number of (sharing) dishes was just about spot on. We were full, but not bloated at the end of the meal. The food itself is a mix of sushi (obviously), sashimi, small sharing plates and also large main courses, but all are meant to be shared by the table. Particularly good, were the rock shrimp tempura, glazed pork belly wraps and sea bass tempura. Our sashimi seviche was interesting, although i'm not sure I would have it again - nice to try something new though. Dessert was fabulous - a yuzu tart cheesecake, with dinky little sugar sphere over the top - superb! One small point (if I could have knocked half a point off, I would have done).

The loos are funkier than the restaurant, which is a little spartan rather than minimalist. This is posh prices and posh views without posh comfort, I suspect it looks better at night. The bar is one of the most uninviting I have ever had a drink in. That said the staff were terrific, they held our table and let us run over, the food was excellent; a little precious if you are hungry but superb flavours. The beef 'cook your own dinner' show is mildly amusing but over-priced so I recommend picking dishes that involve the skills of the cooks. Compared to the Las Vegas Sushisamba the food is not as exciting and the atmoshere rather muted, but at least you can speak to each other.", "date_of_review": "27 September 2013"}

The food is better than average but in no way either justifies the price tag or the setting.

Views are unparalleled in London (haven't been up the Shard yet though) and the experience is well worth one visit. I would suggest going for a drink but save your money for a better restaurant - can't fault the staff though. In the face of some very \"demanding\" customers they were exceptionally professional and charming. Who likes this place? Bankers and footballers and anyone with a head for heights. The glass lifts that make you feel like you are flying are extraordinary.

The music was very loud which is fine but it ruined the atmosphere a little. The terrace bar outside is quite small and areas were sectioned off for people, so it was quite cramped unless you had a seat in the sectioned off area.

Having been raving about the place to a friend, I took him for drinks on Wednesday and was left somewhat embarrassed The outside bar area is now 75% cordoned off, with access only allowed if you have a dinner reservation or buy a bottle of champagne. I asked the security staff how long this has been the rule and was told rather abruptly that 'this has always been the case'. It most certainly as not as I've been coming since the place opened. -this seems to be a new thing in the last few weeks. (I'd also called in advance to see if there were any party bookings and if the whole pace was open and had been told it was). We then had to squeeze in to a tiny area with a lot of other people while most of the reserved area remained empty. This resulted in us constantly being knocked by the bar staff who were struggling to get through the customers.  We then ordered drinks. Sushi Samba have massively reduced their cocktail menu. Fair enough, but we ordered one normal cocktail and one non-alcoholic and were charged the same full price for both. -\u00a325 for two drinks! One of which was no more than juice and soda water. I asked if this was correct (non alco cocktails always were charged at \u00a36.50 each on previous visits). I was they don't do non alcoholic cocktails?!? (they do, I've had them and they were delicious!) And beside these ones contained ' special' ingredients. Not sure how elderflower cordial and soda water constitute 'special' and a \u00a312.50 charge.  It's a real shame Sushi Samba are going down this route. It used to be a great place to visit, but I'd struggle to recommend it while they are implementing silly rules and ripping off their customers.  I note they are still charging service charge when you buy your drinks at the bar too. This is disgraceful considering we can't exactly jump over the bar and make them ourselves.

On 27/07/2013 we stayed in London (for my partner's birthday. A special treat), at the lovely Andaz hotel on Liverpool Street, just around the corner from the Heron Tower and Sushisamba.  Upon returning to the hotel, we found that the cocktail bar had closed. We asked the Concierge where else we could go, as that night I had proposed to my girlfriend and we had just got engaged. Understandably, we were over the moon and didn't want the night to end.  After being directed to Sushisamba, we made our way over to the entrance, upon which we were \"greeted\" by a sneering Asian (stated only to help identify this individual to the management, if they care) \"gentleman\" who basically treated us as though we were scum. We were accused of being drunk and not fitting in with their desired clientele, basically. I'd like to thank this cretin personally for putting a huge dent in our celebrations and for ensuring that we will never return to Sushisamba, nor will any of our family or friends now that they know how people are treated there.  When we returned to the hotel and informed the Concierge, he was horrified and arranged for a bottle of wine to be sent straight to our room by way of apology.

This was my 3rd visit at Sushi Shambles since the opening and it will be my last.  My first visit was last year shortly after they opened and service and food was atrocious. I remember ordering desserts and left 40 min later with no dessert. The food was terrible, service even worse, but being in the hospitality industry myself I know that the first 3 to 6 months can sometimes be a bit touch and go, so I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought I might return at a later stage when they are more settled in. My second visit was in February and although the service was poor, the food had drastically improve, my favorite dish being the monk fish (that gets sliced at the table) and little meat skewers with aji panca and corn. My third visit however, was the worst. Got interrogated by a very rude chap at the door and now apparently there is a dress code. This takes away from the casual, South American theme and certainly Sushi Samba Miami would close its doors if they had a dress code policy. After a heated debate I was allowed in. Reach the top in a lift ride that is exhilarating and not a friendly face in site. Staff must be really unhappy at this place and it shows. Being in the hospitality industry myself, I understand the meaning of the word, but clearly no one here does, especially the arrogant French management. Apparently they are turning around more head chefs than tables, yet the food is ok (except for the Monk fish, that is now served with a horrible orange butter sauce that better suits something from China town) The desserts are good, but I suspect some of it is bought in as I have seen the exact Mochi ice cream dessert at Novikov a while back.  Bottom line ok'e, if Sushi Shambles was a restaurant on the ground floor in  London, it would be closed by now as the views is the only wow factor here.", "date_of_review": "23 August 2013"}

It was a special occasion so I wanted to go somewhere nice. I have never been there before but I read the reviews previous to our visit and had really high expectations.  We arrived half an hour early and decided to go for a drink on the terrace where we could enjoy our \"Cocktails\" for about 10 minutes \u00b4as we first had to wait 10 minutes until somebody came to our table and then another 10 minutes until our drinks were served. Quite annoying but I just thought it can't get worse. If you go to a place which is quite expensive and where you even be advised to come in Smart clothing, you have high expectations not only about the food but also about the Service. After our Cocktails somebody showed us to our table. Our waiter welcomed us very friendly and explained us everything on the menu. As we've never been there before, we ordered his recommendations. The first course came and we had no cutlery/chopsticks, no glasses and no napkins. We had to ask for it and as we only got the chopsticks my father finally had to get the napkins by himself. It happened 3 times that a waiter served something we actually didn't order. I always had to ask \"our\" waiter if that is the food we ordered - \"oh no - that's not yours\" he answered. He wasn't really bothered anymore. On top of that they charged us 60pounds more for dishes and drinks we never ordered and dishes we ordered but never reached our table. I had to tell them that there is something wrong with the bill, they would have just charged 60 more. I don't want to know how many people do not doublecheck their bill before they make the payment. So although the food was delightful and outstanding and the views were amazing everything together was a total clanger. I would never go there again.", "date_of_review": "23 August 2013"}

First the weather was magnificent and one of those evenings you so rarely get in England, soft and balmy with clear skies all the way to the horizon, the view really is something and for someone from Hong Kong that was really very special. The lift ride was fun but for one who lives in a high rise nothing too special, the bar on the other hand is very special and was incredibly busy, a large tree dominates with a circular bar and tables surrounding it. The food was delicious and served in small portions to be eaten with chopsticks, some of the dishes were so good we re-ordered them. The contrast between the sushi type dishes and the traditional Brazilian meats was something to remember and clearly is very successful. Desserts were original and imaginative especially the organic red chocolate chilli peppers. Wine was very expensive but then this is a very special place and one should be prepared to pay high prices for such a top location Service was of a very high standard with our table server taking great care to make sure we had a great evening, management was highly visible and not the least bit arrogant, I came away with a menu signed by Executive Chef Claudio Cardoso and General Manager Romain Pottier.

Drinks at the bar are expensive but what would you expect considering the location. They have an outside terrace too with a heated area it looks. Must be great during summer nights. We had a window seat and the restaurant itself is not that big. I think it must look better at night than during the day. Anyhow, we were greeted with smiles, I think it helps when attending for a special occasion. The food was great...you could taste the high quality. As with the drinks, the food is also quite expensive but again what do you expect? They provided some nice gestures in giving us a fresh bowl of rice when our main dish came out even though we only ordered one portion with starters. They also gave a free desert, well it was only chocolate macaroons but its the gesture that counts. Service was great from most of the staff, others seemed like they had enough of serving!

I've had better sushi from the corner sushi shop elsewhere, for a fraction of the price. When I think South American / Japanese fusion, I think traditional sushi fused with South American ingredients, but that zing was missing. It was regular sushi. The non-sushi food was good though. The miso grilled seabass was to die for, and so was the yellowtail taquito.  The ceviche was average - I've eaten better in cheaper places in South America. The desserts were huge and looked fancy, but there was nothing extraordinary, or even above average, about them.

We were promptly seated upon arriving. One of us ordered a coke and it was flat. Took a long time for the waiter to replace it for us, and when it finally arrived, they had brought us a diet coke. We got the right coke finally and it came in a glass bottle. So not too sure how the first coke was flat if it's fresh out of the bottle. Ordered some edamame and padron peppers while we waited for the rest of the group to turn up and only the edamame arrived. We had to order the padron peppers again. I wouldn't bother with padron peppers again next time as they arrived borderline cremated. At this point, expectations were quite low. And then, the rock shrimp tempura and the pork belly wrap turned up and WOW, how the table has turned. The rock shrimp tempura was seriously amazing. It's the kinda food you put in my mouth and all you want to do is savour every flavour and texture you have going on with that first bite and nothing else matters. The pork belly wrap was also very tasty but there's almost no graceful way to eat a chunky piece of pork belly with a pair of chopsticks. We also had the wagyu tataki which came with foie gras and fried quail egg - more yum! Everything else which came after was absolutely delightful: 1/2 lobster with spicy ikura vinaigrette, Samba London, Ezo, Neo Tokyo and Sasa rolls. It's been a long while since I had sushi so fresh, melt-in-the-mouth, and tasty.  For dessert, we shared chocolate banana cake, mango mousse and yuzu tart cheesecake amongst us. The chocolate banana cake was a clear winner in terms of taste but the yuzu tart cheesecake was very well presented. With the restaurant filling up by the time we were ready to leave (around 7.30pm), we had a hard time flagging our waiter for the bill.

The initial impression is a nice midern rooftop restaurant . The food was good but over priced, one of the main courses was \u00a347 and was disappointing for that price. The drinks we ordered with the main course came when we'd reached plate 5 and after reminding them 3 times. It took 15 minutes to bring a dessert menu and a further 20 to actually come and take the order. We ended up asking for bill instead of dessert. After such a long wait we just wanted to leave!

The elevator to the 38th Floor was very quick & an experience with superb views. We had pre-dinner drinks out on the terrace. There is a beautiful full sized tree in the centre of the bar lit perfectly with warm ambient fairy lights. A fantastic fire pit to keep warm together with live flamed burners scattered thoughtfully. Our Waiter was second to none! His name was Max & he was French. Ask for him to serve you - he was amazing. We trusted him to choose our food for us (he asked about allergies and dislikes). He didn't disappoint. The food was pretty in appearance & had flavours beyond belief.  After dinner we took our drinks outside to take in the panorama of London by night.

Not a great start and my friend was forced to go home, get changed and come back. After being ignored for several minutes, we were (not) greeted by the most arrogant barman I have ever encountered. I honestly thought he was looking to start a fight, the way he was carrying on. When asking about which champagnes were available and what the prices were, he proceeded to mock us with comments such as \"oh, if this one is too expensive we serve shampoo\". Terrible jokes aside, we bought an extremely overpriced bottle and were ushered into the cordoned off area, on the roof terrace. I should point out that a few of the other bar staff were excellent and very well mannered - such a shame they are let down by their idiot co-worker. As we were leaving we felt condescended enough to quietly complain to the bar manager who really could not have cared less about what we were saying. I can honestly say I have NEVER experienced such awful and rude service and will certainly make a point of steering people away from this place.

The petite lady on the door was adamant no one was getting through. So with knowledge from the lady that the bar was full my friend and I hung around for 10 minutes to see if enough people left. Low and behold lifts of about a dozen people left, so I attempted to see if we could now go up. After a phone call to upstairs (and for some reason being told it was 2 females may have helped) we were allowed up.  The lift was amazing, flying up the side of a building in a glass cube to 40 stories had me shaking once we reached the top! We walked into the bar and it was empty?!  Anyway we took pictures of the view, sat down, perused the cocktail menu and didn't recognise a single ingredient haha, so chose a recommendation from the barman. A lagerita, a nice bottle brahma lager with added tequila and lime - yum!  It felt really chilled out up there, in the middle of the bar was a large golden tree with fairy lights, in the corner was a fire pit surrounded by sofas, the music was funky and when it started raining they handed you a brolly.

Without going into details they made us feel like we were lucky to be there and did well to listen to their superior advice...order something outside of their recommendations (based on making you spend more than you might have planned) and they actually used clear body language that said \"your mistake then...\" e.g. beer instead of sake or not balancing all 3 nationality influences in your menu choice.

After all this unique position offered by this place is the reason why you put up with premium prices they charge, right? Only that you don\u2019t get any views. Let\u2019s get it straight \u2013 the only view you are ever to get from your trip to Sushi Samba is during your 15 seconds journey in the glass elevator. Then you might catch a glimpse of the Gurkin from one of the bars, from behind the backs of other punters crowded under the stairs (this place was designed by a moron) and that\u2019s it. The terrace bar has a view of an extended roof below and the sky above - enjoy. The glass-clad walls of the restaurant have a side view to this extended roof on one side and to another terrace (for private parties) on the other. The only place where you could catch a panoramic sight of London (to its east, less attractive side anyway) is the front window. There are three tables at this window; however they are closely guarded by the restaurant\u2019s numerous staff, whose only job seems to be protecting theses precious assets from unworthy crowd. Even if you book a table explicitly asking for one with a view, you won\u2019t get it (perhaps unless you have an OBE or are at least \u00a30.5 billion net worth). This bizarre policy is nonsense, especially as in our case, all three tables remained unoccupied throughout our entire stay at Sushi Samba.

Pointing this out to the security was answered with 'If they have a reservation we make exceptions' Even though our party had a reservation for dinner apparently the same exceptions of the 'dress code' was not extended to us.  The manner and tone of these 'doorman' was unbelievable. Then he proceeded to say that we were rude and that this was the reason we were not allowed in today, calming one of our party swore at him.

We're sad to say that we were left feeling very disappointed - the food preparation appeared rushed, the service was inattentive and the attention to detail was lacking. Whilst it should be noted that my first visit in February was much better, I found it rather disappointing that in the four months between visits cutbacks had been made: the food quality was poorer and even their selection of the local English Tufa mineral water had been exchanged for a standard high street water! The duck breast was slightly dry and overcooked - and my complaint to staff was met with a shrug. Disappointing.

(To set the scene - I was practically wearing my Sunday best - a long skirt, black silk top and flat leather sandals). I asked her if I was deemed 'not elegant enough', to which she replied that I was 'a bit scruffy'. Seemed a bit rich when she was wearing a poncho and the two people she had let in in-front of me were wearing scruffy trainers, jeans and t-shirts.  With my ego just about intact I continued up to the bar where I spent my time sipping on overpriced champagne, balancing on a wobbly stool, and cursing that I hadn't chosen my 'elegant' trainers and jeans like everyone else around me. Granted the view is good, but we weren't allowed to properly enjoy it due to a 'private function', so the best view I got was when I visited the toilet.

We made our way to the restaurant about 9:30pm to have a drink before and that alone was amazing. The views were unreal and the lit up golden tree on the roof terrace is beautiful! I did really fancy a cocktail out here but was told \"no cocktails\" when I asked for one, a little disappointing (and blunt) but made our way inside to the other bar to get one where you can see the views of the Gherkin, and were greeted by a much friendlier barman who really took time and care to make delicious cocktails all with a smile!  We were shown to our table about 10:10pm so only had to wait an extra 10 minutes and it was very, very busy so I was expecting that. When I made the booking online through Top Table I stated that we were celebrating my Boyfriend's birthday but wasn't expecting anything special as I hadn't followed this up and thought that the message wouldn't have been received anywhere, but was so delighted to hear the waitress say 'Happy Birthday' to my boyfriend as we sat down - a nice touch!  The waiter was really helpful and helped us with the menu to which we ordered 7 plates and he did rope us into trying a very small glass of sake that set us back \u00a314 each I believe!! But we wanted to make the most of the experience and celebration and could have easily said no. The food was delicious - anyone a bit apprehensive about sushi should just try it, it's not the same as what you would buy in supermarkets at all and there were so many flavours and textures to try, I really want to go back! To top it all off - the stunning views, atmosphere, great food - the waitress brought out a birthday dessert for my Boyfriend with a candle which was lovely and made the night really special. After the meal we went out onto another roof terrace next to the restaurant where you get even more great views, it feels like you're standing on top of the gherkin!  The food prices were reasonable it was just the drink prices that set us back but what else can you expect from London. I would definitely recommend.", "date_of_review": "14 July 2013"}

The food is good, but so it is in many London restaurants. You go to Sushi Samba with an expectation to eat while enjoying breathtaking views from the 38th floor, with London at your feet. After all this unique position offered by this place is the reason why you put up with premium prices they charge, right? Only that you don\u2019t get any views. Let\u2019s get it straight \u2013 the only view you are ever to get from your trip to Sushi Samba is during your 15 seconds journey in the glass elevator. Then you might catch a glimpse of the Gurkin from one of the bars, from behind the backs of other punters crowded under the stairs (this place was designed by a moron) and that\u2019s it. The terrace bar has a view of an extended roof below and the sky above - enjoy. The glass-clad walls of the restaurant have a side view to this extended roof on one side and to another terrace (for private parties) on the other. The only place where you could catch a panoramic sight of London (to its east, less attractive side anyway) is the front window. There are three tables at this window; however they are closely guarded by the restaurant\u2019s numerous staff, whose only job seems to be protecting theses precious assets from unworthy crowd. Even if you book a table explicitly asking for one with a view, you won\u2019t get it (perhaps unless you have an OBE or are at least \u00a30.5 billion net worth). This bizarre policy is nonsense, especially as in our case, all three tables remained unoccupied throughout our entire stay at Sushi Samba.

We asked for recommendations and to be honest wish we hadn't. A nice touch was the restaurant had remembered from my booking that it was my wife's birthday, and a complimentary desert with \"happy birthday\" was presented. Would we go again no, would we recommend it, not unless they guarantee the staff have had extensive training in customer service.

Wow factor of amazing views but delighted that the food and service was spot on too! Surprised by some of the other reviews but perhaps if you only 'pop in' for a drink the experience is different..... We were celebrating our son's engagement on Father's Day early evening so the restaurant was busy from the end of the lunchtime service and filled up again as the evening went on. However, this only added to the exciting buzz and razzamatazz atmosphere. Right from arrival the service was terrific. The doorman explained the lift, floor number, reception handed us over to the sitter who took us to a booth-type table with panoramic views and introduced our waiter who was brilliant. Just the right amount of lively humour and attentiveness, recommending dishes, drinks etc. The food was wonderful and we took his advice and sampled a range of deliciously fresh and interesting sharing plates including sushi, taquitos, grilled meats, lobster, samba rolls and hot stone beef - all devine! Puds were equally delightful and the 'Congratulations' peach plate at the end was a great finish! A stunningly visual restaurant experience with excellent feel-good factor in design and concept. It appears it attracts people going for drinks just to experience the views but we feel it is primarily a restaurant NOT a tourist attraction and as such we would definitely return and recommend but as with all restaurants in the city - pre-book!", "date_of_review": "17 June 2013"}

As mentioned in some of the other reviews, the door staff seem to have started taking an interest in how much you've had to drink before arriving. I suppose this is acceptable - it's a late night bar that will attract a lot of customers after nearby pubs close, so I can certainly understand why they'd want to keep anyone who's too drunk and likely to be disruptive outside.  We had planned to have another couple of drinks and a plate or two of sushi in the bar, but after we arrived we thought we'd check whether or not a table might be available in the restuarant, and were given a great spot right in the window. The views here are spectacular, night or day, it's really worth visiting even if only for a drink, so getting a good table was really appreciated.  I also love the sushi here - it's original, fresh, well-made, and they definitely pull off the Japanese / Brazilian fusion flavours like nowhere else I've ever been.

Very rude behaviour at the entrance. The blond girl responsible for the reservations at the ground floor on Saturday night the 8th of June let people without reservations get in through the reservations queue whilst there were 60 other people standing waiting in the cold. At one point the bouncer realized that she let people get in without any reservation and he told her off. The bouncers preferred to send the lift half-empty with people who \u2018had\u2019 reservations instead of letting in people who were waiting at the queue. The quality of a place is always reflected on the way its bouncers behave. This is the main reason I\u2019m not gonna visit Sushi Samba again. 2. Astonishing view is the biggest + of the bar. The space is having architectural mistakes though; it is having an impressive and original interior design but the view is blocked at many places because of unfortunate interior solutions.  3. Prices are just ok for the quality of drinks.  4. The staff was polite enough (apart from the unfortunate behavior at the entrance of course).", "date_of_review": "9 June 2013"}

Service unprofessional", "comment": "We had an eclectic selection of food and each choice was excellent! Each of the 5 of us were so happy with our choice of restaurant as the food was delicious.  Although the service was relatively good throughout the dinner, it took a turn at the end of the night when the bill came. The service charge was included in the bill and as there was no reason not to tip our servers and as such paid the bill with the service charge included. However, upon paying the bill we must have miscalculated and missed the full 12.5% which equalled \u00a35. So instead of the server receiving \u00a330 he received \u00a325. This was unintentional oversight on our part. The shocking part of the story was that the server returned the \u00a325 to the table and stated that the full service charge was missing.  One of our friends, who owns and operates a successful restaurant was shocked at his behaviour as it appeared as though he was attempting to manipulate the table into giving him the full service charge. In my view, a very passive aggressive AND risky measure to make as we left the table, taking our change with us. Not too bright on his part. A different way of handling the situation would have been for him to ask if everything had been to our satisfaction. This would have triggered us into thinking that we had made a mistake and he most likely would have been given more than the 12.5% service charge.  Overall the food was excellent, the view outstanding, the service was satisfactory but the expected service charge was definitely too reliant on being the new \"trendy\" and \"place to be\" in London.", "date_of_review": "9 June 2013"}

Cocktails were small for the price, which included a 12% service?! But they looked and tasted good.  We got a great seat by the window with amazing views. Sadly the terrace was closed due to windy conditions, but looked gorgeous with lots of twinkly lights. The music was great, commercial stuff, we could have stayed there a lot longer. The vibe was fun and relaxed, seemed to be a lot of suits and corporate outings though so we moved on after midnight.

We actually ended up having 5 people attend. We were quite pleased as the hostess was very accommodating and able to add an extra chair to our table, including the unexpected friend. We were delighted and impressed by the service and atmosphere we encountered upon arrival to the restaurant and it really seemed to exceed our expectations. The drinks at the bar were fantastic, the host staff was extremely welcoming and the view and overall ambience of the place were incredible.    The service continued to be very good after we were seated and attended to. Our drinks were ordered and received promptly, and our food was absolutely outstanding and delivered correctly. We really felt very special and attended to during the first half of our experience.    The problems started arising towards the end of our dinner. There seemed to be a number of birthdays going on around us and the staff was concentrating on these larger tables \u2013 which is understandable to a point. However, we felt that we were still paying customers, like the remainder of the other tables, and expected the great service we had in the beginning to continue throughout the night. Our drinks were empty for 15 minutes without anyone coming to attend to them prior to us having to ask for more.  Upon booking the table on TopTable, I advised that we were celebrating my friend\u2019s upcoming wedding and requested something special for her. I was pleased as an employee rang me the day prior to the booking and asked if I would like a special dessert with a message on it which I thought was great. I advised that I would like the message to say \u201cIt\u2019s about time, [friend's name]\u201d which the employee said would be no problem. On the night of our dinner before the dessert was brought out, the server came round showing me the typed message to make sure it was correct, which I confirmed. Once the server brought the dessert out, it said round the plate \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d and the staff started singing to us. I quickly told them it was not Heather\u2019s birthday and they had made a mistake. This was yet another letdown for the evening as it made me think that my friend felt we had gotten the dessert wrong and had not pre-planned for her as we had. Also, when the staff brought the dessert, they took all of our dessert menus and never asked us if we wanted extra desserts, after-dinner drinks, coffees or anything else \u2013 again showing poor upselling skills by your staff because we were keen for more drinks and desserts and felt quite dismissed like we were not as important as the other guests. We had to get a server\u2019s attention to come back over with the dessert menus to order our desserts and drinks.    Then the bill came. We split the bill differently between the 5 of us as some people were paying on credit card and others cash. We thought we had paid the exact amount which was listed on the bill, including the 12.5% gratuity charge added, and provided this to the server. We were finishing up our drinks and about to leave when the server abruptly came back with \u00a325 in the tray. He rudely put the tray with the money in the middle of the table in front of us. He then stated with a discourteous tone that we were \u00a35 short on the bill with the service charge so he was refunding the entire service charge for us. He then hastily went off without saying anything else or asking us if we had unintentionally miscalculated (which is exactly what we had done). The server was actually incorrect and we were not \u00a35 as he was claiming. Our bill had come to \u00a3248.06. Of that, the 12.5% service charge was 27.56. We gave him \u00a325 \u2013 unintentionally missing \u00a32.56. We could not believe that someone who was supposed to be serving us had reacted in such an embarrassing and completely inappropriate manner after we had spent nearly \u00a3250 and were expecting a carefree, beautiful dining experience where our friend would be made to feel like she was being pampered and spoiled in preparation for her marriage.  We ended up taking the remainder of the gratuity and left quite angrily and upset. We did this because the service had slacked so much towards the end of the evening as well as how we were treated at the end by the server in regards to the payment. I have never refused to tip a server in my life as I have been a server in the past so this was quite unusual for me.  I will not be patronizing Sushisamba ever again because of this negative experience and I wanted to let other potential customers know. It is quite a shame because the food, view and atmosphere was great, but I have never felt so worthless and expendable as I had that night.", "date_of_review": "10 June 2013"}

Apparently there was no drinks menu and his response to the question 'well what do you serve?' was 'wine and champagne'. No attempt at describing which wine or champagne. We ended up going for 2 glasses of pink champagne which we ended up paying through the roof for, undoubtedly because he chose the most expensive bottle and there was no menu with prices for us to look at.

We had to book this Friday night slot two months in advance but I would say it was worth it, I saw some people waiting nearly all night and couldn't get a table - would say though that I am surprised as at least 4 tables around us were empty (we arrived 6.30 and left around 9). 1) Service - was good, had to queue to get into the building and then had to queue again once on the 38th floor. Wasn't always sure where I had to go next. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. I would say though initially, the platters came very quickly, we barely had time to put our forks down before the next plate came, would have preferred a little breathing time between the courses.  2) Food - was excellent! The menu was broken down into four different categories (selection of raw dishes, samba rolls and differently cooked food on BBQ) and then a large platter menu. We were two couples and chose about 2 dishes from each category and then 1 from the large platter (meat platter was amazing). The food portions were tiny - but very delicious. No complaints at all (to be fair not very cheap - but you know that going in). 3) Drinks - fairly good selection, overpriced even by City standards. Glass of wine would set you back about \u00a310, beers were pretty competitive if you like Japanese, Peruvian or Brazilian variety.  4) Ambiance - the restaurant spreads over 2 floors (38 and 39) in Heron Tower. The 38th floor has the restaurant, the sushi bar and an outdoor bar/ terrace, as well as some outside dining. Amazing views of London on a clear day, pretty much in whatever direction you look. The 39th floor has another bar type area and the washrooms. I have to say the washrooms had the best views of London - now how many places can say that? After dinner, we went up to the bar and had drinks till midnight - dj playing some music but not excessively busy like some places can get in the City on a Friday night.

This greeting was one of the few interactions we had with the staff who milled around in large numbers, but who were reluctant to offer any kind of service. We had ordered hot sake to accompany our food. The sake eventually turned up, but it was pretty cold by the time that the food made its appearance. The first unfortunate example of fusion is that instead of serving the sake in pottery cups and jar, as in Japanese restaurants, it comes in sherry glasses and glass bottle. Is this the Peruvian contribution to the \"fusion\"? The sashimi was carved off blocks of frozen fish and was not much improved by the heaped granules of sea salt. The meat dishes were gelatinous, probably from being left lying around waiting for a waiter to finish socialising to fit in a customer. This place is vastly over-rated and vastly inferior to any even average Japanese restaurant. We refused to pay the service charge, which is only the second time we have done this in restaurant-going over a 40 year period.", "date_of_review": "5 June 2013"}

We were taken to Suchisamba by our son and his wife, and were more than a little surprised to find our reservation was for 5.15 pm. Why so early?

The food was amazing, a fusion of Peruvian, Brazilian and Japanese, beautifully cooked and presented, and served expertly by our waiter, who took time to explain the dishes to us. All the staff were friendly, and lightening fast. There was an accident on the next table, where glassware was broken. No damage was done to ourselves, but we had two apologies within seconds, and the fragments were secured and disposed of very quickly. The wine selection was good, if pricy, and the wine waiter was a master both of timing and precision.

It was during the Xmas break. I have not been to the upstairs bar as it\u2019s busy, but have been out side and downstairs; they made a special cocktail for my son. The view is amazing. On our client dinner, we had the wagu beef, which was a real treat, but also the sashimi is also very good and the Brazilian Pork belly is also good. There were 8 of us and the dishes are 4 to 5 bites per portion. So we ordered 5 starters and the sushi platters plus one main and the beef. We all shared and it was fun and enough. Do not over order to start with, it is easy to get carried away and since the dishes come quickly its better to top up.

There was nowhere to sit as most people appeared to be there just for drinks. Diners were standing in a queue waiting to be seated in the restaurant. Some had been there 45 mins and were already more than half an hour past their booking time. Repeated enquiries by many in the queue went unanswered. Management were nowhere to be seen and the ladies on the front desk appeared to be so at ease with the situation we drew the conclusion that this shoddy way of treating customers was normal. A complimentary glass of wine that eventually was offered to everyone was no substitute for what should have been a special night out with friends.

When we were seated our waiter was extremely helpful with the menu, and he kept coming back throughout the night without being too hands on, a balance difficult to get right. The dishes he recommended were our particular favourites (beef gyoza), and at the end he brought over an amazing dessert with a candle in & 'happy birthday' piped in chocolate (my boyfriend didn't even ask for this, the waiter had asked if it was a special occasion when I went to the bathroom), a nice touch :) We ended up departing our table at approx 7.55pm, but not once did we feel pressured to leave or were rushed, which is great considering the place was busy by that time.  The bill came to \u00a3109 with service, this was for approx 7 small plates to share (which we found enough for the 2 of us), plus 2 glasses of wine and 1 beer.

The location of the restaurant is incredibly difficult to beat - the nature of London's skyline is such that buildings like this tend to stick out, but with very few buildings which match the height of the Heron Tower in London the views from the restaurant section are uninterrupted to the North and East, from our table we could see both the Olympic Park and Canary Wharf - we were dining on a spectacular day for weather so the view as the sun set was fantastic as was the night time view that followed.  Four of us were dining and there was one birthday in the group - after a glass elevator ride to the top floor we were greeted by very friendly staff who wished a happy birthday to our member of the group, we were seated promptly and it was clear they had made a conscious effort to ensure our table had a good view. As ever in places like this the service makes a huge difference, I am pleased to say our waiter Marco was a very friendly and polite individual who clearly explained the menu to us as well as the sizes of the dishes (which is hugely important here).  The quality of the food was very high, much of the sushi had a South American twist which was a great touch - I eat a lot of sushi so this made a great change, ideas like Yellowtail in taco shells and mini Pork Belly sushi were both interesting and tasted fantastic. Things not to miss are the Shrimp Tempura and the Black Cod Miso, the Sushi Samba rolls and if you are hungry enough to order a large plate (which are for sharing) the selection of Kobe Beef, Chorizo and Fillet Steak - the meat was fantastic, although I would imagine they are all very tasty.  You need money to eat here! Although one does get full as plate after plate arrives it is not a night which can be done effectively on a budget, everything from the cocktails (which are very creative), wine list and food is very expensive but it is important to bear in mind the restaurant chain you are eating in (which is very well known worldwide) and the location you are in! Many people have complained about the price - do not go expecting bargains.  As the title of the review would suggest, the food views and service make this place a rather special experience - I found the serving staff to all be very tentative, observant and extremely helpful in explaining the content of the food and where it was sourced from. The staff here clearly have a good knowledge of the food they are serving (and a good knowledge of London from 245 metres).  Thank you for a truly impressive evening.", "date_of_review": "27 April 2013"}

Neither of us had tried quality sake before, but this was fantastic. Wish I could remember the bloody name of it! We also asked for a wine recommendation.

Even entering the restaurant is exciting. The lift (very speedily) whisks you up to the 38th floor where you a met by a friendly maitre'd and a beautiful bar area. Unfortunately, as I visited on a Sunday, the 39th floor bar was not open, but luckily the outdoor area still was. It is sort of a surreal situation, you are high above the city of London with a beautiful view of the skyline and on top of this building is a large tree covered in lights (not as tacky as it sounds) and open fires. The food itself was good. Not the best sushi I have ever had by far, but still delicious and presented beautifully. I would personally recommend the beef tataki from the small plates menu. The menu was quite pricey but that is only to be expected in such a beautiful setting. However, we did find the waiting staff to be very pushy and despite ordering more food than we could manage, it seemed the waiter was trying to make us order food that we did not want and after saying no, he almost seemed to be annoyed at us.

I was expecting ok-to-not-nice food, after seeing some reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Sushi was fresh and tasty. I especially loved little taquitos made with minced raw tuna and jalapeno - crunchy, spicy, and fresh. Also great was robata black cod, perfectly done, like pats of butter on a stick. Wagyu beef dumplings were a little greasy and heavy but overall, great food. And very efficient and friendly service. Downside was price - we got away for just under \u00a3100 a head - but granted we did eat ourselves silly and had many cocktails. We overstayed our three hour time slot but no one urged us on.

Rang the day before to see what time was best as I understood that it gets very busy with diners and we just wanted cocktails. The info service said to get there before 630 or after 930. We arrived at 430 only to be told by the doorman that they were busy and we would have to wait till 5 when the second floor opened. We waited in the pouring rain and chilling wind to enter even though the lobby entrance was empty. Eventually we entered the lift.... Which is a wow, zoomed up in seconds to the 38 floor. Fantastic view of London. The bar very edgy and colourful, couldn't see the restaurant a you are not allowed to view unless you are eating. Very disappointing! The view is absolutely what people go for. Nice cocktails but nothing really under a tenner. We were going to order a bar snack of sushi of 7 pieces but as it was over 50 quid decided against it. There isn't many places to sit mainly side seating. I asked the barman if we could sit in a room that I found just off of the bar. He said yes so we moved to go into the room then was very rudely told by the manager that we couldn't......... What a very rude man he was..... I am sure the success of this place is absolutely not due to his managing or customer care skills. In fact many of the staff had an attitude problem except for our waitress, she was lovely! This place is defiantly worth a visit but take plenty of money especially if you want to eat. The surroundings are great but I can't help thinking if it wasnt where it was with the view that it has it wouldn't be so popular and the staff would have to try harder. I do think this place would have been much more enjoyable if the staff had a more welcoming persona. It doesn't feel wam and inviting. It's the view that draws people in!

Highly recommend this and would rate it over the upstairs restaurant the duck and waffle ", "date_of_review": "7 April 2013"}

Our food came out in time, it wasnt a lengthy wait. My partner ordered the duck, I ordered the calamari, some starters etc. food tasted amazing, the duck was cooked perfectly (even though they didnt ask us how we wanted it) The cocktails great. I like the touch of sugar cane on the side.  You should all definitely visit, we missed our reservations and another table was available 15minutes later, even though we did go on a Sunday.

Some of the prices as well were eye raising for such small quantity. The funniest moment for us however was when one of our party told one of the staff the toilet had run out of hand towels - so she passed him a stack of hand towels and asked him to go back in and put them in there himself. They did knock us off a decent amount on the bill however they shouldn't have had to if the service had been up to scratch.

We arrived early and it was a Tuesday night. It was busy but not that busy but on average it took us 15 minutes to get drinks..twice!! This was really frustrating as the bar area was not crowded but clearly there were not enough people serving. Regardless of the fact we had to wait, we were then slapped with a service charge on Both occasions when we went to the bar! Service for what?!! The bartender hadn't even poured our bottle of wine! We had a table booked for 9.30pm. After constantly asking if it was ready and being told 'in a miunte' we were seated at 10pm!! This really isn't acceptable when you have booked a table in advance..on a Tuesday night!  The blonde American girl on the desk couldn't care less and was too busy chatting to her friend even though the table situation was clearly out of hand (a lot of other diners were also waiting). When we got inside the service improved and the waiters tried to make amends. But after being told we would be looked after by one person, they seemed to change over and it all felt quite false as they clearly didn't care about the customer. The food just summed up the whole evening - average food, dressed up to be something else. Some dishes were better than others but everything seemed to be quite obviously pretentious. It is pretty pricey and I think if Sushisamba don't sort out their service, customers will go elsewhere. For the same amount of money you can have Michelin starred cuisine with exceptional service. They may have the view but they need to start living up to their expectations. ", "date_of_review": "28 March 2013"}

We were in a nearby pub and decided to swing by to see if we could get into the lounge and have a drink or two. First we turned up at about 9.30 pm and the queue seemed quite long. I asked the security guy how long the wait would roughly be, to which he said he didn't know (although later that night he miraculously developed the ability to estimate the waiting time to other people who asked. Perhaps I got him at a wrong time). So we left and went back to the pub, had more drinks, returned just before 11 pm, and queued for about 30-35 mins. Not too bad (without reservation) but it was a bit frustrating, especially when we saw so many people trying to blag their way in. The lady who managed the queue was nice, though.  We got to the lounge, and the view was incredible. Minus points - long wait to get any drinks at the bar, and many people there were quite drunk. This created a rather downmarket atmosphere. We decided to ask if we could get a table at the restaurant proper (there is a sushi bar in the lounge, but the place was too loud/busy). The ladies at the restaurant reception table were very nice, and luckily they got us a table after 20 mins wait (then again, this was already 11.30 pm).  We ordered 3 dishes to share - one ceviche (about \u00a312, nice seasoning, unfortunately some pieces of the fish were slightly tough and sinewy), one salmon roll (about \u00a312. very nice. no complaints there), and grilled chicken teriyaki skewers (\u00a38 for 2 skewers I think, decent enough. not best teriyaki I've tasted. Although boasting organic chicken, the taste of the chicken itself was rather lacking). The portion sizes were on the small-ish side. It was a light late-night grazing which knocked us back about \u00a350 (no alcoholic drinks, just a bottle of fizzy water to share). But we knew the sort of price you can expect from this place before we decided to go, so no surprise there. Giles Coren (the food critic) reckons you pay more premiums the higher the restaurant is located. I think that is quite true.  But the overall experience was very pleasant. The service was good throughout our meal. The view was fantastic, and the food, overall, was very decent. Personally I wouldn't choose this place based purely on the quality of the food, but perhaps for the combinations of things. For me it's the view which tips the scale.", "date_of_review": "29 March 2013"}

Yes. Absolutely. I went with 4 friends for my birthday and loved it. The joyride starts (quite literally) in the glass elevator which zips you up 38 floors with effortless speed. Once inside, you walk along a dark, wooden corridor (wondering what on earth to expect) and emerge somewhat elated on top of London. The feeling does not go down. We were quickly whisked to our seats and the waiter was on hand to welcome us and take a drinks order. He (the waiter) asked if this was our first time (it was) and took time to tell us a little bit about the place. The time was about 6pm and the restaurant was about half full so this was very much appreciated. The food was incredible (providing you like that, steak on a skewer, raw fish thing) and came quickly. It was on the expensive side, however, this is London, in a niche restaurant in a location with a difference. Expect the prices to reflect that. Anything wrong with it? Well, having a bit more time there (we'd been given a time slot) would've been nicer but alas all was not lost as we slipped down the lift and into the nearest bar.

The views over London are stunning so for me a really fun, funky special place to come to especially if the weather is good.

The waiters are helpful as the menu could be a bit confusing ie there's sushi but also south american dishes. Our food was excellent, beautifully presented and the portion size was perfect.

Sashimi, Ngiri and Rolls all feature, plus a range of offerings cooked on the Robata grill. It is an exciting and extensive menu and the food looks very tempting. We were going to go for a range of small tasting plates but the sight of the Churrasco Rio Grande, a mixed plate of Wagyu Picanha, Ribeye and Chorizo with dips changed our minds. It wasn't as good as it looked unfortunately. Good, but not amazing beef. Thoroughly enjoyed our selection of tasting plates though and an assiette for pudding was fantastic. Service was attentive and fun, we were blessed with a real character from Tuscany who provided a laugh as well as good service. The restaurant interior is trendy and airy but not a particularly thrilling design, I guess they figure the views provide the glory. And they do. Sushisamba occupies the 38th floor of Heron Tower so the views are far reaching and there are outdoor areas for soaking these up on sunnier days. It is an enjoyable environment and buzzes with atmosphere. Our wine wasnt adequately chilled which is unforgiveable at these mark ups but this was rectified satisfactorily.

Unfortunately the outdoor TreeBar was closed, as it was very cold, the inside bar was simply a mess, not enough seating, and the bar layout is so badly designed. We eventually got served by the barman who was the love child of Mr Miserable and Mrs Slow. taking about 8 minutes to make 4 drinks without any acknowledgement of others waiting for drinks around us. The bar was busy ( but not packed) with people that looked as if they were simply trying to get out of the cold, coats and the days shopping all over the place. The bar clientele were very young and casual, I was beginning to get concerned that we ( Mid 40's) were in the wrong place. Anyway our table was ready for us on time, and the very nice restaurant hostess came to collect us just in time, and then..........WOW, quite simply what a difference, the restaurant is amazing. Immediately the welcome and service impressed ( thanks Martin ), we were given menus, advised of the shared dining concept and recommended a few options.

I therefore emailed the restaurant for a booking, and asked them if there was any form of entertainment/music available on sundays (as it was mothers day) also information about the venue because i have never been before, i received a reply for the booking, but they failed to answer my question about the entertainment/restaurant. The email said they will call me back on the Saturday to confirm the booking which they did not. As i arrived on the Sunday evening, i was greeted at the door by the host, she informed us that i only have the table for 2 hours. a waiter than took me took our table, i was disappointed as this restaurant is located on the 38th floor, and supposed to have a fantastic view, however our table was far away from the window and in fact the layout of the restaurant unless one is sitting by the window you cant see anything. I felt extremely rushed by one of the waiters who did not give us a chance to look at the menu, as soon as we sat down he asked for drinks, i explained that my partner is in the bathroom, and i need to look at the cocktail list, but he was very persistent. upon the waiters return he explained that the food is a taster menu, which involved small portions to share! the restaurant failed to inform me about this when i booked, and i dont recall seeing this on there website. the waiter again was very persistent to take our order, i did not feel comfortable in fact i found it rather rude. The food was average, the sushi did not taste fresh rather refrigerated, the waiter also forgot bits of our order, i can understand if it was busy however it was a causal sunday evening with not alot of customers, i dont understand why our exact table was booked, as it does not have a fantastic view and there are 4 other exact tables empty behind us.The waiter decided to take upon him self to add dishes to my order which i did not ask for ! and specified i do not want. of course when i called him over to explain with attitude he told me he will remove one dish from the bill. As soon as the last dish was removed from the table the waiter asked us for dessert, i could barely take a second to breathe. I told him i wish to wait slightly. My partner wanted to surprise me with a birthday dessert, and informed the waiter from the beginning o the evening. we ordered the sharing dessert, which are small samples of all the dessert menu. Not nice at all! i did not enjoy even one of them, also my partner was disappointed that they did not even bother to put a candle on my dessert as he requested. The bill came very quickly before the dessert was removed, even though i still had more than 20 min for my table. it was very expensive for what we had. after all i left hungry and disappointed that the waiter was rude, and rushing us! we informed the host about him, and how they did not get my birthday dessert. she said they will remove the service charge but did not in the end! I am very disappointed in the service and overall experience, it ruined my birthday! and i will not recommend sushi samba to anyone and will not be returning.", "date_of_review": "13 March 2013"}

We were given a lovely table by the window with a great view of London. The waiters were great, really enthusiastic and made our experience there enjoyable. As vegetarians, a sushi restaurant is not always the best choice, but there were plenty of veggie options for us. Food was brought our quickly and was incredible. We were too full for dessert but the waiters still brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle on it, a nice touch and end to our meal. The cocktails are great too. The only downside it that it is quite pricey! For this reason, I probably wouldn't go back.", "date_of_review": "13 March 2013"}

I must admit I was a never a big fan of sushi only because it's raw. This place however changed my view completely and I realised that as with everything it depends where you go. All the dishes were excellent with the duck risotto and lobster scoring full marks. The wine was recommended by the superb waiter from Malta and turned out to be one of the best I've tried. The deserts are to die for and the whole vibe and ambience is super. The view is the icing on the cake and it was about time for a good restaurant to combine good food with a view and not just relax on its view as a selling point. You can literally see the whole of London and going at night makes all the difference. Considering there is not that many places offering views from above in London this place is worth the whole experience. We went on a week day in order to avoid all the troubles with reservation timings and it paid of as we were sat fairly quickly. If you are asked to wait you can try the bar and gaze at London for a while but the drinks are on the pricy side.", "date_of_review": "14 March 2013"}

We decided to try seven different things, all amazing except the squid which was rubbery and overcooked. We started with the rock shrimp and the wagyu gyoza both delicious. We then went onto sashimi and tried the tiradito trio nothing amazing its sashimi so it does what it says on the tin. From the grill we had the black cod this was our favorite, we also tried the fillet steak and squid. By the time we got to the rolls we were full, but we had ordered the Sao Paulo which was awesome.

I had written to Sushi Samba twice about it and noone has replied. However, they were quick to reply when he emailed to question the bill to make sure they didn't double charge accidently. Duck and Waffle next door had their Valentines meals for \u00a380 for 2 people, so we're not sure where they think they can mislead people into their expensive meal which gave them food poisoning and not even apologise.

So to make sure not to miss this opportunity we sent an e mail 10 days in advance to the Sushi Samba to reserve a table \"possibly with a nice window view\" and someone replied that for a specific day they could reserve a window table for us! and we were extremely happy even because it would be the last day of our holiday!! On wednesday at 09:00 p.m. very punctual we went to Sushi Samba and a man at the bottom of the building checked our reservation and ticked our name form the list and let us take the elevator to the restaurant!! Once we arrived we asked to the lady at the entrance e she verified our resevation and told us to wait for a few minutes at the bar just in front of us!!(the restaurant and the bar were realy crowded ) anyways...we waited for about half an our than we came back to the lady which replied only that we hade to be patient because the restaurant was very busy..but after almost 40 minutes no one gave us news...so we went again to the lady and after arguing a bit she told us that there wasn't a table next to the window available, that they normally do not reserve \"special table\" and that if it was ok for us they had a table at the entrance of the restaurant and maybe after our dinner we could (probably) move to another table next to window..AND THAT WAS ALL THEY COULD DO FOR US!! I believe this is not a correct behavior..i don't want to add anything else..but at the end we left the restaurant without having dinner, WE will never return to this restaurant and more we are convinced that the fact that there are many requests does not justify rude behavior with customers! a simple view is not worth the rudeness watch out!!", "date_of_review": "4 February 2013"}

We ordered the fillet steak robata and the first one we received was fantastic I could not fault the dish and so...as there were 6 of us...we ordered another. The second was like another dish entirely, poorly cooked and presented. Overall the food was very up and down but I will say you must try the green bean and rock shrimp tempura....both incredible dishes...sadly theyre balanced out by equally underwhelming offerings. Despite these facts which normally would have annoyed me we had a good night.

He is a wheelchair user. We were in the area and saw the sign and ended up in an amazing bar and restaurant. Just travelling up in the lift was thrilling (or scary, depending on your response to heights!). We ate casually at the bar, felt welcomed and were appropriately given information about some lesser known food on the menu.by our waiter. It is an expensive experience but imaginative food and very special surroundings made that bearable. I used the ladies loo which was up two steps, off the corridor. This was a lovely, well designed room with good soap and hand lotion. After we had paid our bill, my son said he would like to use the loo. I asked where the accessible toilet was and, with lots of smiles, was asked to wait a moment. After 5 minutes the waiter came back and showed us to a door that led to the accessible toilet. No problem with the access but, no soap!!!! no toilet paper!!! I realised as we left the loo that the staff had had to move a rack of coats to the corridor that leads into and out of the restaurant. Obviously the rack of coats was usually kept in front of the door to the disabled loo. I complained to a member of staff who apologised profusely about the lack of basic facilities in the disabled loo. She then asked me to pass on my comments to the manager, and called him to come to reception. I waited 10minutes for him to arrive....he said sorry!! He then tried to excuse the barrier created by the rack of coats by saying it was very cold outside, and lots of people were wearing coats. Because they had had to move the coat rack to give us access to the loo, it was impossible for us to leave the restaurant until they moved the coat rack back! There was niot room in the corridor for the coat rack and the wheelchir. It's basic, we've just celebrated London's ability to manage an inclusive Olympic experience, and we were made to feel that disabled people matter less at this restaurant.", "date_of_review": "29 January 2013"}

I had a few issues on the telephone earlier that day with somebody from Reservations, though I soon forgot about that when I got there. The lift up to the 38th floor provided stunning views of London and, although I have a fear of heights, I absolutely loved it!  Our coats were taken as soon as we arrived and a member of staff directed me to the terrace as requested. It was a beautifully-decorated terrace with comfortable seating and a relaxed vibe. The blankets provided were a really nice touch for what was quite a windy night. Unfortunately, the bar on the terrace was closed, which was a real shame, as the main bar is quite small and very busy. This meant that it took a while to order drinks. The cocktails were a little pricey, but no more than any other classy establishment in Central London.  We were informed by a member of staff that our table was ready earlier than scheduled, which I was really pleased about. When we were seated, I was approached by a very pleasant member of staff who introduced himself and acknowledged the fact that it was my birthday. A waiter brought the menus over and kindly gave me his torch when he overheard me saying that I couldn't see the menu properly (not to say that it was particularly dark in there!). The staff were all really good humoured and friendly. I'm generally not a huge fan of sushi, but I really enjoyed the taste, quality, variety and presentation of the food. The flavours were strong and distinctive. The waiters came over after we finished our food to sing happy birthday, and presented me with a complimentary dessert. They didn't even seem too annoyed with me when I cluttered the place with wrapping paper after opening all my presents at the table! They cleared the mess with minimal fuss. After dinner we went back to the bar for some more drinks. It's a real shame that the upstairs was closed due to a private function, however, the bar had a good vibe and a great view. Overall, the staff were friendly and attentive, the views were amazing, and the food was great! We all loved the lift so much that on our way out, we decided to go back up for another ride, much to the security man's confusion.

We ended up in London this year. Since I'm always in charge of the new years dinner plans, I spoke with the concierge at our hotel (the Four Seasons Canary Wharf). Soon we were set to experience the Brazillian-Japanese fusion of Sushi Samba on the 38th floor.  Upon arrival, we were elevated 38 floors in the glass elevator on the skin of the building. Should you have a problem with heights, this isn't a ride for you! But if you like one of the highest views in London while not in an airplane, DO IT! We arrived at the restaurant, our coats were checked, and off we went to our table. Had it not been raining, we would have stopped out onto the patio and had a drink. But, it was cold, and raining so we went to our table and got started.  So, our waiter was some Italian guy that was a bit impatient, and seemed to order for us when we were uncertain. Whatever. We are go-with-the-flow men so it was cool. Here's what we ultimately ordered: Yellow tail tacos - Yummy Scallops Tiradit - Yummy Salmon tiraditio - Yummy chicken - we don't remember this. But it was 8 pounds Wild mushrooms - delicious Arroz xon pato - delicious! Hamachi - its hamachi, it was fine sake - Don't remember this!!! mango mousse - excellent chocolata banana cake - um, totally worth it By the end of it, and the beginning of 2013, we had ordered three bottles of wine. The best was the Antinori Cervaro at 110 pounds. If you want something special, order this bottle. We also had the Colin St Aubin (70), and the Vietti Arnies (60).  Yes, it was new years eve. We drank a lot. But through our experience we received great service, especially from the Sommelier. HE WAS AMAZING!

A couple of the dishes were fair in quality but the aubergine was so burnt on the outside it turned to ash in my mouth, chicken skewers were over cooked to a hard chewy texture and burnt as well.  The Venison tataki dish was recommended to us by the waiter and was so bad it made me wretch and run the bathroom. Our final dish was rice that disintegrated at the touch of a chopstick, topped with such a small piece of salmon it was barely detectable, and some melted oily salty cheese. Disgusting.

Food from every corner of the globe. But I am always a little sceptical about fusion - Japanese and Brazilian? Hmmmm. A little apprehensive, I accepted an invitation to lunch at Sushisamba with a client and a colleague. First of all, the setting on the 38th floor of the Heron Tower is amazing. Although we were not next to a window, the views are stunning from wherever you sit. And the restaurant, if a little cavernous, is light and airy. But that's just about all that impressed me really. The menu was ok, nothing special frankly, and the food quality, seasoning and presentation all rather ordinary. We were proposed a tasting selection - great - but the dishes were, well, ordinary and unadventurous as well. I have had good Japanese food and good Brazilian food and one would assume that a fusion would produce a wow factor. Nope, that was missing too. And the portions were lacking on the size front. Maybe my expectations were too high. Who knows. But the weirdest part of all was the service. The server would bring the food to you and explain what it was and then a minute later the waiter would explain it all again. And often the accounts were different! But each vanished as soon as the job was done and trying to attract their attention to have explained (third time) what was what proved futile. The day we went the maitre d' was wearing what could only be described as a day-glo orange long dress. I couldn't work out whether she doubled up as a fire warden as well. Or perhaps she's sponsored by Stabilo and has a set of dresses to match her highlighter pens. I'll never know as I don't think I'll be going back.

An exciting entrance, I felt like I was in a scene from Charlie and the chocolate factory as I shot up the side of the building in the smoothest glass lift. Entrance door was a little elusive, lots of people wandering between the two floors trying to find the entrance as there were no signs.  I really liked the outside terrace with the enormous steel tree in the middle of the bar, it looked quite ghostly as I was there on one of the coldest nights in November, good job there were lots of outside heaters. It is busy, bustling and noisy but great fun too. The staff were very friendly and there was not a single dish I could criticise. I had sashimi, black cod and an assortment of seviche, all perfect. The best thing of all was the cocktail recommended by the waiter, the chamomile gimlet, I've spent the last month trying to make my own cordial to replicate this at home. Not a place to go on a new date but great for those who like to experiment with their food and drink and need a venue to impress.", "date_of_review": "31 December 2012"}

This time was a different experience entirely. The atmosphere is of course the same, and still impressive - the views alone are worth a trip up the lift. It's the food and service that fell far short this time, though. We went for an early dinner on Saturday, and were seated around 4:30. The restaurant staff still seemed to be preparing for the evening rush, and I suspect this is in large part what led to the poor food quality and weird service.  We started off with a round of appetizers consisting of the pork belly and the wagyu gyoza. Both tasted ok, but were served luke warm - room temperature really. We ordered salmon rolls for our son, which he enjoyed, and the black cod and fillet from the robata grill for mains, along with a couple of the sushi rolls. The fillet, like the appetizers, was served at room temperature. We'd ordered it medium rare, and it was that, but felt tough, as though it had been sitting for a long time. The cod was actually very nice, and one of the few things we really enjoyed. The rolls we ordered were all decent, and the one with shrimp tempura and chili mayo was actually quite good.  We also ordered a couple of pieces each of yellow tail and salmon from the nigiri sushi selection. We asked our waiter if it was possible to get it aburri style - flame seared on top. He at first told us no, not possible because there was no grill at the sushi bar. A different waiter overheard this and said it was in fact possible, so the initial waiter confirmed our order of sushi, and returned several minutes later with salmon and yellow tail sashimi. We explained that we had ordered the sushi, rather than the sashimi, and he took the dish without comment and returned to the kitchen, coming back several minutes later with the proper dish. Overall, the food was just not up to what we expected from the place - especially given the price.  The service as well was strange. Our waiter seemed impatient most of the time. We spent a minute discussing which main we wanted, and he was shifting from foot to foot, looking at his watch, the kitchen, other waitstaff, etc, and generally giving off the impression that he had better things to do. We told him the first main we wanted, and he said 'very good' and walked off - so we had to call him back to give him the rest of our order, and when we did he seemed quite irritated. One of the strangest parts of the meal was when, shortly after our appetizers arrived, the cleaning staff came in and started mopping the floor around our table. The smell of bleach was an extremely unpleasant accompaniment to the meal, but none of the staff found it even slightly strange that they'd be cleaning around us while we were eating. I saw another table that was boxed in against the window by a 'wet floor' sign at one point.  As I mentioned at the start of this review, I think a number of these issues were due to the staff preparing for the evening rush, but this is absolutely no excuse. If you're going to keep your restaurant open between lunch and dinner, you should be prepared to give the guests that visit during that time the same quality of food and service as you would at any other time. And mopping the floors between tables that are seated is just weird, and unprofessional.", "date_of_review": "7 January 2013"}

We arrived early to have a view drinks before the meal. The bar is small, only three bar staff and due to the array of cocktails on offer it did take sometime to be serviced. Three drinks = \u00a339 but they were delicious. The bar area was very crowded and we were unable to go upstairs due to a private function so forced to stand, in killer heels!  For the smokers - there is a lovely terrace area over looking the city. Blankets are provided and a large fire to keep warm. There was a bar outside but this was closed. We were shown to our tables, the chairs are heavy but the waiters did assist. The food was okay but not out of this world. The staff presented my friend with a birthday dessert and sang happy birthday.  Staff were friendly and willing to help.

I regret this decision as I was overwhelmed with the degree of dissapointment I felt. In fairness service and therefore ambience are the real problems. I have never experienced such a degree of pretenciousness in London before as I did here and that's really saying something!  In the first place they choose to try and create a sense of exclusivity by being aloof as to whether you can get a reservation at all- which is not that unusual in a big place like London.  When I eventually made mine 5 days in advance I was told by the person I made it with that we had 2.5hrs in order to finish, only to be contradicted on the day(!), by perhaps the rudest woman in the industry, that we had Only 2 hours and that we would be asked to give up our table if we over ran(???!!!) After this unpleasant telephone episode I arrived at the dedicated entrance on the side of the Heron tower to be greeted by a confusing security door. I had to buzz in order to be granted the attention of the smartly dressed guardian to the restaurant, only for him to further annoy me.  He told us that even though we had a reservation we 'might' get our table....errrr sorry? We've got reservations??? I thought because English wasn't his 1st language I misunderstood and gave him the benefit of the doubt only to be told the same thing by others in my party that arrived slightly later than me AND to see him doing exactly the same thing again to a group on the way out!! It looked almost scripted. Once reaching the 38th floor you realise that there's no sign indicating that this is Sushi Samba, the reason this is a problem is because another restaurant is directly above them- I wonder how many people arrive at Duck and Waffle thinking they're at Sushi Samba? After deciphering that I had the correct place I arrived at the reception recognising the frosty voice of the charming lady that stole my 30 mins on the phone earlier. She greeted me with the disdain that I was now expecting and handed me over to my hostess. The table staff were nice and acceptably helpful. They knew their menus and were genuine when trying to advise, but still had the air of grandeur that you expect from a Michelin starred French restaurant, which can be easily fixed (hopefully). The management made some effort to make sure we were okay and kept things in order on the floor- perhaps blissfully unaware that customers were being put off by staff before actually getting to that point- what does that say about their abilities? (if management respond to this review- I respectfully decline emailing you, I'll just go back to the NYC branch and avoid you like the plauge) On a positive note it really isnt expensive and the food was excellent, it is an honest attempt of trying to combine flavours from two culinary distinct cultures and it works! The food takes far too long to get to you but that's bearable as you have the views and decor to feed your senses till it arrives.", "date_of_review": "19 December 2012"}

One of our clients became separated from the group because there was no room left in the lift when we all boarded. Not a major problem you would think, he can join us in the next lift. This is a problem however, when the door staff suddenly decide to stop letting people without reservations into the venue. Our client told the door staff that he was the last remaining member of a group that had just gone into the restaurant but was bluntly told that he was not getting in, end of story. Thankfully he managed to call us before we ordered drinks and the entire party was forced to leave and go somewhere else.

Me and my friend were thoroughly impressed with the food. Not necessarily the 'best' sushi we had had but the inventive recipes and combinations for sushi was refreshing and truly delicious. It was bordering on expensive but I guess part of the bill is the location and it was not extortionate. Me and my partner ended up with a bill of around \u00a375 if I remember correctly. The gentleman we had serving us was very nice and always on hand, we were at the sushi bar. The views were beautiful but although I did not get the opportunity to explore the whole restaurant, I feel that it could have been made more accessible. Perhaps when seated at a table rather than the sushi bar, the higher level may offer a better viewing platform. The main negative of the place is what I have heard in many of the other reviews. It seems as if they have tailored the place to serve the bankers in the area and have to maintain a somewhat exclusive seeming entry policy which appears to be smart dress for men and any trashy essex bird looking for a wealthy husband. Im sure you can guess what kind of atmosphere this tends itself to inside. Very superficial, lots of tarted up women wearing different colours of the same tight dress, arrogant men trying to flaunt it and a lot of staff, especially door staff who seem to make lots of judgments of you based on your clothing or how you speak. Now I was well dressed at the time and speak well due to my education but I still felt myself being scrutinized unnecessarily especially considering the mouthy essex woman demanding a table next to me because 'Shut aap, I need to get get in quick and get a drink down me'.

The food was beautifully prepared and presented by dedicated chefs, and the service from a young man from Barcelona was first class. And good wine. They have an outside terrace, with a firepit, and a beautiful lit up ornamental tree, which also looks amazing, but this was closed because of high winds. Next time I will keep my fingers crossed for this as well!!", "date_of_review": "13 December 2012"}

The food is fresh and delicious, and the view spectacular. After 6 visits unfortunately, their service has deteriorated, painfully so. Yesterday I took some very important clients for lunch. At one point I gave my credit card to the manager by their computer station and asked him to make sure I paid for the bill. He recognised me from prior visits and said no problem. When my clients left to take some sunset pictures, our server acknowledged they had my card all ready. Once I asked for the check, they couldn't find my card. Obviously they had a change of staff from lunch to dinner, and the new server knew nothing about it. A second server approached us, (french) bald with glasses, and he proceeded to berate me and question me as if I committed some crime. I was mortified. I had to stop him after a 10 minute interrogation, and asked him to go to the side to discuss this, away from my clients. I asked to speak to his manager. Minutes later, another very young frenchman came charging at me. Never gave me the opportunity to explain what happened, and clearly based on what the server told him, he demanded an explanation aggressively. Apparently in an American restaurant, the concept of the customer is always right, or at the very least given the benefit of the doubt, hasn't crossed the pond yet. I asked him to stop, and give me an opportunity to explain myself. Once I did, he denied my story, as restaurant policy is to give customers a numbered card, in lieu of a stored credit card. Unfortunately I wasn't given one. Needless to say I finally snapped. How is this any of my fault? Eventually, after a 30 minute incident, another server casually walked by with my credit card, as the previous server had given it to him. So yes I cursed them both, and the day they were born, for I have never been humiliated like this before. At that point no apologies from either frenchmen, too arrogant to recognise that they're supposedly working a nice restaurant and who clearly, have allowed the heights of Sushi Samba to go to their heads.  If it weren't for the lovely Maitre d' who saw our group visibly shaken on the way out, and took a genuine interest in us, the whole day was ruined. At this rate, it won't take long for London to take notice. NEVER AGAIN", "date_of_review": "12 December 2012"}

I should say now that I am not a big foody and don't claim to know all there is about food, only what I like and what i don't, BUT, if you're expecting something along the lines of Roka or Zuma etc then forget it.  It's well presented but lacked in taste and quality and didn't have that feeling of being fresh , although I'm sure it was, it just didn't taste that way.The sushi and rolls were just plain average to poor.  My fiance is South American and we were also expecting more from the latin twist but didn't get it. The plantains were OK but the tamales were really dry and flavourless and just didn't taste right at all.

I've never written an online review, but the service was so bad I felt compelled to.  After waiting roughly 15 minutes to be served at the bar, my drink was made incorrectly without an apology. It then took 45 minutes to receive a cup of tea - the wrong cup of tea.  I had been up once to check on it's status where the staff took a very strange approach to customer service and didn't give an apology.  After 40 minutes, I complained to the manager who first ignored my ask to talk. He then proceeded to discuss/ argue with the bar person. He then apologised by telling me, in a very rushed way, the bar staff should have notified him. He did not offer a free drink or real apology. For a bar/ restaurant that is aiming to attract people who happy to pay \u00a312 + for a cocktail, the service just isn't up to standard. Anywhere at these prices where you might have waited 45 minutes to receive something as simple as a tea would have responded in a very different way.  After all this, comedy ensued when it was found that we, along with roughly 12 other people, had been seated on an art installation. The manager then proceeded to rush around sweeping the 'chairs' from under us. We were all left in confusion.  The lack of seating in the bar and the layout is just terrible and wastes, what are, amazing views. If you are looking for city views I would look elsewhere.", "date_of_review": "3 December 2012"}

Amazing lift up to the restaurant where we were kept waiting for our table for nearly 10 mins, despite being on time ish (5 mins late) We were shown to a fantastic table overlooking North London, lovely. We had a charming waiter who brought over our menus, yes there are 3 of them, food cocktails and wine. 1 Nina Fresa @ 10.50 value 4/5 1 Kaffirihna @ 9.50 value 4/5 ( I wanted the Cha-Cumbra but the didn\u2019t have one of the ingredients but the waiter said I wouldn\u2019t have noticed the difference anyway) odd thing to say about an ingredient. This theme would shine through. First thing we ordered was Hamachi Nigiri ( I was corrected on the pronunciation ) @ 11 This was nice, the rice was room temp and both pieces even though they were very small were tasty. Value for Money? 2/5 Second was the Jalea Seviche @ 10 value 4/5 (sic) This was three pieces of squid (rings) on top of a seviche of white tail fish? with the classic accompaniments of shaved onion, peppers and lime juice and thai green curry \u2018milk\u2019?.  Third was the pork belly @ 12 value 5/5, this dish comprised of small cubes of deep fried but melting pork belly on a small leaf with citrus and pepper shavings. I could have eaten a kilo of this stuff, amazing. SO well flavoured and balanced. For mains (but you can\u2019t call them mains at SushiSamba, you will get in trouble) we had Grade 9 Waygu @ 49 value 3.5/5 that you cook yourself on a very VERY hot stone. Even the waiter commented on it being a little too hot. This comes with a selection of sauces, bizarrely they supply you with sesame oil for stopping the meat stick which flavours very strongly, a soy and spring onion, and two others that were not worth mentioning. Meh, it was nice and tasty but not worth \u00a349. We also ordered duck with foie gras ontop of rice @ 28 value 4/5. The combination of the duck and foie gras was epic but the rice, what on EARTH were they thinking about. It was some kind of warm, rice pudding affair with not enough seasoning. once combined with the mushroom sauce (waaaait, I will get to that in a min) which was a sharp soy and yuzu flavour made all the difference. The rice has to go! for sides we got some asparagus @8.5 value 1/5 and mushrooms @8 value 5/5!  Asparagus was just that, grilled and I could do the same in less than 30 seconds on a BBQ for 1/8th of the price. Mushrooms were fat, plump, juicy and delicious! sharp from the soy, tangy from the yuzu ( I think it was that anyways ) an utter delight! put the juice on the rice from the duck dish to make it edible.  For dessert we ordered the Yuzu tart @ 12 value 5/5 - amazing! blown suger, little meringues, crumble base and other tastes I couldn\u2019t work out! stand out dish for me.  Second dessert was Red choc chilli @ 9.5 value 4/5 - lovely dessert, nice tastes and great presentation. Overall. Food was good, not worth the price tag IMO but good all the same. The desserts were fantastic! well thought out and presented. It was a shame we had to wait nearly 40 mins for them to arrive as we were on the cusp of walking out due to the wait. Wine was nice, we had a bottle of St. Veran Thomas Burgundy @ 40 value 4/5 Water, well we order once bottle but were charged for 2 as the waiter got us a second without asking if we wanted to shell out another \u00a34. I was annoyed by this. Service. 1/5 - this was the major problem. I counted my chair being knocked by waiters and waitresses on more than 21 occasions during the meal as after about the 5th or 6th time I was sad enough to start counting. I asked for no cilantro (as it is called on the menu, I know it is coriander) and was CORRECTED that it was indeed coriander as it arrived on my main even though I had asked for none! We were kept waiting for too long at the start and charged for water we didn\u2019t order. Would we go back? no. Would we recommend it? no. Why? There is better food, abet without the view, for the money. @\u00a3243 for a meal for 2 with one bottle of wine and two cocktails I expect more from the food and a hell of a lot more from the staff.  I did however have a fantastic time and really enjoyed my time looking out over London, maybe if I was a banker with no grasp of money and its value I would have had a better time. Looking out over the restaurant and the client\u00e8le, it seems this place will continue to be busy, simply, there are far too many bankers with far too much money to warrant this restaurant changing a damn thing!

I have mixed feelings - mainly due to the service. It was very inconsistent and slow. Half the staff did not seem to know what they were doing. This was probably due to the fact the restaurant had recently opened, but I do not think that this is acceptable for a restaurant of this calibre. I believe the restaurant was in the soft-opening stage, but we found this out at a later date. We ordered wine to start - it did not arrive. Asked a waiter, wine still did not arrive. We asked several times and eventually they brought the wine, but it was the wrong one. They finally brought the right wine, at least 25 / 30 minutes after we first sat down!  When the mains came, my side of quinoa did not arrive. I asked and asked but it did not appear. Eventually they said it is being made. By the time it came I had finished my main and they told me it was on the house. I would expect this, and would have much rather have paid for it and had it with my main at the same time. The food itself was delicious. Most of the staff were friendly although all seemed hurried, and often did not stop even when they could see us trying to get their attention. It is a shame - I had high expectations of Sushi Samba. It is just near my office, fantastic location and is somewhere that I would be keen to frequent had I been impressed with my initial visit. I am willing to give Sushi Samba another chance - but if the service is a repeat of last time then I shall not return again.", "date_of_review": "15 November 2012"}

When finally securing a table for two, I was looking forward to the night with abandon. After being whizzed by glass lift to the 39th floor, and enjoying a couple of cocktails at the outdoor roof terrace bar, enjoying spectcular views of London and to the east the whole Olympic Park, I was ready to eat, and was hungry. My partner and I ordered three starters to share, and a main each. The starters came and were divine, the mains however really disappointed, bland and rather tasteless. After dinner we made our way to the bar inside and orderd a few more cocktails. The bar staff were rather rude and abrupt, and I think I finally got to the bottom of this in my mind before I left. How the heck can staff in a customer service environment be chirpy, happy and friendly when their superiors are terrible control freks. The whole evening the manager's were much more concerned with marching round the restaurant and bar, pointing here, and pointing there, wanting nothing more than to look important on theiir walkie talikies than either the well-being of their staff or customers.

Staff were lovely, friendly, over helpful and very ineffective, seemed to be about how much water they could serve (are all waiting staff in major cities on water commission ?) and how quickly they got the food to you. This meant dishes randomly turning up as they were ready, told it was part of the charm. The set up is also a little strange with the general feel of squeezing in what they could to the space given, the place probably works best in the summer when the outside 39th floor balcony will really kick in, but again, you will be there for London not SS, unlike in the states where the restaurant is on par with Nobu.

We had a table by the window...and again we come to the view...I felt like I saw London for a first time ever...:) . Now service : Very friendly and helpful , the guy asked as if we ever been there before , and if we need help with the menu and while I was waiting for my friend to come back and just looking around , the manager(which I found out later) came to me just to say \"Hello\" ,if I'm waiting for somebody , do I like the place ,that they open just before the Olympics , and still working on the menu , service etc... he told me a lot about the food - that they trying to accommodate all tastes and that's why you can have sushi as you know it or even if you are not a great sushi lover like me -you will find something to eat- sushi American Style :)...and I loved it ! Breakdown : 2 glasses of Red wine , 1 Bloody Mary , 2 plates of sushi , 1 bottle of water -\u00a3 60 . Not bad I believe..., ahhh and yes , some coated, fried French beans on the house...:) , very tasty I have to say ,coming from someone who eats vegetables because I have to , not because I like to... Also they have this great terrace , but it was closed at the time because of the strong wind, as we been told , but I can see myself next summer sitting outside watching the world go by ... Bottom line : Highly recommended !", "date_of_review": "5 November 2012"}

Particular favourites from what was ordered on the night - rock shrimp tempura in spicy mayo, the wagyu beef served on the hot stone and the lamp chop robata................all extremely tasty.

Location is convenient (2-3 mins walk from Liverpool St station) and the situation on the 38th floor simply stunning - with the added excitement of a very fast-moving lift! The bar is what one would expect from a new glitzy/upmarket City bar both in terms of appearance and clientele.  Our visit got off to a bad start when we were seat 45 minutes late, bad enough but it was a 9pm reservation so we didn't eat before 10pm! This was unacceptably poor and very disappointing from such an establishment that no compensation was offered (e.g. free glass of wine). Once we sat though, the experience was wonderful, a real treat. The restaurant was busy and humming with activity and not overwhelmed by the bar at all. The food was fabulous, el topo and samba London rolls were a particular delight. As per previous reviews, I did find the wine list sky-rocketed but we enjoyed a nice white for \u00a325 which was fine (twice!). Price-wise it did feel like everything came with a \u00a32-3 premium for what it was, which, when you don't have the view because it's dark and foggy made it feel a little pricey. That said, \u00a355 per head including half a bottle of wine each and half a bottle of mineral water isn't bad - I've certainly paid similar for worse food and experience. Definitely recommend, as a treat rather than a regular occassion though.", "date_of_review": "25 October 2012"}

The entire experience was awful. There is a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant at the moment, which is completely unjustified.  The staff were anal, rude, and incompetent (especially ill mannered, badly dressed hostesses who had huge chips on their shoulders and had clearly received no training). I have never been treated so badly by staff in a restaurant, and were it not for the fact that this restaurant is in the middle of nowhere, making it difficult to move to another restaurant, we would have left before starting our meal. The restaurant itself was absolutely freezing to the point that we had to put our coats on while we were eating (it felt like we were sitting in a draughty conservatory) and our table was in the middle of a walkway right next to the till, so we had the pleasure of enjoying hearing the manager shout at the waiters all evening. We asked to move up to the next table which was empty and in a less noisy and draughty position, but were refused, for absolutely no reason.  The food was \u201ctake out\u201d sushi standard, and one dish was so burnt we had to send it back. Food quality to value ratio was extremely poor. There are far better Japanese and South American restaurants in London, in more central locations, with far better food, better service and at a better value.  The restaurant is trying to appeal to an exclusive international crowd, but the reality was very different. This restaurant works well in the States because it appeals to the masses, the atmosphere is casual and the prices are reasonable, which match the quality of the food. However, here, the restaurant is trying to appeal to a better crowd, and tries to market itself at an up-market venue serving great food with perfect service. It fails dismally on all accounts.  The only redeeming feature of this restaurant is the view (which we were unable to see from our table).

We were a party of 6 and most of dishes were set up for 4-5 people so at least one person missed out on each dish. In my opinion the wait staff should have explained this so that we could have ordered more portions.  After we had eaten all that we had first ordered, the table was cleared and dessert menus were given out despite us being told we could order main dishes as we needed them.

Think i was expecting an updated Patrick Bateman-esque experience, on a Thursday night too, when the city gets on it. FAIL. Amazing views over the city but aside, just full of the usual suits trying to impress someone. Managed to get seats at the bar to eat. Restaurant fully booked as you'd expect. So we hit the menu. Selection of rolls. Nice. Wagyu beef on a hot stone. V nice. Jalape\u00f1o yellowtail, my favourite but just OK. Wine list rockets from 25-30 quid to 80-100 to 200 plus pretty quick so if you're a 'choose the 3rd from the bottom' trying to make a good impression then they've got you.

Menu card, was dirty, cocktails not great. Overall, still an enjoyable experience, they haven't been opened for long so few things need fine tuning....

I would say the food is more of a gourmet, high end quality there whereas Sushisamba is a place to have cocktails and some fusion food. Having said that I loved the Brazilian dish on the menu - it was great and the ceviche was fresh and tasty. As I say, there are some really unfair reviews of this restaurant.

The lift up Heron Tower is just as spectacular as the views at the top, which has some of the best views in London - its funny as I really felt I was in Tokyo where one spend most of you existence at 40 floors. We were lucky with the wind and it was lovely outside (shame about the smokers). Its a beautiful restaurant with lovely decor, a great place and comfortable place to eat. My big bone of contention with this place though is the service, there are plenty of places in London where I can get this quality of food at a much cheaper price, I dont mind paying these prices but both the food and the service must be excellent.  I felt the waiters were very inexperienced, not knowing how to pronounce things on the menu as well as knowing the menu partucularily well, that made making choices on the menu quite difficult to make. Due to thier lack of understanding of the menu we also ended up with food on our table we didnt order, and some items missing. There were many staff there but things just seemed very disorganised and asking for a waiters assistance ended up being a long waiting game at times. I could see many staff waiting by the side who did not react to our calls for assistance - with a \"not my job\" look on their faces. I wrote this review as a call out to the management to get their act together, I dont want to detract from the great food, many of the issues with service could be easily ironed out with better management and staff training.", "date_of_review": "19 September 2012"}

Positive: - spectacular views - several bar areas, outside terrace, nice decor Negative: - slow service during busy periods - average/poor food quality - completely overpriced - staff try too hard to sell lots of stuff After we were seated the waiters started to explain the menu which is a good idea unless you comment on almost every dish on the menu, and how phantastic it is. After 3 minutes I couldn't remember anything he told us. The waiter has a story for every dish and how it is prepared, and every dish is every waiters favourite. Also, staff are trying hard to sell small bites, beans and dips - which are absolutely nothing special to me.  Initially, the service was good, and food was brought to our table quickly. As the restaurant filled with business people it got slower and slower. There was at least a 30 minute break between starters and main course, and by the time the main was delivered I wasn't hungry anymore. The quality was mixed: all dishes look extremely well presented on the plate, but didn't taste very special. The strategy in the kitchen seems to be to put a lot of truffle oil on everything, which is very intense (and tastes ok), but of course kills any other flavors. The exotic food combinations seem somewhat strange to me, and you should only come here if you like unusual dishes. In my personal opinion cooking is not about mixing all sorts of exotic flavors and spices together in one dish - this trend has long passed. Simplicity and pureness are far more important. For instance, the waiter mentioned that the scallops were cooked somehow with tuna to make them crisp on the outside while remaining soft on the inside. To me, these were the strangest tasting scallops I have ever been served (very fishy). Why would you force another fishy flavor onto scallops? Be informed that there is no ordinary side dish on the menu, no potatos, normal rice (without coconut milk in it), normal vegetables...  The scallops, as well as a duck egg accompanying a main course were slightly undercooked. I am unsure if this is the reason why I didn't feel well a few hours after lunch... Luckily I did not try any sushi which my colleagues ordered for our table (personal dislike) - I don't think all products are as fresh as they should be. This is somewhat speculative, but would not surprise given the commercial nature of US chain restaurants. However, back to more objective and serious points: the numbers don't lie - unfortunately(!), as I couldn't believe my ears when I was told that lunch was 65 pounds per head - as we only had coke for drinks, this is almost all due to food! The amount and quality of food does not even remotely justify this price. You can easily have lunch at a Michelin star restaurant for less. Therefore, I can only conclude that given the average quality, slow service at the end, the value for money of this lunch experience was the worst in my life! PS: If you like views, there are far better restaurants in London which offer great views. A champagne ride on the London Eye (Fast Track) will also be a cheaper alternative...", "date_of_review": "20 September 2012"}

What we didn't realise was what a truly terrible night was ahead of us and no the views don't make up for it. First of all we went to the bar area to wait for the rest of our party. There were at least ten staff there but only two bagmen serving. I ordered a cocktail&a gin and tonic. Ten minutes later the cocktail was ready (nobody indicates that is your drink- I guess psychic abilities are de rigeur). After a further 20 min wait and going up and ordering another person a cocktail (which was made) I asked another bar man to make me a gin&tonic. How hard is that?! Gin plus tonic is not a 30 min wait drink! First barman then slams down original g&t a few mins after 2nd one. I refuse to pay for either as it's just plain ridiculous \"service\"made worse by seeing more staff milling around but noone serving. Oh and the cocktail list is crap! None of the great cocktails in the USA branches. There were further issues when my friend tried to then move to the table, blocked by a member of staff who thought we didn't have a reservation but didn't bother to listen or speak with us civilly.  Then came food debacles. First of all most of the wines had \"sold out\" we were recommended a horrible one. Then food orders came out in dribs and drabs. Some of the items we ordered never came to our table but we were helpfully told \"we haven't charged you for the last one\" off course you bloody shouldn't, we didn't get it!!!!! The food tasted great but the overall experience was shambolic, stressful and enjoyable. The manageress did try to resolve our issues with some \"free desserts\" but it was too little too late. At over 60 pounds a head I won't be back. Recommend spending your money elsewhere and if you have to see the view take the elevator up have a look and come down because you won't get served at the bar anytime soon anyway.", "date_of_review": "1 September 2012"}

The restaurant is part of a group which has a fairly good reputation. Everyone who works there is trying there best to be genial and well meaning but the service just does not gel at all. It was very busy with city types drinking beer straight from the bottle at \u00a36 which was the cheapest alcohol you could have at the outside bar. The night we went the refigeration had broken down so these beers were having to be cooled in large buckets of ice and water. It was so windy that cocktail lists etc were blowing away down to the pavement of the City below. I can't imagine what it is going to be like in one our cold winters. There is no clear indication as to where you eat or can just drink. The men's lavatory has space for just two people and am surprised that for a restaurant and bar this size which must hold at least 250 people there are not more space devoted to this necessity. The food however was good and did come out of the kitchen within a reasonable time. At the same price as Nobu there was nothing to compare the two, Nobu every time.

They seem to have strict rules: closing the terrace after the merest hint of rain. That might have had something to do with their reluctance to give me a table with a view. So best to pick a cloudless day. Even then you might have to dodge a leak from the ceiling in the indoor bar area, which seemed unrelated to any rain The prices were almost as elevated as the restaurant, so I limited myself to a Kaffirinha (sic) - a pointless variation on a great drink, 2 sea urchin nigiri (passable but so new to me I was not sure what to make of it, but even I knew more than the engaging waiter who well after advising me to go for the nigiri rather than the sashimi confessed he had never eaten raw fish!), a stunningly good Jalea sashimi seviche (sic): squid tempura, white \ufb01sh, sweet potato, aji limo, fresh jalape\u00f1o, leche de tigre; and a (too-subtle for me) mango-coriander mousse.

Undoubtably this must have the finest views in London. We arrive 30 mins before our table was due to get some drinks at the bar. Unfortunately the weather was bad so we couldn't enjoy the outside bar area. No offer to take our coats so had to stand there with them. I told the staff to get us at 9pm when out table was ready. At 9.05 I asked if we cold sit down as we were getting very hungry but was greeted with a blank look. At 9.15 we were eventually taken to our table. We ordered more drinks which took over 20 mins to arrive. We asked our waiter for some suggestions and whilst he seemed very nice we all found it very difficult to understand him. We eventually ordered and the food was superb. The twist of Japanese and south American is excellent and if I was just commenting on the food i would have given it 4 or 5 out of 5. After our mains and thirty minutes later we had to ask for the dessert menus and coffees. Overall we had a good evening due to the company and food. Ordering further drinks again took over 20 minutes and confusion in some cases and the drinks bill would have been far higher if not being so slow. For the prices the service needs to be greatly improved. We spent over 600 pounds for the 6 of us which is on par with nobu and Zuma.

We have been waiting for a long time for this venue to be opened, delayed a couple of times. Finally we got to try this eagerly awaited restaurant!  The panoramic views are breathtaking. There is an outdoor bar area & then an open space the other side, reported to be the highest outdoor space in London! We popped out there after our lunch & took in the views of Tower Bridge, Greenwich & the Olympic Park! The staff were very welcoming, friendly & attentive. They offered advice on the menu as I was a little confused what certain dishes were!  Let's cut to the chase. The food is expensive, so visiting this restaurant would only be for a special treat for some people, including me. The inside was bright & airy, high ceilings, but higher than Duck & Waffle, located above on the 40th floor. Back to the food & menu, many of the dishes are unusual, so we decided to order a few plates at a time to see portion sizes & decide as we go. Pretty much the same as when you dine at D&W above! We ordered skewers of the Chicken Teriyaki (safe) but also ordered a bunch of the Samba Rolls. A variety of rolls - an assortment of Crab, Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail, Prawn, Scallop, Wagyu, Avocado, Tempura, Wasabi Mayo, Aji panca & a housemade soy reduction.  We also ordered the EL TOPO\u00ae (salmon, jalape\u00f1o, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzarella, crispy onion) which was our favourite! We were actually full by then & after 1 drink each & a coffee the bill was very high, but we knew it wouldn't be cheap!

The is an outdoor bar/terrace with spectacular views over London - St. Paul's Cathederal, The Gherkin, and The Shard all in full view.

Now onto the food - as it's name suggests the food is a fusion between Japanese and South American cuisine. I must admit I found the menu a little bit confusing but the waiters were happy to explain everything without being patronising - they suggested we go for a combination of some of the small plates, the sushi, the raw section and the grill section and share them between us. There is the option if taking a large plate/main meal if you're a \"it's my dinner and I'm not sharing\" kind of person but there is so much choice on the rest of the menu it would seem a shame to do this.  Our food arrived in stages and was lovely - my favourite by far was the Tuna Tataki - sliced pieces of seared tuna - which was really good. I don't normally do deserts but our waiter suggested we try the Chocolate Banana cake which was more like a chocolate fondant and tasted amazing and the Assorted Mochi which were different flavoured ice cream and sorbet balls wrapped in Japanese rice paper which again were lovely. The wine selection was good and if you are a Sake fan, there was plenty of choice.  Altogether dinner came to around \u00a3170 including wine and service so this place is not cheap.

We learned you do not need to pre book the bar which is good. It's Monday night, they've been open for 3 weeks, it's busy and lively. We sit down to order a bottle of champagne between the 4 of us. None in stock only by the glass. I'm 8 months pregnant and was allowing myself 1 glass of champagne, I ordered 1 glass and it came out flat. Not a bubble in sight, I sent it back.  They replaced it with another, that was slightly better.  The idea is to pick lots of dishes from different sections and share. you can always order more of something, as it comes out quickly. Popping the tempura shrimp in your mouth was a delight, it was so unptious, and perfectly cooked. A good start. We ordered a lot of food to try a large variety, the Japanese/Peruvian/Brazilian fusion works wonderfully, a hint of salsa, fresh lime, wasabi, who'd of ever thought it. The black cod was falling off the skewer perfectly cooked, the lamb chops where melt in your mouth. The rib eye my husband raved about as the most tasty steak he'd eaten, however we where all let down by the wagu beef that you couldn't even cut with a steak knife let alone chew. The poussin teriyaki was a waste if time, boney, hardly any meat, and my husband and I bit into it and it was pink. We where assured by the waiter it was perfectly cooked, they then took away half the dish re cooked it until it had charcoal on it and was dry and brought back the half eaten meal. A big let down they should of replaced it all together. I was asked by the group not to complain again as it may ruin the evening. The civiche salmon pleasure over load in the mouth, the sushi rolls tasty, interesting and creative although I would never put truffle near sushi it dosen't work.  The banana and chocolate cake could do with some work, the one I make at home is tastier than it, but my husband was happy with the chilli chocolate dish. The service was rooky, it felt like they had never worked in a restaurant before. When pouring the wine out initially for the chap who choose the wine, they then forgot to top his glass up. They poured me wine 3 times even though every time I pointed out I wasn't drinking it and that I was very clearly visibly 8 months pregnant. They poured too much wine into the glasses which left it to go warm, when asking for water it wouldn't turn up, the incident with the chicken and no replacing the whole dish etc.  However I say all of this purely for them hopefully to rectify as they are only 3 weeks into opening. The food as a general was fantastic, I will go back and I will recommend it. We where in a joyful mood, and didn't want to let anything get to us we still had a fabulous evening, sat on the terrace over looking the best city in the world it felt like being on holiday. This restaurant is impressive, if they can refine the details it could become my favourite local for food, view, ambiance. Here's hoping!
