Booking & rescheduling due to Covid was easy, however the manner of the staff member over the phone who was ringing to confirm our booking was very rude, to the point that we only attended the meal and did not cancel there and then to avoid a penalty. We arrived and were seated swiftly with a gorgeous view of the Shard. I did not get the name of our waiter, but he was really friendly, knowledgeable and made our evening great. Another staff member, within moments of us sitting down, again reminded us that they needed the table back by 7.30 (we knew this before booking). Completely understandable, but she was very rude and abrupt, and we immediately felt rushed and unwelcome, therefore only bothered ordering a few dishes and one drink before leaving after less than an hour. In particular, the pork was really delicious, as was the pan con tomate. The attentive waiter did present us with an anniversary ice cream, which was again a lovely token. I couldn't fault him at all, but to be honest the damage had already been done. Really disappointing considering the high price point and how excited we were to initially visit.", "date_of_review": "4 November 2020"}

(Honestly the waitresses/waiters we had were friendly, but I think the location may leave some to expect a higher level of service which is fair enough)  We got a few smaller dishes and a bunch of oysters so it was all tapas style. Looking at the small portion size and high prices of some of the main dishes, I think tapas style is the way to go.  My friend and I love ceviche but we weren\u2019t too keen on the scallop ceviche, the corriander based sauce was quite strong for the dish in my opinion.  The octopus roll however, wow!!

He provided recommendations and favourites without being pushy and did everything he could to make my partner's night special which he did excellently. The food was incredible - oysters followed by a combination of tapas style dishes, the croquettas are to die for. The seabass was simply breathtaking with not a bone in site.

So now here I am, writing about it. Let's call this an attempt at personal therapy. Unlike my meal there, I'll be brief.  We had booked a table for 6 people as it was my friend's birthday. The table wasn't ready so we waited for 30 minutes only to then be shown to a table with 4 chairs and a sofa. The sofa was so low that the two friends who got the short straw had to lean forward awkwardly throughout the whole experience. Who was this sofa built for? Shaquille O'Neal? The waiter then spilled an entire pint of beer in the birthday girl's lap. Hey, accidents happen. We've all been there. Let's forget about it. However, the compensatory shots (!?) were about as tasteful a response as the decor.  That decor. Man. Spending time in that room was like hanging out in the Miami penthouse of a 19-year-old tech millionaire with a paraffin lamp obsession and an Ex On The Beach contestant as his interior designer.  We decided to start by sharing the \u00a390+ seafood platter. This amounted to 2 small prawns, 1 oyster, 1 razor clam and 2 TINY muscles each. These weren't quite as tasteless as the decor but it was a photo-finish.  Surely the main course would reverse things...surely. I decided to choose the cheapest thing on the menu. This was in part frugality but also because Mackerel is my favourite fish...even if I do have to fork out \u00a318 to eat one. Yes. \u00a318. One fish, no sides or accompaniment. \u00a318. The cheapest thing on the menu. It was so small when it arrived 50 MINUTES LATER I hardly noticed it had. This \u00a318 whole mackerel was in fact a butterflied fillet of mackerel the size of my mobile phone. I measured it. And it was swimming in so much oil I suspected the chef had had a stroke. I've fished many times for mackerel and know how big one has to be to legally keep it. There is no way I would have done - it was barely out of nappies. \u00a318.  I decided to ask the waitress where it was from. She said she didn't know and would find out but that I shouldn't worry because...wait for it...\"it was definitely local\". LOCAL?! We're in SE1! Where did they land the thing Bermondsey council swimming baths??! The Thames?!? The sink in The Old Vic theatre toilets??! 10 minutes later she came back. Cornwall. Poor bloody fish - it had been alive for barely as long as the courier took to get it here. \u00a318. With fries on the side (you know, to make it even vaguely something one could class as a full meal) we are talking \u00a322. The thing wouldn't have fed my 4 year old niece - nor the mackerel's. By this point we had been in SEABIRD for almost three hours. It was as if we had eaten essentially nothing. We did all have headaches from paraffin poisoning however. When the bill came it was almost \u00a3400. \u00a3400. We didn't even drink much. Of that \u00a340+ was service. There was none. Our waiter explained the menu to us in the way the rules of Eye Spy are explained to 6 year olds, chucked a pint over my mate, and then we never saw him again.  But to be fair the mackerel is local.", "date_of_review": "9 February 2020"}

We\u2019d seen it on the #instagrams.  To start with the positives: the lighting, WOW: everyone in the restaurant had a quaint little #underglow courtesy of dinky little paraffin lamps on each table, and the suspended orbs provided misty tones and ocre hues; gold for the gram. Anyway, we all looked BEAUTIFUL. And that view: DOUBLE WOW. \u2018Grammed it so hard our phones died. Though thinking about it, it\u2019s probably a stretch to credit the restaurant for the view since the view is, really, the sum total of the efforts of precisely everyone NOT in the restaurant. Anyway, benefit of the doubt and all that.  Onto the, um, 'areas for improvement'. The table wasn't ready when we arrived. Alright, we thought, not a problem, we can stand around and have a fifteen quid cocktail instead. We were eventually shown to our table to discover a sofa down one side, yep: a SOFA. I took the hit but it did mean that I was a good 1.5 feet lower in altitude than everyone else, like being in the baby chair. No one would take me seriously and I struggled to access the conversation.  Drinks arrived... 1 x pint poured straight on the lap of the birthday girl. They did bring a round of tequila sorbet shots, or something weird, to make up for it. Accidents happen I suppose, but then again that's easy for me to say: I've got a dry bottom.  I\u2019ve always wanted to see what a \u00a395 seafood platter looks like. In truth I was a little underwhelmed but I guess it would have been impressive in a gallery context. Dali made it work and he only had one lobster at his disposal, not even a Megaclam\u2122. For the uninitiated, a Megaclam\u2122 is a gritty chunk of mollusc sandwiched between two Disney\u2122-sized plates of shell: nature's answer to the Seaburger. Both I and #BirthdayGirl gave it a whirl (you know: #newyearnewyou). It was hard work, but watching the rainbow of expressions on #BirthdayGirl's face as she chewed her way through this briny monster was at least a #beautifulbirthdaymoment, for which the restaurant deserves a significant amount of credit.  The rest of the platter was tastier, though at circa \u00a32 a prawn it left both soul and stomach a little on the empty side. We had an #oystervirgin in the group and the experience wasn\u2019t horrendous enough to put her off for life. It\u2019s all about the small wins.  The main course took so long to arrive there were another couple of birthdays at the table. Me and my friend Harold thought we\u2019d played it safe by ordering the mackerel, though when it eventually turned up it was so small I had to look twice to make sure it was actually there. We worked out it was exactly the same width as my friend's phone, and he doesn't even have the iPhone X. Flirting with the idea of making a complaint Harold asked one of the waitresses where the fish was from, to which she replied, \u2018rest assured sir, everything is local.\u2019 Which given that we were in SE1 was a little baffling. Maybe she meant Waitrose, or the Thames. Anyway, the mackerel didn\u2019t improve with age and #BirthdayGirl\u2019s lobster should have come with a free roll of crime scene tape (not in a good way). The poor thing looked like it had died in a motorway pile up, though at least we know it would have been a local one. I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to look at the sea bass.  At this point two of our party had to leave to go and rescue a babysitter, though in reality we all knew it was the other way round. Desert came: three balls of air with chocolate on top. The air was the best bit. Incidentally, the whole place also smelt like a runway. Perhaps it's jet fuel they're using in those paraffin lamps.  Bill paid and off we went, to begin our fourteen-floored decent back to sanity (whoops there goes gravity). The journey down was quick, on account of the group being the sum total of FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS lighter than we were on the way up. It had worked out at the best part of seventy quid per head, which given that I was still so hungry I had to have a slice of toast is a bit on the steep side I\u2019d say.", "date_of_review": "20 January 2020"}

Visited on a Sunday at 6pm as a group of 4 and we were 1 out of 2 tables in the restaurant. We was originally a table of 5 but we had a last minute drop out and notified them to request to sit at a sofa table of 4. They said they would get back to us but never did. This was only the beginning of the many problems to come. Upon ordering, we were notified that a large portion of the menu was sold out - all of the seafood section including the platters which is basically what we came for, as well as a few other dishes that we were looking forward to try. This was a moment where we were thinking why are we still here. We then ordered our food which came out quite fast to be fair, at this point there were more tables so quick service. Except we ordered some fries which never came and we had to chase up on them. Portions are minuscule, the scallop is literally one scallop and the clams are practically non-existent. However, the oysters were fresh and the octopus roll and sea bream was great. Next up is the biggest issue. We had asked for the bill and upon inspection, we noticed errors on our bill. The sparkling wine we ordered was shown as \u00a345 on the menu but showed up as \u00a350 on the bill and there were 2 orders of the fries on the bill when there was meant to be 1. We notified them of the issue and the waiter went to go investigate. He came back to us to say that the sparkling wine we ordered was out of stock and we were just given a different one. Without notifying us prior. If they had let us know that it was sold out, we could\u2019ve made a different choice but we was just given whatever without being notified. I have never experienced this elsewhere before and as I have worked in hospitality previously, I would never have done this procedure myself as the protocol would typically get back to the customer, apologise that it\u2019s sold out and to ask whether they would like to choose something else. Hence why this was absolutely bizarre. Upon fixing the bill, no apology was made by said waiter and he just dumped the bill onto the table. It was that behaviour where our table was not paying for the service charge as it was simply ridiculous.  Unfortunately, we had a poor experience and we missed out on a lot of the food that was sold out so I do wish to try again but maybe when it\u2019s more established.

While it was a bit cold to dine outside in November, the outdoor space is lovely with stunning views. If the wow-factor of the views wasn't enough, the raw bar in the center of the restaurant is gorgeous and beautifully presented.  Our waiter was helpful in describing the selection of oysters and the few we chose were delicious. We also ordered the Octopus Roll which is not to be missed. We shared the Basque Stew and it was so flavorful, we didn't want it to end! For dessert we opted for the trio of mini cream filled donuts, each one a tasty indulgence. The service was excellent and everyone was very helpful with recommendations. I will definitely be back and cannot wait to visit in the summer as well to take in the London views from the terrace with a cocktail!", "date_of_review": "15 November 2019"}

Some of the seats are low down arm chairs and low down sofas (we were sat at one of these tables) - would be fine for a drink but very strange and uncomfortable to eat a full 2 hour dinner at. Left with a sore back. The service was almost comically bad (but ended up being dealt with very well by a manager who took over our table near the end, explained and apologised a lot, removed the wine and service from our table and gave us a complementary digestif - he was very friendly and helpful - thank you). Arrived at the restaurant and wasn\u2019t greeted by anyone - there were about 2 or 3 people standing around, but because I don\u2019t think they were the greeters and the greeters were busy, it looked like they didn\u2019t think it was their job to greet so they just left us standing there - not a great start. We were placed at the low down uncomfortable table - we asked to move and were reluctantly told yes I suppose we could find you anther seat (as if we were being a total burden). We carried on with the meal and then 50 (fifty) minutes later a lady came up and started to take the things off our table and said \u201cyou want to move, yes?\u201d. Yeh that was 50 minutes ago, it\u2019s probably a bit late now. The communication was obviously not working between all the staff (there are loads of them and it\u2019s quite confusing for the customer what each of them do). We ordered a bottle of wine, it took ages to come then it looked slightly different so I asked the waiter if it was the right one and he said yes. After a few drinks of it, I asked to see the wine list again (had to ask twice for it) and then turned out it was the wrong one - not great. Manager said we could swap, but we were already mid way through it, so was a bit late, especially having been told it was the right one. We didn\u2019t receive the bread that we ordered with our shellfish platter - didn\u2019t end up asking to get it as were starting to feel awkward asking for things - but it ended up being on the bill at the end - also not great. It feels like the restaurant has tried a bit hard to be a cool and trendy set up, but the basics of good service and comfortable seating were just not there at all. As I said, manager dealt with it really well in the end, but the damage was done already - it would have been comically bad for it to happen at a Wetherspoons, never mind an expensive restaurant.", "date_of_review": "17 November 2019"}

The small plate of scallop for \u00a313 is literally one scallop.... The service was slightly overbearing and the food whilst nice was just so expensive for what it was. Our plate of one tiny prawn was taken away by an over zealous waitress before we had eaten all of it.  Halfway through the meal we were brought bread which I imagine we should have been brought at the beginning although we didn't order it. We were then charged \u00a32.50 for this. We were also brought 3 gin and tonics instead of 2 (there were 2 of us at the table) and the third one was on the bill at the end which I had to ask to be removed. The service was muddled and we were served by various different people throughout. All were pleasant but it felt they were all confused.

The restaurant is on the 14th floor of the recently opended Hoxton Hotel and the decor reminds of of Florida (or even St Kilda in Melbourne) with gold accents, basket ceiling lamps, black and white tiled floors and palm trees. There is a very nice terrace area although the view of the Shard is only from inside the restaurant. Service was good with a friendly blonde server taking good care of us. I had the Basque seafood stew which was excellent and they gave us complimentary crab open topped sandwiches (like a bruschetta). The oysters were very good, I am not normally an oyster fan but the creamy oyster was delicious. We also had the octopus roll which was quite nice. My companions had the mackerel (so so, too much oil), crab cakes (could not really taste the crab) and sardines (not bad). We had a side order of the interesting potatoes shaped like small balls. The cheesecake as per the other reviews was very very good, and the donuts were also a crowd pleaser. Yes it is on the pricey side (expect to pay \u00a350 per head) but the atmosphere, views and friendly staff made it a lovely experience on a Saturday afternoon.

They offer \"small plates\" for tapas style eating/starters and we shared the Basque Stew for the main course which I highly recommend. All food was lovely, ambience nice and service was great.

Super, helpful staff, great friendly service. Then decided to see if the Seabird (14th floor) could fit us in for lunch? We were in luck, no problem said the lovely lady at the restaurant reception (whose name I omitted to register) - so I went back down to the bar to collect the other half. We were given a choice of seating and opted to sit opposite the kitchen (always interesting to watch). Two 'starters' - scallop and charred gem, followed by John Dory for two, and accompanied by a Portuguese wine (which slipped down a treat). We shared the starters, and my salad-averse partner adored the charred gem lettuce, then the wonderful John Dory arrived - and my fish-averse partner (unless its scallop or monk-fish) snaffled more it the mains than me!! The service was excellent, attentive - but not too much so, and very friendly. We left after coffee, but not before booking our next visit - if they keep this standard of food and service up, we won't be able to get a table so decided to get in quick!!

Superb! Finally, \"Mark\" the Maitra D` could not do enough to make sure i looked after. I was really sorry and surprised to see the previous review who had such a bad experience with a host, i think it is important to name \"names\" and employ the right people as it seems the experiences have been \"night and day\". As for the criticism on music volume? That is just personal taste and i thought the music created a great vibe and atmosphere. The views were fantastic but that is not why i would go back, for me that was the icing on the cake.
