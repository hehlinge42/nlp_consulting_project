Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has experimental_relax_shapes=True option that relaxes argument shapes that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"xTlL9OnDBlC7"},"source":["# fake_X_test = pd.read_csv(os.path.join('..', 'original', 'test.csv'), index_col=['id'])\n","\n","# # Xy_train['description'].fillna(\"\", inplace=True)\n","# # Xy_train['concatenation'] = Xy_train['title'] + Xy_train['description']\n","# fake_X_test['description'].fillna(\"\", inplace=True)\n","# fake_X_test['concatenation'] = fake_X_test['title'] + fake_X_test['description']\n","\n","# Xy_train['description'].fillna(Xy_train['title'], inplace=True)\n","# Xy_train['len_description'] = Xy_train['description'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(' ')))\n","\n","# fake_X_test['description'].fillna(fake_X_test['title'], inplace=True)\n","# fake_X_test['len_description'] = fake_X_test['description'].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(' ')))\n","\n","# def fill_next(description, len):\n","\n","#     if len <= 128:\n","#         return description\n","#     elif len > 128 and len <= 256:\n","#         desc_list = description.split(' ')\n","#         # print(desc_list)\n","#         desc_list = desc_list[-128:]\n","#         # print(desc_list)\n","#         return ' '.join(desc_list)\n","#     else:\n","#         desc_list = description.split(' ')[128:256]\n","#         return ' '.join(desc_list)\n","\n","# Xy_train['next'] = Xy_train.apply(lambda x: fill_next(x['description'], x['len_description']), axis=1)\n","# fake_X_test['next'] = fake_X_test.apply(lambda x: fill_next(x['description'], x['len_description']), axis=1)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":393},"id":"8xSBYAXmI8nn","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615749006190,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":865,"user":{"displayName":"Maxime Redstone","photoUrl":"","userId":"17837963190421977773"}},"outputId":"466f3194-d3b2-4553-eac3-8856b3ee9f60"},"source":["drop_dup['description'].fillna(drop_dup['title'], inplace=True)\n","drop_dup['concatenation'] = drop_dup['title'] + drop_dup['description']\n","drop_dup.head()"],"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/pandas/core/series.py:4536: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  downcast=downcast,\n","/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:2: SettingWithCopyWarning: \n","A value is trying to be set on a copy of a slice from a DataFrame.\n","Try using .loc[row_indexer,col_indexer] = value instead\n","\n","See the caveats in the documentation: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html#returning-a-view-versus-a-copy\n","  \n"],"name":"stderr"},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>class</th>\n","      <th>title</th>\n","      <th>description</th>\n","      <th>len_description</th>\n","      <th>len_title</th>\n","      <th>concatenation</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>Samsung 32-inch Curved LED Monitor (Ultra- Sli...</td>\n","      <td>1800R curved monitor with 3000:1 contrast rati...</td>\n","      <td>62.0</td>\n","      <td>9.0</td>\n","      <td>Samsung 32-inch Curved LED Monitor (Ultra- Sli...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>HotHands Body &amp; Hand Super Warmers - Long Last...</td>\n","      <td>Bring the Heat!,HotHands Body &amp; Hand Super War...</td>\n","      <td>525.0</td>\n","      <td>26.0</td>\n","      <td>HotHands Body &amp; Hand Super Warmers - Long Last...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection - P...</td>\n","      <td>Celebrate the 30th Anniversary of the iconic S...</td>\n","      <td>25.0</td>\n","      <td>10.0</td>\n","      <td>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection - P...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Pioneer Pet Replacement Pump and Transformer</td>\n","      <td>Replacement pump for Pioneer Pet Fountains.
