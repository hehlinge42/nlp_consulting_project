# Word embedder

This session aims at embedding the words resulting from the tokenization of the TripAdvisor's reviews. Preliminary ML techniques are applied to classify the ratings in order to assess the efficiency of the different embedding techniques.


## Architecture

The embedder has the following subfolders:
* ``` src ``` : contains all the ```.py``` files.
* ```notebooks ```: contains Jupyter notebooks to provide some visualisation and a Spark implementation of the lsi embedding in order to perform it with large datasets. 
* ``` trained_models ```: contains the ```.h5``` files to import the pretrained models without needing to run the heavy training optimization process.
* ``` embedded_data ```: contains the embedded reviews and their associated rating vectors.
* ```tensorboard_logs```: contains tensorboard to launch the vizualization without computing again the hyperparameters optimization (see the Vizualization section below) 


## Run from Command Line

From the root of ```embedder``` folder:
```
python3 src/main.py --embed=True --cleaned_data_dir --embedded_data_dir --model=True --trained_models_dir
```

Usage:
* --embed [bool]: If set to True, the words embedding will be conducted using the lsi, word2vec and fasttext techniques. /!\ These processes are time and RAM consuming. See the **Spark implementation** section below. If set to False, the files will be read from the ```./embedder/embedded_data``` folder. False by default.
* --cleaned_data_dir [str]: Directory containing cleaned data (path relative to root of git)
* --embedded_data_dir [str]: Directory to save embedded data (path relative to root of git)
* --model [bool]: If set to True, Deep Neural Networks will be trained in order to predict the rating of the review from its embedding version. Ignored if set to False. False by default.
* --trained_models_dir [str]: Directory to save classification models

## Spark implementation

In order to avoid the RAM issue of conducting embedding techniques on large datasets, we implemented a Spark version of the lsi embedding. If ran on a distributed cluster, this code enables to parallelize the RAM consuming operation (TruncatedSVD) on several machines. 
This code is accessible in the ```notebooks/svd_spark.ipynb ``` notebook and in the ```src/src/spark_lsi.py ``` file.


## Visualize the outcome of ML Techniques performed on the different embedding techniques

Notebooks are provided in the ```notebooks``` folder to show some vizualization of the Machine Learning algorithms trained on the embedded data.
* The notebook ```embedding_performance_comparison.ipynb``` does hyperparameter tuning on each embedding technique and implements TensorBoard to vizualize the outcomes. This notebook is designed to be run on Google Colab's GPU to optimize performances
* The notebook ```tensorboard_monitor.ipynb``` loads Tensorboard with the logs provided in the folder ```tensorboard_logs``` to avoid running the hyperparameters optimization
* The notebook ```lgbm_xgb_comparison.ipynb``` implements RandomForestClassifiers to predict the rating of the reviews based on the embedding matrix and presents the results.
* The notebook ```svd_spark.ipynb``` shows the code to distribute the LSI embedding on a cluster of machines.


## Data Available in the repository

The folder ``` embedded_data ``` contains the output from running ``` python3 main.py --embed ``` to process the tokenized data available in the folder ``` ../cleaner/cleaned_data/ ```.
When rynning from command line, 4 subfolders are created in the ``` embedded_data ``` folder corresponding to the 4 embedding techniques that we performed:
* ``` embedded_data/lsi ```
* ``` embedded_data/spark_lsi ```: a parallelized version of LSI supported by Spark
* ``` embedded_data/word2vec ```
* ``` embedded_data/fasttext ```
The folder ``` embedded_data/zip``` contains compressed embedded data to avoid performing the embedding again (RAM consuming)

Each subfolder contains the 5 files. For example, the ```embedded_data/spark_lsi ```:
* ```spark_lsi.csv```

A training set corresponding to 80% of the reviews from the ```spark_lsi.csv``` file. The different labels (corresponding to ratings from 1 to 5) are equally balanced. The target is one-hot-encoded as vectors of size 5. 
* ```X_train_spark_lsi.csv```
* ```y_train_spark_lsi.npy```

A testing set corresponding to 20% of the reviews from the ```spark_lsi.csv``` file. The different labels (corresponding to ratings from 1 to 5) are equally balanced. The target is one-hot-encoded as vectors of size 5.
* ```X_test_spark_lsi.csv```
* ```y_test_lsi.npy```
